    "text": "What was I saying. I am putting my face on for the second time this morning. My brow, my cheeks, my chin receding into the featureless landscape of the unguents. I am drawing on the eyebrows, which have largely vanished after years of preening. Hurrying this time. The sun has left the bathroom so I move, following a line of orange colouring marker on the skirting boards that dips and rises to our daughters’ old bedroom, where I bend awkwardly for a small, round mirror. I have found an eyelash on my cheek. I dab it with the end of a middle finger, holding it erect for a moment, then close my eyes, and make a wish, to please keep the aircraft in the air today. And blow as on a birthday candle.

I will have to find a new wish now, I am thinking, looking for the eyebrow pencil. Now I have retired from the airline, I could change the make-up routine. Try plum or lilac. I am looking around the dresser for the pencil I was holding a second ago, my annoyance only half drawn on as I look in the drawer of the nightstand.

Has my husband, sitting in front of the television, seen a pencil, I am asking on all fours, looking under the armchair. An eyebrow pencil, brown, about this long. What are you watching. Maybe I took it to one of the other mirrors, I am saying, letting the question trail off into the television’s applause. My husband, who retired from the welfare office a year ago but continues to dress in his office clothes and to rise at seven on weekdays, has fallen asleep in front of the game show, which means it is later than I thought.

When the face is a mess, as we say to juniors, the rest follows, things begin to slip. But a face put together feels no fear or tiredness or anger. Bright smiles hold the plane in the air, I am always saying.

I am looking around the bathroom, on the floor, on and around the sink. But unlike my husband, I do not lose my head when things disappear. I have come to accept that sometimes you are holding something and then it is gone. You are writing a list, you put the pen down and then the pen is gone. No matter how hard you look it is as if the pen had flown away. My husband says I have a talent for making his things disappear. It has become a source of despondence to my husband when I put things away and forget about them, which he says, is the same as deliberately hiding them. It is as if an entity living in our house were slowly moving things out of our reach. One day, my husband says, I will misplace him and it will be like falling through a hole in the world where at least, he says, he will be reunited with the charging cable and his reading glasses, the Blu-Tack and the good pen. But if my husband would let me finish, a while later when you are no longer thinking about pens but looking for the television remote, which has somehow fallen out of existence, it turns out you are actually holding the pen. There, in your other hand, as in a magic trick. And so there is no reason to get angry, I assure my husband, for though the remote is lost, is not the pen regained, and if something must first be lacking, is not everything found that once was lost.

I am looking around the sink in case the pencil decided to reappear when I had my back turned. And then my phone starts ringing. Our eldest daughter is calling as I search for the reading glasses without which I am always stabbing the wrong part of the phone and declining people’s phone calls. Please wait, please hold on, I am saying, as I hurry down the stairs, looking around the catchall, the pockets of my coat, letting my hand fall to my side in mock despair when the ringing stops.

I am standing for a moment in front of the game show where contestants open boxes. Whatishecalled is speaking through a red telephone to an entity who dispenses cash prizes, and because of Jenny from Manchester’s enormous gums, I have forgotten what I was looking for. Still, I am turning over the sofa cushions so that by looking I may remember what was forgotten, maybe under the sofa or somewhere around the room, my hands on my hips, so that no one will say that I wander into rooms forgetting what it was I was doing.

Everyone is praying for Joan from Middlesex who has selected the box in front of Andrew from Cardiff. The number of the box is the same as her son’s birthday and she is holding to her lips a small stuffed tiger that once belonged to him, its ears and stripes worn with fondling.

I am worming my hand under my husband in case he is sitting on whatever it was I was looking for, until finally I take my glasses off, put them on my head and drop my arms in defeat, letting go of whatever it was that was probably nothing, leaving the room with the same assurance I have learned from years of smiling into the distance, even as the oxygen masks are dangling and the duty-free is rolling along the aisles, and clings to me wherever I go, obliging and never complaining, impeccable in every detail, appearing always busy, unperturbed by strange noises and sudden drops in altitude.

As I climb the stairs, I think is it possible that I did not lose anything. As when I leave the house with the feeling that something is missing or forgotten or undone, but after checking all my pockets or turning back find that everything is where it was. Maybe you cannot remember, because no one can remember what they have not forgotten, I am thinking, putting away the suitcase from the France retirement holiday. My husband insists he will put the suitcase away, but it has just been lying on the floor of our bedroom since we got back a week ago, reminding me of this holiday he thoughtfully organised to celebrate my retirement and which I would like now to forget. The whole time he called me Madame, for he knows I love France and everything French. He said I would never pick up another suitcase as long as he lived, but I wish he was less rough with our luggage and with things in general which, he says, are not made of glass, doing a mincing impression of a French homosexual, but was in fact a retirement present from the airline and now the retractable handle is broken and you have to bend down to wheel it in front of you over the quaint but uneven cobbles of Chapeau, causing him to sweat and gasp in front of the French, who never gasp or sweat. I wish my husband would close his mouth when we are on holiday, and not stick his tongue out at the slightest effort. I wish he would stop breathing in front of women on deckchairs, in front of children in swimwear who cannot help watching the spectacle of my husband eating ice cream cones. Still, it is important to me that he performs these gestures, such as carrying the luggage, showing that he thinks of me, and that I continue to exist when I am not in the room.

Before I put the case in the attic I will use it to store the summer clothes and some things I have found in the closet, like the cushion shaped like a fish which admittedly was very funny at the time but now you do not know what to do with, and some lewd souvenirs from Chapeau which my husband thinks are extremely funny and wanted to give to people and which I put away when we came back and we have not been able to find since. I am moving some old video cassettes that we have been keeping in the girls’ bedroom to the suitcase lying on the bed.

I am sitting on the small single bed opposite the bunk beds in our daughters’ bedroom, young men with hair gel and abdominals looking on dreamily as I leaf through some old copybooks from a cardboard box that once contained an under-desk bike exerciser and now is full of all kinds of rubbish, sports-day medals, communion medals, ribbons, CDs, spare memorial cards from our daughter’s funeral, things you do not even know what they are. The orange marker that goes around the skirting boards comes into the room, loops over the window frame, runs up the bunk bed and swirls and expands under the top bunk where it begins or ends, and now leaps on to the copybook where the youngest of the three has done a crude drawing of her father which, you must admit, looks like the male member smiling at you with bird’s wings and flaming orange hair. Our eldest, it must be, has written, I am doing your hair the colour of the holy spirit in quotes and the date.

Hmm, I am thinking, wandering out on to the landing. I am like a coin that has not yet fallen on one side or the other. But then I start moving towards the bathroom, where I catch myself unfinished in the mirror. I had to put my make-up on twice this morning because I cried all over myself like a papier-mâché head left out in the rain and now I am behind on the day.

I almost never cry, never once went on strike. But this morning I called our eldest daughter, whom I am usually careful not to disturb, about something I cannot now remember. Now, as I apply the contours of the nose, heightening the cheekbones, foreshortening the top half of my massive forehead, lining the airline’s stipulated red smile, I am thinking about how I started shaking with tears this morning and had to hold on to the kitchen counter as if to stop myself from falling. I am remembering the long rope of weeping that reached almost to the floor, until by the fourth or fifth ring of the phone I suddenly fell quiet, like a baby that has cried itself out, and whatever it was fell right out of my head and I hung up before our daughter could answer. I am taking the pencil from the edge of the sink to complete the ponderous expression, thinking what it could have been that I forgot. No trace of the storm that carried my face away, only the quiet optimism which you feel on some level is all that is keeping the plane in the air.

Pulling the shopping trolley behind me on the pavement, I wish I did not have to experience the tedium of the walk to the Lidl supermarket. It is mostly pebble-dash, except for the statue of the Virgin which they have had to put behind chicken wire to stop children throwing stones at her. Once you are in the Lidl supermarket it is not too bad but then there is the return which is arguably worse, where you pass the Virgin again, missing her hands and nose, baring her terrifying wire armature, where the plaster has fallen away. Sometimes I wish the shopping could be done as in a montage. Much of life, I feel, should be as in a montage. The effort and tedium edited out, the wheelless, seatless bicycle tied to the lamp post edited out, the young men on bicycles, and the wet mattress clinging to a lamp post edited out, leaving only the nice parts, and maybe some light piano music. Surely they must be working on something like it. How is it that one minute you are on the pavement going to the Lidl supermarket sighing at the eternity of the pebble-dash and then somehow you have returned, and where does the time between the one and the other go. Does it fall out of existence, I am asking my husband as I survey the road between the curtains of the front-room window, or does it remain, not in an actual room, not in a literal room, but somewhere, I am saying, sucking my teeth at the smear on the shoulder of my blouse, where a series of beige chins accumulate. My hand falls with a despondent slap of my thigh at the stain on the fun and different pineapple blouse where I must have caught my face this morning.

I am wetting my finger on the way to the kitchen, wiping urgently at the stain which you must address as soon as possible, like mutinous junior flight staff or an unfamiliar lump. Quick, the fun and different pineapple blouse is new, its jumble of pineapples is very me. Quick, I am thinking, rubbing harder. Wiping the pineapples with some soap, I notice that my husband has pulled sheets out of the Lidl supermarket magazine and laid them in front of the wall where he has started painting over some orange marker. When my husband retired he started seeing orange marker all around the skirting boards of our house. For a second the shadow of what I was crying about opens its arms to me and I try to hold the memory by rubbing harder with the soap and sticking my tongue out a little. Our daughter died a long time ago and you feel it is okay to paint over these things now, to get new appliances even if they have orange marker on them where our dead daughter tried to colour everything in the so-called colour of the holy spirit. I am doing a sad weeping face and thinking of our dead daughter in case that was what it was this morning, but then the kettle grumbles to a boil. I do not remember putting the kettle on but it has a cup next to it with a teabag inside, which I drown in the water. Then I go back to rubbing the blouse with the soap, looking around at the floor in case the tears are there waiting to be cried again. I am trying to remember the first two notes of this memory which is like a song that will not come back or a bird that has flown back out of a window, leaving me in the hallway, thinking, where am I going, until the hot tea I am holding takes me, as though by the hand, into the front room where it is set before my husband.

Andrew who works at an Argos warehouse is weeping and has to be comforted by Jill from Northampton and Noel from Antrim, and eventually, everyone joins in to comfort him, including Joan, the woman with the stuffed toy, because of how guilty Andrew feels about the contents of the box that was randomly assigned to him. I am standing for a moment, hands on my hips, sucking my teeth and shaking my head, then turn to the door and go upstairs where I had started packing.

 

But I must have drifted off. Like when I am reading and pages later I have no idea how I got here, in this woman’s body, sitting on the lid of the toilet, under the open window, eating biscuits as the cars on the motorway rock back and forth in the rain like the sea.

The way I have drawn my eyebrows is as if I were thinking very hard about something, but actually I was gazing into space remembering the restaurant in Chapeau when he insisted on shaking the chef’s hand. He had to congratulate the chef on the food. He got angry because I would not try the mussels. Kept saying how talented the chef was, and I had to try and calm him down. People looking, waiters asking him to stay seated, a fight almost breaking out. It comes back in waves of clenching embarrassment. Then, later, watching him apologise to everyone profusely with a French accent to make them understand, tears in his eyes. My husband is always crying and saying sorry. Before leaving, I went to the bathroom, and when I came out he was doing his magic routine, his expression full of wonder, theirs polite and embarrassed, a napkin folded into a dove perched on his arm and then vanishing.

I am wearing one of the dingier bras and still almost-skin-coloured underpants that sink into rolls of fat like bread dough, thin blue veins scrambling like fireworks and petering out over bristling thighs, painted toes staring back like fat pigs from a nursery rhyme. The biscuits I am eating come from behind the plastic bath panel that my husband has still not sealed to the tub. This is where I hide the biscuits from my husband but I have no memory of pulling out the plastic bath panel or only vaguely, or it was a different time.

I was about to remember what I was doing here, but our eldest daughter is calling again and by the time the glasses are on the end of my nose and I am holding the phone, close at first, then farther away, close and far away, back and forth like this, taking aim with a red fingernail and the tip of my tongue sticking out, our daughter has hung up.

Hmm, I am thinking, trying to match the puzzled expression of the eyebrows with a pursing of the mouth, what is the kettle doing on the floor.

Suddenly, I am remembering to lock the door in case my husband comes in, asking why am I sitting naked on the toilet, eating biscuits and so on in the middle of the afternoon.

But the door is already locked.

My husband and I never lock the door though, I am thinking, eating another biscuit, thinking what was I doing in the upstairs bathroom.

Suddenly my irises widen. My heart flutters. But it turns out to be nothing and I sit back down again, shaking my head at myself and this stupid idea I just had.

Back on the toilet seat, I notice the orange marker again, this time in the grouting. Our four-year-old’s most concerted effort with the marker took place behind the television which we moved to cover it up. This meant adjusting the sofa which we forgot had been covering up another spot that she had been trying to fill in with the holy spirit, but which, it turned out, was roughly the shape of the CD rack, and then when CDs were no longer a thing, became a cheese plant.

I am listening to the vascular throb of the television downstairs, wondering what my husband is watching. Soon it will be time for my programme, and then I realise, with sudden brutal clarity, why it was I came up here. I slap myself on the forehead but when I stand up and examine this new realisation, it turns out to be the first realisation, in all its abject stupidity, for the second time.

Soon it will be time for my favourite programme about a depressed English detective. It is getting cold and dark and quiet in the bathroom and I wish I would stop eating the biscuits which are beginning to turn my stomach. I know it was a stupid idea, but still, I cannot help feeling hopeful about this idea I once considered extremely stupid. I am standing at the mirror, taking the hairbrush from the edge of the sink, and brushing my hair. I am brushing my hair in case that was why I came up here but how, I am thinking, can the brushing account for the kettle or the nudity or the lock on the door or the biscuits. Still, I continue to brush my hair in case it takes a while to take effect.

Our eldest daughter is calling but I just remembered why I locked myself in. You become so accustomed to the shouting and crying and recriminations in this house that it becomes a kind of routine in the middle of which you drift off listening to the hush of the motorway or thinking of Chapeau. Some things you do so many times, I always tell my juniors, you can forget you are doing them. I could work through an entire flight, thinking about something else, or perform the safety demonstration, sometimes thinking nothing at all, and have almost no memory of the flight taking place, or the memory of that flight would be the memory of some earlier flight. So now, I cannot remember the precise details of this argument with my husband, but which has all the signs of many previous arguments and is the only way to explain the lock on the door, which he could easily break through but is held back from for fear of damaging the frame. And though I cannot remember all the particulars of this argument, the whole situation is very distressing, which is why I console myself with the biscuits and keep boiling water to throw on my husband should he attempt to tear through the door’s flimsy locking mechanism.

That is why I cannot answer my phone. There is a lot our eldest daughter does not know about her father that her mother keeps behind closed doors. Soon my husband will come out of the front room and call my name from the bottom of the stairs. I will refuse to come out of the bathroom, and may well have to leave my husband for good this time. After a minute or so he will lose patience and go back to the television. Then he will rise from the sofa with something that has occurred to him, stirring things up again, and so on, until, at the end of a long silence, the stairs will ache under my husband’s weight. I will refuse to open the door and will not believe any of my husband’s words which are empty. What has pushed me to the edge this time and so many times is how routine the whole thing has become. The routine has changed and adapted in minor ways just as the in-flight safety demonstration changes and adapts, but always it is the same argument in essence, just as the planes are always largely the same. My voice then will crack with weeping, screaming at him to not come any closer and so on, I have boiling water and so forth. I cannot do it any more, for the last time I cannot do it.

It will not be long now, I am thinking, following the television for the time. My husband will let himself slide to the foot of the door, whispering there, as if our daughters were still here to listen. Who are you whispering for, I sometimes shout angrily. One minute my husband is shouting, the next minute he is whispering. But for whom, I ask, screaming. Then after a long silence it will be his turn to start crying, saying over and over again how sorry he is. My husband never used to cry when the children were around. Not until they were gone did he start crying, wearing you down until you drift off and eventually have no choice but to let him in.

It will not be long now, I am thinking. Because I am in love with France and everything French, my husband always made crêpes for our daughters after our fights, sometimes bringing a plate under the stairs where the two youngest would hide from the screaming. After the girls were gone, it was the only way we knew to bring things to a close and I am always careful to have ingredients, in case of an argument, always the same or more or less the same argument, usually on a Sunday, the only chance work ever afforded. I am not looking forward to the screaming, which is always exhausting, yet even now I cannot help smiling at the thought of the crêpes and the mystery of a dead body showing up next to a lake in Devon or somewhere. Eventually, I will unlock the door and sit back on the floor, eyes turned away from my husband, who, after a pause, will slide over to me, rest his head in my lap and cry as we listen to the lullaby of the motorway. I will stroke his hair until he goes quiet and later give him the rest of the biscuits, usually two-thirds to three-quarters, letting what is said pass into silence.

My husband thinks I will not notice that there are fewer biscuits behind the bath panel. He thinks I will not miss one or two, sometimes three or even four biscuits, which he sneaks out of the bathroom. He thinks I do not know he has found the hiding place, but I have always known. Imagine, I am thinking, how rapidly our marriage would have dissolved without the biscuits and ingredients for the crêpes, and if I let my husband do the shopping, what surreal assortment my husband would come home with if he was allowed to go to the supermarket. It is pointless sulking if there are fewer biscuits than usual. He should have taken less time to make things up to me, and in the first place, he should not be eating biscuits. I am shaking my head at my husband who thinks that by going unnamed, by remaining unspoken, the biscuits will not affect his diabetes. It is because of the diabetes that I must hide the biscuits, which, officially, are reserved for me, and are meant to be a secret, and, therefore, do not, strictly speaking, exist.

Pff, I am thinking, in the soft pink dusk of the bathroom, the water in the kettle could not burn anyone any more. What is going on in the mind of my husband. He does not call my name so I can shout back at him to leave me alone, to not come in here, and so on. I am worrying now about what he will say about all the biscuits I have eaten, even though he is the one who should have come to the door sooner, broken down in tears so we could move on. But instead I must eat my husband’s biscuits which I do not even enjoy.

My phone lights the bathroom like a tea light in a church and goes dark again. A smile is forming on my lips even as I am sucking my teeth, for though it is always the same excuses, the same promises and twisting of words, I am looking forward to leaving the bathroom. But then it turns out to just be our daughter and my heart falls out of the sky.

Is it possible he is acting as if nothing happened, as if I had just been attending to the ordinary concerns of the bathroom, brushing the toilet bowl, changing the dried flowers in the ornamental dish, watching the television as if he had no idea of an argument, what do you mean, love, what did I do, what the hell are you talking about.

I am screaming. Usually, I would also be crying, but it is hard to get the tears going when you do not remember what caused them. The vein in the side of my head is swelling and throbbing, though I am held back by a kind of self-awareness and my heart is not really in it. The room itself swells and throbs with shouting, until there is no air left in my lungs, only a faint fading ring as the bathroom falls quiet again.

My husband knows it is Sunday and that my programme will be on soon yet he will not take responsibility. He does not care that I am in the bathroom screaming and, as far as he knows, also weeping. My husband, with whom I only stayed because of the children, is finally driving me to leave him forever. Now that our children have gone, each in their separate ways, finally, it is time to think about myself. Finally, I will pack a suitcase and I will leave forever, I have decided. It is the only way to put down the biscuits and get out of the bathroom, to get as far away as I can from my husband.

I am making sure to leave everything as it was before I came in, closing the window, pushing the plastic bath panel back into the tub with all of the weight of the years. The weight of the years makes a lot of noise scraping the floor tiles and I have to kick it into place a couple of times. Though in some ways it is true that I have not been crying, I wipe the make-up away from my face with the backs of my hands. I am emptying the kettle into the toilet and washing my face in the sink, rubbing it until it is red and swollen and ugly. Sighing for courage, I take a square of paper, drop it in the toilet and press the bigger of the two flushes.

I am standing, broken, in the doorway of our bedroom, for the last time. After forty years of trying, I am finally leaving my husband once and for all, just as our eldest daughter always said I should have but which I could not for one reason or another. Sometimes I think our daughter failed to leave her husband because of my failure to leave mine. The suitcase is waiting on the bed, where I started packing earlier but was probably stopped by my husband. Probably it is getting a bit cold for the dresses and flip-flops, I am thinking, I do not know what use I will have for a cushion shaped like a fish that beats its tail when there are batteries. Maybe to raise my spirits on dark days, I remember. That is why I have taken the children’s old copybooks. The dresses, the fun and different pineapple blouse, and my passion for France, express who I am deep, deep down, far, far in.

I am slowly descending the stairs with the kettle and the suitcase and all of the years living with my husband. My steps are heavy and I am holding the bannisters as if weak with the years and the weeping. For though I am broken, I have not forgotten what my husband has done which at present I cannot quite remember. I am looking between the hinges of the sitting-room door, where I can see him pretending to sleep. I should have held my breath on tiptoe, I am thinking. Then I would have caught him watching, smiling at the television and moving back into position the way children do when you come back in the room. But I gave him too much warning, and now I will have to leave my husband for good this time.

My phone is ringing but I will be speaking to our daughter later when I need to find a place to stay. It will only be a couple of nights. I do not want to trouble our daughter, whose house is cold and dimly lit, you always feel you are in her way, and by then things will have sorted themselves out with my husband, who is not nearly as bad as our daughter likes to paint him.

But what was I saying. I am taking flour from the cupboard and eggs and milk from the fridge. I cannot remember when I first started taking boiling water upstairs, I am thinking, looking up at the time. Probably it dates back to when I did not know my husband as well as I know him today, like a safety protocol you have to point out for legal reasons but which no one really takes seriously any more. I am sifting the flour for my husband, making a little well at the bottom of the mixing bowl, to save us both some time. Pff, I am thinking, probably our daughter will take it as another reason to blame everything on her father. You cannot tell your daughter anything about her father without her telling you to leave your husband who has worked hard and has earned a break from her constant relitigation of the past. Our eldest daughter has an opinion on everything and uses these so-called thoughts as ways to not think about her own failures, her own husbands and children. I am heating the pan, looking up at the time. Children have their own individual characters, which you cannot set at the feet of their parents. Our daughter will see that eventually some of her children will move to Florida, some will die, while others will always be crying and complaining and relitigating. There is nothing you can do about these things, I want to tell our daughter.

I have made my husband’s crêpes and we are watching my programme about English people winding up dead in enviable homes. There is lots of exposed stone and wisteria in this one and the investigator is particularly ambivalent about his job. His house, you can tell from his clothes and manner, is not as nice as the deceased’s.

Every so often I tap my husband, asking is that not Whatishecalled, who plays the Youknowwhat, I am whispering behind the screen of my hand, in Thesomething, which my husband always confuses with Theotherone.

I am withdrawing my hand from my husband, who pretends to be asleep because of something I must have said in the past which I cannot remember but which in its context was probably justified, and so I move to the other armrest. Maybe I will remind my husband that he snores but we are no longer speaking. At least now you can follow what is going on without a running commentary from my husband, even if what is going on is not as good as you remember.

I am drawing the curtains of the front room. I am taking my plate to the kitchen where I accidentally break wind, which I worry will make me sound cheerful instead of angry for the things my husband has said, which were far worse than anything I said. I am standing for a moment in the doorway, watching my husband in case I catch him smiling or taking a biscuit. He is not moving now but you can tell he was just a moment before, like junior flight staff going quiet when senior flight staff enter a room. Please turn the television off at the wall when you come to bed, I am asking politely.

I was going to unpack the suitcase after the crêpes, but now I will have to leave it in front of the bedroom so I am ready to leave him first thing in the morning. It is too late to leave my husband today and I have not spoken to our daughter about arrangements yet.

I am turning on to my side, away from his half of the bed, as close as I can to my edge without falling off, and letting one out. I have rolled myself in the duvet so he will not have any. I do not want him to touch me. I am closing my eyes, floating on tides of murmured television washing back and forth through the door, wondering in the warm vascular darkness what must I have said for him not to speak to me. I do not want to stay at our daughter’s house, whose dog’s name and gender you are always supposedly getting wrong. Admittedly, it is not unusual for one of us to take it this far, though packing a suitcase is usually enough to end it. Once I took it a step further and, after packing my bag, said goodbye to the children, lying that I had to go back to work, and the two youngest wept and hung on to my ankles and I parked on the other side of the block for a few hours, eating chocolate from an expired advent calendar. I did the shopping and, after a probationary silence, he made crêpes and the two youngest came out of their hiding places. The four-year-old wet with tears and my husband making the dove disappear.

And when I open my eyes, the sun is wincing in the curtains. My husband is up. His pillow cold to the touch, his half of the mattress empty, and the television already on. I am hoping he will not try to talk to me. He forgets that mornings are like jet lag for me, and then he complains that he told me something and that I forgot, even though I told him. I told him I am not there in the mornings.

I am dead weight. I lower myself down the stairs, one step at a time, shuffle to and fro in the kitchen until the water has boiled and lean against the counter, zoning out at a nest of orange marker I am noticing on the refrigerator, unspooling itself around the skirting boards and on to the dial of the washing machine. Since retiring I have started noticing things, primarily in the mornings, like the three freckles on the back of my husband’s ear which I swear were not there before. We had to move the fridge around to hide our four-year-old’s attempt to fill in this blank that resides in things. I am going to pour hot water from the kettle into a mug but I am already holding a mug, hot and beige and burning my lips.

I am putting my make-up on though I thought I remembered doing it already. I am putting the clothes from the suitcase back into the dresser, reminding myself to find something with which to take them to the attic, leaving the suitcase next to the bed for my husband to put away. I am not sure what I was doing in the front room but there is always something you can be getting on with while you remember so I am dusting the picture frames on the mantelpiece and around the retirement card which reads Bonne Voyage. I cannot help smiling at this as I dust, and at the kind words of my former colleagues, who I thought did not like me but perhaps just thought I was being French. People at work somehow got it in their heads that I liked France, and would use French phrases with me. I have no idea where they got this or who they could have mistaken me for. Friends and relatives also started working under this assumption, I remember, burning my lips, gazing out the front-room window. And eventually, my husband followed. I was always missing Christmas but I would come home to a lot of French-themed gifts and it seemed impolite to say anything, and eventually, it became a part of who I am, like the fun and different pineapple blouse, which it is true has something French about it. Sometimes I think I have gotten tired of France, tired of all the French-themed decor in our home, but actually it is that I never liked France. It is easy to forget that I have never cared much for the French.

What are you watching, I am asking my husband, who has fallen asleep in front of the antiques programme. Is it the antiques you are watching.

I am thinking we should get a new refrigerator, I am telling my husband, the old one works but probably it is time to get rid of it now.

My husband is wearing black leather shoes, a blue chequered short-sleeved shirt, grey flannel trousers open at the fly that bunch three centimetres down from the belt buckle. His head is cocked back, his mouth open, showing its glistening pinks, off-whites and reds. His tie is open and some of the buttons of his shirt have popped off showing some of his chest. One of your shoelaces is loose, I am saying, sucking my teeth, except that there is a knot where you can see he lost his patience and started pulling like a maniac. I am kneeling by my husband’s shoe, trying to undo the knot but it is no use. I feel like crying at this knot in my husband’s shoelace.

I am turning off the television. I am putting the television remote in my husband’s shirt pocket as a joke about me always disappearing the television remote. I am caressing his thin, white hair and putting a throw over his knees, tucking him in, kissing him on the head.

I am standing, thinking what I will do next. I am opening the window to let the stale air out. Our daughter is calling but I cannot answer, unfortunately, due to the hoover, which is almost completely drowning out the ringing. I am not as careful with the hoover attachment around my husband’s feet as I am around the furniture. Sorry, I am saying to my husband when it hits his foot. And again a second time.

I am catching my face in the glass of the picture frames. I have not done a great job of the eyebrows today, I am thinking, which look startled as if by something coming this way. I cannot always explain the placement of my eyebrows from one day to the next.

I am looking out at the road from the front window. I dreamed, I am telling my husband, I was flying, but the controls were written in French. Anyway, I am saying, flinching at the tea, though it is basically cold, flinching as I suck it in, as if it was burning hot, and scowl at the road from the heat of the tea. A sudden downpour of children’s voices, screaming, school shoes smacking the pavement, a flash of coats and school bags, and the dead silence they leave behind them, like litter.

I am crouching under the window of the sitting room to avoid detection by our eldest daughter. Now and then you can hear the flimsy, metallic letter flap clearing its throat, her voice alternating with her daughter’s and her husband’s, Whatishecalled. No, not Whatishecalled, that is what we called the first one. Thenewone. Eventually, a key starts turning in the lock.

Our daughter is giving me a hug, then our granddaughter, whose name I am supposedly always getting confused with my youngest daughter, and I smile affably at Thenewone who says Bonjour. Our daughter is asking me something but I hold a finger to my lips, gesturing to our granddaughter that my husband is sleeping in the front room. Our daughter is asking how I am and I take the coats. She tried calling a few times but I have to strain to hear what she is saying, cupping my ear, and she is speaking so low that I simply agree, smiling at Whatishecalled, Thenewone, who is quite handsome and likes to say things in French to me. France is my thing. I am winking at him and make a drinking-tea-from-a-cup gesture while orienting us to the kitchen.

I am explaining to Thenewone about the parking disc as the tea brews, and to be careful of his tyres. Watch your tyres do not get stabbed, I am telling him, with a stabbing motion. Our daughter says I called her yesterday morning and she was worried because I was not answering the phone, but I do not have any parking discs, I am sorry to tell our daughter’s husband whom I am careful not to name in case I confuse him with the first husband, Whatwashecalled. I am offering him one of the biscuits my husband did not finish last night. I am showing our granddaughter the card I got from work. Not everyone makes it to the end, I am telling her. One colleague, years back, I am saying, laughing, after years in the company started panicking during the safety demonstration that there was nothing under our feet, and began struggling to breathe, shaking with tears and holding on to a bit of panelling as if she might fall. Haha, I am saying. She was never able to fly after that, I am laughing. Not once did I go on strike, I am telling our granddaughter. My girls always hit their targets. Where is our daughter, I am asking Thenewone, getting our daughter’s name confused with our other daughters and then my sister and my mother until finally, I get the right one. Please, I am telling him, with a hand on his arm, do not leave valuables visible in the car. I am winking and smiling at him, nodding at something he is saying, and start pouring milk, remembering how once when I came home from work our four-year-old managed to kill herself with a Lidl shopping bag. This was especially depressing as people did not really go to Lidl at the time. People forget that it was embarrassing to be seen at Lidl, to have German-labelled gherkins or biscuits, as this meant you were poor and shopped from bins, as we used to say. Their biscuits are very good though. My husband, who you know, I am saying to Thenewone, had to break down the door of the bathroom and when he got in the room was empty, as if the four-year-old had flown away. There and then not there, created and uncreated. Actually she was at the foot of the house outside, I am saying, shaking my head disapprovingly. The bag was tied to a string, I am saying, tied under her armpits in a sort of parachute. Now it is perfectly acceptable to shop in Lidl. Everyone does. I am trying to think of something else to say to our daughter’s husband in the front room where his wife is having some kind of meltdown. Still, I am saying, I find the bags a bit depressing so I usually bring a shopping trolley.

 

For a second I was worried I had forgotten the purse I usually take for the shopping, its weight missing from my left coat pocket, but actually this is normal as I am standing next to a coffin laid on a pair of trestles in an alley of the cemetery, with our daughter, and Thenewone and their daughter and others. I am beginning to notice a certain pattern with our children. Though we have three daughters, it is always the same daughter I have the least to say to who is always calling or linking arms with me, looking mournfully at me, or rubbing my back. Our daughter in Florida is sorry she could not make it, because of the dogs, which you have to say is fair enough, but sent a wreath. How true to life that the daughter I have the most in common with, the one I have the most to say to and would welcome a phone call from at any time, is the one who jumped out the bathroom window. And the daughter I have the second most in common with, who feels like an old friend you have drifted away from but still welcome a catch up with from time to time, at least is not dead, but still is very far away, has children who sound American, and almost never calls. And that finally, the daughter I have nothing to say to, the one who has nothing but the most trivial, empty things to say because she never travels and just stays on her estate, a couple of estates from here where they have exactly the same things happening, is, contrary to the first two, always calling me, and calling round to our house, and at the most inopportune times, when I am holding more things than I have hands or when I am trying to remember something perching its weightless anxious body on my shoulder and that the slightest movement will scare away. She scares it away.

The man in charge of the ceremony is wearing a black suit and white shirt and asks if anyone would like to say a word. He makes you feel awkward, this man, that you did not dress better for the occasion, or are not sad enough and do not have poignant words to say. At least he is not a priest, I am thinking. You have to say, looking at this man, that the country has come far. There is some awkward looking around at our feet, some holding of breath, clenching of jaws. A cousin of my husband is about to say something but closes his mouth again when the man moves on to the next bit. I want to laugh at my husband’s cousin, who as soon as he opens his mouth someone else is talking over him. The officiant is unfolding a sheet of paper from his trouser pocket and begins to read a poem. You have to wonder what else is in that pocket and what else that hand was holding today. A bus lurches past and I am wondering what number. I am standing the way people do, waiting for their luggage to come around. Our daughter keeps sniffling. I wish she would blow her nose but I do not want her to start relitigating the past.

Finally, the young men who were hanging around in a corner somewhere hurry solemn expressions back on to their faces and mount the coffin on to their shoulders. They too make you feel underdressed. There is a moment where the coffin looks like it might slip but coffins never slip. One of them has a stud in his ear. He is probably thinking about sex, I am thinking. My husband’s cousin tries to rub my back but my daughter gets there first and he has to make it look natural as we look into the carpeted rectangle in the earth. Then, all of a sudden, I feel light with panic, as if I was falling or made of paper. I am digging around my pocket for the keys to the house, which are in the left pocket where I keep them. Then I think that I have lost my phone but it is in the right pocket. Our daughter, who is crying, is looking at me as if to ask what is it, and I am thinking that I have lost it, lost it forever, but then I remember that I am holding it, the umbrella, and wave her away.

    "text": "Betty 

    I walked past, not young, old elm trees that should have dignity.
    
    That was one little flash of something that nearly meant something to me.
    
    I was off to see Betty, but our ten o’clock plan was not realized.
    
    I am very ashamed of myself for how long I have waited for Betty, considering that such waiting can result in confused thinking and irritability.
    
    ‘She’ll be down,’ I was told. ‘Do you want anything to drink?’
    
    It tasted so good. The coffee I was served might as well have been cocoa.
    
    Once, weeks previously, Betty had spoken to me from her stair landing. It was as if she were presenting an important address from a balcony! – with her hands gripping the banister, and that may have helped me.
    
    I want an outlook on life, a plan for my life. I want to feel like an excited dog.
    
    I heard today what sounded like a dog’s tail being stepped on, coming from her kitchen, while waiting – also, the doorbell – and two boys dropped off a plate of cookies for Betty, iced with slapdashed-thick-white frosting.
    
    And I said, ‘She won’t like those.’
    
    The boys were dressed identically, but one’s face was happy and the other’s sad. I could say one face was ecstatic. I could say nothing.
    
    But I say this in closing – today I waited for Betty for over an hour and a half, or two hours, and was not sent away.
    
    A very little bit of Betty goes a long way, not unlike how the limbs of the ancient elms kink and then reach.
    
    As I left her premises, there were so many birds flying at such speeds. Gulls.
    
    Some were bumping into each other. They were overreacting to the wind – or just impulsively motivated or were they displaying agitation about a new project? – the sort of zeal I am always in need of.
    
    Or were they showing appetite for one another – I am going to getch choo! I’m going to getch choo!
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
    Oh, to Be Able to Inspire Sex Love
    
    I was laughing the orgy off later. I had been curious enough. I was not then who I am now.
    
    Maybe I went with somebody I knew, not very well – Lisa.
    
    Hopefulness combined with bravery had gotten me to that place – a whole history could be written.
    
    Two jumbo, gatekeeper-type porcelain lions stood at the entry when we arrived. Their legs, tails, paws and faces were painted blue. Their blue tails were curled over their backs.
    
    There was a problem with the clothing – it was in a heap somewhere – my clothing, along with my money, and I knew I could not get at it when the lights went out.
    
    I felt breath on the top of my head as someone dislodged himself, as people left the front room to find bedrooms.
    
    I had not been invited and the only thing for me was this carpet, so I pulled it up – an edge – and it was dusty, and I was sweeping with my hand to get pieces of things out that were further in, and then I crawled under and fell asleep.
    
    In that era, when I was a traveler, I found environments not very different from my own, where large numbers of people participate in festivals in the richest nation of the world; exclusive groups.
    
    Please honor us with your presence – christenings, communions, weddings and surprise parties.
    
    I still follow the trails of my friends – locating their camps and their ceremonies – first saying thanks to my father and to my mother for this day, before I go out most prayerfully, seductively.
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
    Fully Forward and Down 
    
    I got in behind him on the kitchen chair – as if we could share a ride on a motorbike – not nearly enough room.
    
    That’s Gideon. Silent and somber. My arms were around his front.
    
    Back into my own proper place quickly – to take a drink of water. I aimed my full glass at and above my open mouth – and then poured, as if I had mistaken my glass for a pitcher. Not on purpose . . .
    
    I had to mop myself.
    
    After that I went out onto our porticoed porch and down the few stairs – where a stargazer I had planted appeared to notice me.
    
    The bend in the road I followed led to the house with shutters that are commonplace, as are the clapboards and one wraparound veranda.
    
    I try but cannot describe such sights in a particular way – the old-style houses that should brace and inform me, if they only would!
    
    In the evening, does it matter when? – I was so often doing this – I was rubbing a dinner serving bowl with a soapy brush and conducting the marital conversation: Na-ah. Ah. It’s all right, and I don’t know – said three times.
    
    I grew up in an old stone house with a walled garden to the rear. I often climbed the wall, and that was never easy, and I sat on it.
    
    There was not much more I could do with the wall.
    
    I did kick at it with my heels, the memorable chance to feel cruel, to hurt myself too.
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
    Me, Breathing Hard
    
    Afterward, the man, who appeared confident, was looking and looking, but not at me – the man who added a flurry to the mix of the objects all around us, out of which his head and face seemed to pop.
    
    I had a stomachache, but had consented to intercourse, because I did jump at every chance – with him.
    
    But none of this is controversial – nor had been the man’s modest request.
    
    Then I was downstairs at the point of leaving Hank Hardy forever, because he had decreed it.
    
    It is worth noting that at that time I had the same teakettle that Hank had (not on purpose). Not on purpose – I owned the very same carpet that Hank had – small enough to be used in any part of the house! The background was gold.
    
     
    
    *
    
     
    
    So even after decades have passed, I find that I thoroughly ache for Hank, and I would love to see Hank’s face as he now appears with old age creeping in on him.
    
    What I look like now . . . heavy eyelids dominate my face and I am as near as may be to slightly rotund.
    
     
    
    *
    
     
    
    Out on an errand, I walked close enough to an elderly couple to overhear the woman say, ‘What can I do with them?’
    
    ‘Do all you can do,’ the man replied, ‘if it’s not too much trouble.’
    
    The woman slumped against the traffic-light post, holding on to it tightly.
    
    When the light turned green, the man continued on without her, so I offered her my arm, as she was still latched to the post. She is frail.
    
    I might as well say this was Ann Lenihan and her husband. They’re my neighbors.
    
    And while we both dealt with the difficulty that the uphill sidewalk presented, a hulk of a woman swung by us.
    
    A toddler, seeming to be on his own – was many paces behind this person I took to be the child’s mother.
    
    He was hauling a backpack that caused him to hunch like an old man, although he’d been outfitted like a teen with shades on, with a visored cap. A sort of beast of burden, or a beast of a burden likely.
    
     
    
    *
    
     
    
    Today I managed to waylay a robin by whistling in a manner that a robin might take to be bona fide – because I was careful to repeat the phrase with no alteration.
    
    I sounded a bright note up, a bright note down, and followed those with a rolling sound – over and over again. How many times do you kiss? – pet somebody? – fuck . . .
    
    The bird chirruped and remained rooted to the ground – did not tire of me, because I had successfully wooed him.
    
    Then I flagged, I quit, I left – all of which counts, suffice it to say, for something."

    "text": "Hunter was hot but she made me feel stupid.

    It was my fault, not hers. She was patient with me. We’d been dating for three months and the stupid feeling still hadn’t gone away, not even when we kissed, not even when she looked at me under a streetlamp and said with her hands on my hips, You’re an angel from God. I didn’t know what to say so I just looked at her, her skin tinged green by a nearby exit sign. We stood there, weirdly quiet, until she touched me on the forehead and murmured, Knock knock, and I said, automatic, Who’s there?
    
    I felt stupid when she told me she’d started working at a massage parlor and without thinking I said, How come you never practice on me? We were drinking at a tiki bar and her group of friends burst out laughing, then covered their mouths.
    
    Being around Hunter’s friends only made me feel stupider. Their lives seemed so robust, urbane, full of rotating love affairs and semi-legal gig work. When they spoke, it was like they were handing out business cards – this is me, here are the things that I’m good at, that get me hot, that piss me off. They chain-smoked but had perfect skin or else the wrinkles suited them, made them look cowboy-esque. They were never home and yet their apartments were full of tropical plants that flourished in their absence. They wore complicated rompers to the gym and dirty T-shirts to parties. I suppose they were nice to me, in their own way. They recommended things for me to try – the soup dumplings from that place on Clement, EMDR, bangs.
    
    It didn’t help that Hunter had told them I’d never dated a woman before. As a group their understanding made me squirm, their soft-focus waterproof eyes. I didn’t know how to explain myself. I practiced, sometimes, in the bathroom mirror: I don’t like labels, I’m from bumfuck Nevada, I’ve never had a boyfriend either . . . but everything reeked of cliché so I just said nothing, mute in my seat, while Hunter and her friends spoke about movies that I’d never seen and who was fucking who.
    
     
    
    When I asked Hunter to explain, her voice was serene. Surely you’ve heard of a happy ending massage? She was eating leftover noodles, standing in her bedroom with one sock on, the other foot bare. Nothing seemed to make her shy; she never doubted the world’s ability to accommodate her and her shapeshifting desires. I was just another casualty to her old-world bravado, to the way she wore her jacket over her shoulders with her long arms bare, to the way she called everyone baby. She had a way of making you feel chosen when she touched you on the inner wrist, like some porno nurse taking your pulse – there, there. Her friend Ducky once told her, If you hadn’t turned out gay as fuck, you would totally be evil, to which they both cackled. Kept afloat by a trust fund, she was always into something new: noise music, numerology, performance art. There was the winter of mime, the self-imposed stick-and-pokes zigzagging her thigh. She spent hours every day in her studio, from which I was barred. That month, a blue June, her thing was collage. The floor of her apartment was covered in thrashed fashion magazines and bottles of Elmer’s glue I liked to sniff when she wasn’t around; the back-to-school smell made me nostalgic.
    
    Of course, I said. You mean those skeezy places where dudes go to get off ? I sat on her bed and picked up a magazine, a weather-beaten Vogue; as I pretended to study it, I saw that each page had a woman-shaped hole in it. This made me uneasy, like I was a rookie detective in a cop show and I’d found something damning.
    
    Sure, Hunter said. That’s the gist of it. Genevieve told me about this place downtown, Angel Palace Spa, they’ll hire anyone with tits. I’ve been craving more structure in my life, as you know, so I picked up some daytime shifts.
    
    And you like it?
    
    She smiled, cilantro in her teeth. I do.
    
    What else was there to say? She wound her arms around my neck. There was chili oil under her nails and it made my eyes sting. We took off our clothes and slid into bed, a California king she’d pushed up against the window so that I sometimes dreamed of suicide. She had a squishy white duvet I associated with privilege, as if coziness was something, like table manners or French, she’d been taught as a child by some lanky au pair. Meanwhile I rented a room in the Sunset from two dental students who dabbled in kink; on weekends they hosted sex parties and their friends would arrive in cop uniforms while they themselves wore their actual dental scrubs. Sometimes I heard a drill from behind their closed bedroom door. More perversely, they boiled three dozen eggs every Sunday night without fail. For this reason Hunter and I spent most nights at her apartment in Russian Hill, having sex on her oh-so-breathable sheets.
    
    As we lay down, I could sense that we would never talk about this again. It would be neatly off-limits, like how her family made money (they were tied up in oil and guns) or the fact that she liked me for being a little bit broken. The last thing I could think to ask was, What days do you work?
    
    Tuesdays, ten to three, she said, her voice thick with sleep. Like every mega-babe I’d ever known, she slept with a stuffed animal, in her case a gnarled hippo named Boom Boom. They said I have the makings of a top earner.
    
    I scratched her scalp the way she liked. She had recently shaved her head and we were still finding shreds of hair everywhere. With her golden curls and puffy lips, she’d looked the part of an angel; now, freshly buzzed, she was angular, troubling. She got even more attention from men in the street. Oh, I whispered. Good for you.
    
     
    
    Four days later she was leaving. Her college roommate Zero was getting top surgery and would be convalescing in his family’s Nantucket beach house; Hunter had volunteered to fly out, drain his tubes, wrangle the Roku, and reminisce on the past.
    
    He won’t be able to lift his arms or walk the dogs, she explained, throwing clothes in a duffel bag. He needs me right now. I wondered why she was packing bikinis if the plan was to putter around a dank, smelly room. I tried to picture Zero: muscular forearms, a wide-ranging knowledge of queer literature. I fought the urge to ask if they’d fucked. I didn’t want to hear her airy proclamation, Of course! But that was, like, a million years ago. Who even were we? Instead I said, I’ll miss you.
    
    She pulled me in for a kiss; her lips tasted of Emergen-C. I’ll miss you too, Laney. Really, I will. She put Boom Boom in her bag. Will you hold down the fort while I’m gone? Water my plants, stay out of trouble?
    
    I nodded, trying not to laugh; what trouble was there without her? I’d been in San Francisco for all of four months. Before Hunter and I matched on a dating app, I’d spent my nights alone. I lay in the bath and read my textbooks front to back, until my fingers went pruney and the dental students banged on the door. Some of us need TO GO #2! I’d moved to California to finish my degree, but really, the desert no longer suited me. In college I studied engineering but I stopped going the spring semester of my junior year. I floated around for a while, then found work as a receptionist at a Reno hotel called The Nugget. I liked the thirty-minute drive into Reno, when the desert was still purple, hushed; I liked the little black dresses they made us wear, bland enough to fit anyone’s fantasy.
    
    It was there that I first kissed a girl, in a double room full of cigarette smoke, while her boyfriend sat on the opposite bed and filmed us with his phone. That was the rule: he had to stay on his bed, us on ours. I remember how the cheap green bedspread crumpled under my ass, how the girl spilled her Tecate on the bed and it just slid right off, like an oil slick. I’d first seen the couple by the pool on my lunch break; the next evening, they came looking for me at the front desk. The woman wore a snakeskin bikini both times, giving me the impression that she never took it off. You might call this my wild era, a smeary year of sleeping with people I met at The Nugget. I marked the third anniversary of my sister’s death by fucking a traveling salesman who specialized in robotic vacuums. It’s the future, he promised, the future is here. Every day after work I changed into the clothes I kept in the trunk of my car and permitted myself one martini at the hotel bar. If someone fuckable didn’t materialize by the time I finished my drink, I went home.
    
    I never told Hunter about this. My encounters felt seedy compared to her tangled summer romances, her exacting terminology – polycule, edge play, stone. Her love life was a novel while mine was a pamphlet handed out by Jesus freaks (repent!!). Sometimes Hunter’s preoccupation with love made her seem worldly and sometimes it made her seem babyish, a little girl looking around her birthday party and wondering, who will pick me up next? She didn’t know who she was if she wasn’t in love, like the boys in my engineering classes who wept when they got a B+ or the veterans at The Nugget who guarded their favorite slot machines – we each sought something God-shaped to define us. I thought of the career-assessment tests I’d taken as a senior in high school, administered by a woman in butt-toning sneakers. The tests were supposed to lay bare our passions and aptitudes. My results were inconclusive; I’d gotten stoned during lunch and decided to bubble my answers in the shape of a heart.
    
    The proctor had squinted at my test for a long, long time. Does the letter S mean something to you? she said finally. I’m getting a name that starts with S. I stared at her, horrified; my sister’s death was still fresh. I moonlight as a psychic on the strip, she explained with a devilish smile.
    
    Whatever, I said, then cut class for the rest of the day, driving in circles with my AC on high.
    
    I’ll be good, I said into Hunter’s deliciously unwashed hair. Don’t have too much fun without me. Then I shouldered her bags and walked her outside, where the taxi was already waiting.
    
     
    
    It was nice to be on my own at first. I watered Hunter’s ferns, I slept in her bed, I did my shitty data entry job from the tub. I took a long walk every afternoon and concocted baroque stir-fries using things I found in her pantry. On the third day I made blondies, thinking of her. I opened a kitchen drawer and found an official-looking form amid rubber bands and takeout menus. It was a list of rules, xeroxed on pale pink paper; on the back of it, the name JULIET had been scribbled. I read it in the kitchen, letting the oven warm my hip –
    
    Who are the ANGELS, you ask? ANGELS bring pleasure & relief to our discerning customers. ANGELS provide an important service to the men who visit us. Our clean & discreet Spa is a temple for many, located at 666 Stockton, open 24/7

    Congratulations! You are now an ANGEL in our clean & private Palace Spa. Please show up to your shift in a WHITE dress or skirt, spaghetti straps OK. Please note: we keep the Palace at a comfortable 72 degrees so long sleeves are not necessary.
    
    I turned off the oven, forsaking my blondies.
    
    From then on the Palace was all I could think about. It followed me like a ghost, like BO. When Hunter texted me selfies from Zero’s guest bedroom, I texted back: missing you!! I didn’t let her in on my turmoil. But every walk I took brought me closer and closer to that side of town until one afternoon, a week after Hunter had left for Nantucket, I went out for some air and found myself at 666 Stockton.
    
    It was the last building on the block, next to the mouth of a smoggy tunnel. A handwritten sign had been taped to the pale pink door – a touch of ecstasy? 3rd flr. I rang the bell and the grate buzzed open; I stepped into a small, dark lobby. The floor was covered in junk mail. I read the fake-sounding names of the other businesses on their mail slots: Life Options Inc., Favorite Models & Talent, Forevermore Financial. There was no elevator, just an empty shaft with a chair placed in front of it and another handwritten sign that said broken!!!!, so I took the stairs. I didn’t have a plan; I felt swimmy and blank, like when I drank after work at The Nugget and emptied my mind, wearing a tank top that still smelled of cum because I didn’t see the point in washing something that would be dirtied again and again. I would sit at the bar and become a vessel, a whistle, a ceramic dog on a shelf – useless until used.
    
    I reached the third floor and entered a room, high-ceilinged and airy. It was furnished by neutral-hued beanbags and white shag rugs. White plastic roses had been strung vertically from the ceiling, causing me to stoop. Along the far wall was a series of closed doors, each labeled with a plaque: love angel, touch angel, my angel, go angel. It smelled of baby powder and expensive shampoo. A horde of tan, leggy girls lounged about, clad in white tube tops, knee-socks, tennis skirts, scrunchies, gossiping crisscross-applesauce. One girl sat by the window, blanched by the late-afternoon light, knitting a baby hat in a white microkini. I felt like I’d walked into a casting call for a Xanax commercial and/or a porno so softcore as to be holy. A limby older woman with long blonde hair sat on an exercise ball behind a desk, writing in a diary with an actual lock. She beamed at me as I entered. Welcome! she called in a clipped Slavic accent. She wore the key to the diary on a chain around her neck. How can I help you, my love?
    
    Oh . . . I glanced around; the girls had formed a chorus line in the center of the room. I felt lurid as a stop sign in my dirty pink sweatpants, unsure of what I wanted or why I had come. I was j-just wondering . . . if y’all are still hiring. I wiped my palms on my ass. My friend Juliet referred me.
    
    Oh! The woman clutched her throat. She wore a loose white slip that gave away the shape of her ass when she stood in a sunbeam. We love Juliet! The girls bobbed their heads, a breeze through a cornfield. Even the floor-length lace curtains swelled at her name. Any friend of Juliet’s is a friend of mine. We are pretty fully staffed these days, but let me see what I can do . . . She floated to her desk and began to flip through the diary. And Juliet told you what we do here at the Palace? It’s, how you say, specific. Her voice was level, betraying nothing.
    
    Yes, I said slowly. She showed me the, um, rules.
    
    The woman smiled. Guidelines, not rules. She jabbed her finger at the diary. Would you look at that! Camilla called out sick tonight. She works nights, 10 p.m. to 3 a.m.; that’s when we get the broken hearts’ club. Could you come back then?
    
    Sure, I heard myself saying. I could do that.
    
    Perfect! the woman cried. The universe works in mysterious ways. She handed me a packet of papers to sign, all pale pink and smelling of vanilla. You can call me Phaedra. And you are?
    
    I answered without thinking. I’m Laney, I said, then felt a clunk in my gut, like I’d made a mistake, like I’d given something away.
    
    Laney, she said, fingering the key at her throat. I feel good about you, Laney. She touched my hair, before quickly retracting her hand. I think you’ll be a natural.
    
    Thank you, I muttered, edging toward the door. I agreed to return later that night, then saw myself out. The girls called goodbye as I took the stairs two at a time, their raised voices like a lullaby when you’re trying to stay awake.
    
     
    
    Did I stop to consider what this experiment entailed, this double doggy dare? I did. Pacing Hunter’s apartment, I knew it was a bad idea. I knew that I could walk away. And yet I returned at 9.50 p.m. in a white eyelet sundress I’d found in Hunter’s give-away pile, smelling of orchids and dread.
    
    I’d assumed Phaedra would train me herself, that I’d spend my first shift in the shadows. Instead I was once-overed by a wispy knockout named Demi, who wore bridal lingerie and her hair in two buns. Howdy partner, she said. That was all. There were six other girls on the schedule for the late shift. Phaedra had already gone home for the night.
    
    So we just . . . wait? I said, toying with a plastic rose. I hadn’t thought to bring a book; I’d thought only of Hunter and the weird ways she touched men for pay. That fixation had brought me here, to the scene of the crime, which no longer seemed so criminal. Behind me, two girls played Twister, their full mugs of tea dangerously close to the mat.
    
    Demi glanced at me over the top of her Architectural Digest and shrugged. Pretty much, she said. A little dust-colored dog lay in her lap. Ninety percent of our business is walk-ins. Until someone comes, we just chill.
    
    The first customer arrived at 10.20 p.m. As soon as the doorbell rang, the girls around me sprang to their feet and formed a semicircle in the center of the room. The man who entered was nondescript, wearing a hoodie and jeans; he smelled vaguely of refried beans. He immediately pointed to a surfer-y chick on the end and said, C’mon over here, Kylie. She took him by the hand and led him to the room marked my angel, the two of them murmuring like sweethearts.
    
    Over the course of the night, men drifted in and out; though we displayed ourselves each time, the vast majority called out the name of their favorite girl and barely glanced at the rest of us. I tried to detect a change in the men as they left but they generally looked the same, perhaps a bit pinker in the cheeks.
    
    I felt invisible until almost midnight, when an older gentleman walked in. He was smartly dressed, as though on his way to the opera, with some sort of woodsy oil in what was left of his hair. Unlike the other customers, he took his time appraising us, making thoughtful little grunts. When he saw me, he clapped a hand to his mouth in pretend surprise. New girl? he said. Demi nodded and said, She’s filling in for Camilla.
    
    Well then, he said, I’d be happy to show her the ropes.
    
    I stared at Demi. Her face was smooth, vacant, as though we worked at a pretzel place in the mall. This way, she said, leading us both to the room marked thee angel. She held the door open and whispered to me, Don’t worry, he’s a regular. He knows the rules. Then she smiled and cooed, Enjoy yourselves! before shutting the door.
    
    A salt lamp cast soft rippled light on the walls of our room, which was barely bigger than a closet. Everything was dim and pink. The room contained a massage-bed covered in waxy white paper that made me think doctors, a folding chair, and an end table with a clock and a box of tissues. The tissues perturbed me most; I tried to think of the last time I’d dealt in cum, that spidery goo, its chlorine aftertaste. The room itself smelled of cloves and cinnamon, no trace of bodies past. The folding chair, I learned, was for the customer’s clothes.
    
    I’m Ernesto, the man said, taking my hand in both of his. He reminded me of a professor. Then he turned his back to me and dutifully stripped to his boxers, which were surprisingly dingy, frayed at the hem. He folded his coat over the back of the chair, then sat on the table. I’m all yours, he said with a pep that unnerved me. He swung his legs back and forth.
    
    OK, I whispered. Great. My heart ping-ponged inside my chest. I was sweating so badly that little capital Ds had formed under the arms of my dress. So, I said, laboring to sound normal, what are you looking for tonight?
    
    An ending, he said matter-of-factly. The soup du jour.
    
    A . . . I could barely get the words out . . . happy ending, you mean?
    
    He chuckled, not unkindly. Not necessarily, he said. Whatever comes naturally. We’ll see how it goes.
    
    I reached out to touch him, then withdrew my hand. His skin was alarmingly hot. Sensing my hesitation, he stood. Are you nervous? he said. His smile was gentle.
    
    I nodded. A little.
    
    I get it, he said. It takes some getting used to. He gestured to the table. Lie down. His chest was like a diner pancake, squishy and beige. Just try not to move.
    
    Oh, I said, feeling my stomach twist. OK . . . I lay face down on the massage table, feeling the paper crinkle under me. He’d warmed it up with his thighs. I closed my eyes and tried to empty my mind, prepare myself. I waited for his touch, slimy or dry. I could smell his piney hair oil and anti-itch cream. I can always overpower him, I thought to myself. I weighed at least thirty pounds more than he did; this thought comforted me.
    
    But he didn’t touch me. I heard him circling the table. He was suddenly agitated, unsettled. Oh, he whimpered. Oh, oh, oh. He gripped the edge of the table with unexpected ferocity. No! he cried out, his voice both childish and ancient. I felt something wet on the back of my neck. Ernesto was crouched over me, weeping into my hair. Why? he moaned. Why? He sounded so sad that I began to cry too. What will I do without you? he moaned. I don’t want to live without you. I don’t want to be here anymore. When he took a jagged inhale, he made the table shake. I wanted to comfort him but I sensed this would forfeit the game; instead I held my breath and tried not to move, letting my snot drip to the floor. I played dead while Ernesto beat his chest; the sound was like lemons plopping onto a lawn. It isn’t fair, he kept blubbering, it just isn’t fair.
    
    He grieved for what felt like a long time. Eventually his wails petered out into sighs, until the room was quiet but for the occasional sniffle. I felt his papery hand on my shoulder. That was good, he said hoarsely. Very good.
    
    I sat up and was surprised to see that he’d already put his clothes back on. I looked at the clock on the table; only twenty minutes had passed.
    
    Are you OK? I asked. I felt lightheaded.
    
    He nodded, buttoning his coat. Oh, yes! That was just what I needed. I feel so, oh, what’s the word? He clapped his hands together. Refreshed. And it was true that his eyes were shining, his cheeks heartily flushed. What a rush, huh?
    
    I nodded, unsure if I should smile or continue to act somber. Can I . . . do anything else for you?
    
    No can do, kiddo. He floated across the room. Gotta go. My wife is waiting up for me. He stuffed a wad of cash in my hands before waltzing out the door. Till next time, angel.
    
    I sat in the folding chair after he left, thumbing through my money. I couldn’t name what I was feeling. A keen sense of accomplishment, a tingle in my cunt. A piercing loneliness. Residual longing, as though his had flaked off. It was all mushed together in me, a feeling both glitzy and dire. I had expected to feel closer to Hunter but instead I felt distant, zipped into my sadness, like when I used to get stoned and ride the bus alone, pretending to be sober; I would look at the people around me and think, no one knows the truth but me. It was a cozy solipsism, my pain like lucky underwear, meaningful only to me.
    
    Eventually I got up and finger-combed my hair. In the main room I found an empty beanbag by the window and sank down. A stick of incense burned into a teacup on the windowsill. The girl next to me was looking at her phone, laughing without making a sound. When she noticed me, she held out her screen: it showed a picture of a wet cat with the caption BAD HAIR DAY. I closed my eyes and held my breath. I practiced slowing my pulse, quieting my body’s cycles. I felt certain that the next man who walked in would pick me. He would clock my sloped shoulders, grave eyes; he would see that I was made for this, this game of aping death. Behind me, the dust-colored dog gnawed on a rose. I could hear his little grunts of pleasure, but I didn’t turn to look.
    
     
    
    For the rest of the week, I worked the night shift at the Palace.
    
    On Friday I went to a party thrown by Hunter’s friend Ducky. I didn’t want to go but I knew it would make Hunter happy. He likes you, she’d assured me over the phone. Everyone likes you. What’s not to like?
    
    I showed up early in jeans that I’d hacked into shorts. Oh, honey, Ducky said, look at you! I drifted around his apartment and pretended to drink a cocktail he’d named Cher the Blame. Beautiful girls draped themselves into doorways, talking about Last Night. You won’t believe where we ended up last night . . . There was always something happening in their lives that needed to be dissected. No! her friends screeched. You fucking stupid slut! I waited in line for the bathroom and watched two boys make out against a wall. I found myself soothed by the straightforwardness of their actions, the trusty linearity of lust, until one pulled back and said, Are you really chewing gum? They began to bicker; a pile of babes emerged from the bathroom, having apparently all swapped shirts.
    
    I lasted fifteen minutes at Ducky’s. Then I dug out my coat from the heap on the bed and made my way downtown, practicing death on the bus: eyes slitted, mouth ajar. The woman sitting next to me shook my shoulder. Hey, she said, you OK, honey? Hello? Her shopping bags banged into me, a butterfly-like battery, and she looked annoyed when I sat upright. Jesus, she snapped, I thought you had OD’d or something. She gathered her bags and moved to a different seat. I rode the rest of the way with a glow in my gut. I made $900 at the spa that night and slept until well after noon.
    
    Then came the morning when I awoke to a new text from Hunter. Good news!! Z is all healed so I booked a flight home. See you tomorrow my angel!! She sent a selfie, looking Vaseliney but radiant, wearing a shirt I didn’t recognize. My heart swelled at the sight of her: I still couldn’t believe she wanted me. Kiss kiss to my Laney love. You’ll soon be in my arms.
    
    I wasted no time. I cleaned her apartment in a manic spurt. I took a taxi to the gourmet grocery store to get the fancy coffee beans she liked, the weapon-like rye bread. I stripped the sheets and washed everything but the white dress I’d been wearing to work. I needed it for one more night.
    
    I got to the spa at 9.45 p.m., my wet hair in two braids. Things picked up quickly. By 1.30 a.m. I’d seen five dudes and made enough money to pay rent for two months. When the doorbell rang again and we scrabbled into place, I felt focused, lit up. I angled my body toward the door and was surprised to see a woman walk in. Phaedra greeted her fluidly, petting her hand. Welcome! she sang. Make yourself comfortable, no rush, no rush. Everyone acted normal as the woman appraised us, worrying the strap of her purse.
    
    It was difficult to gauge her age; she’d had a lot of work done. The skin of her cheeks was stretched taut, her lips like deflated party balloons. She had a sullen feline look, her green eyes flecked with yellow, her body poky and small in a neat black skirt suit. Her legs had the slightly wet look of nylons, something I hadn’t seen since I worked at The Nugget, guiding retirees to the smoking floor. It was impossible to tell what this woman was feeling, if she’d be sweet and melty in a room or demanding, punitive. I’d been lucky in my week at the spa; all my customers had been easy sells. The fact of my breasts hushed them. These men responded well to my directness; as soon as we entered a room, I asked if they wanted an ending, then lay down on the table and let the mourning begin. I felt sure of my skills as a corpse. I’d eavesdropped on enough of the other girls’ conversations, however, to know that men could get greedy; sometimes they wanted more, something splashy and brutal, a more obvious violence. They sought a haunted house, not a drowsy sorority. Some of them demanded refunds from Phaedra because their girl ‘fidgeted’ or ‘didn’t sell it’, because her skin was too warm or that she was ticklish. They came for gore and got freeze-tag instead. Child’s play, I heard one man grumble on his way out. Too light, too fluffy. What fucking happened to darkness?
    
    Now the woman pointed at me with a French-tipped nail. Her blonde hair was streaked with silver. You, she said meekly. I think I’d like to see you. Then she turned to Phaedra and stage-whispered, Just so you know, your elevator is broken.
    
    I led her into love angel. After you, I said, remembering to smile. You can take your clothes off, if you like.
    
    She held her purse with both hands, like she was boarding a bus in the bad part of town. All right, she murmured. She took off her kitten heels first, lining them up under the chair; she had trouble with her skirt’s zipper but didn’t ask for help. There was a shyness to her movements, a skittish femininity that felt almost teenaged, like she’d not yet acclimated to fleshiness, like her hips might be a hoax. She had to sit down on the chair to take off her nylons, which she then held in her hand like two snakeskins. I’d prefer to keep my underwear on, she said, if it’s OK with you.
    
    Whatever you like. I tried not to stare at her strappy beige girdle. The skin of her legs was smooth and white, like a new tub of ice cream. Perhaps because she was a woman I could pick up on her fear; I heard it in her pauses, I saw it in the way she smiled without meaning to. It made me uncomfortable though I tried to speak calmly. Have you been here before?
    
    Oh, no. She looked at the ceiling, still gripping her nylons. My husband used to come here. Quite a lot, actually. I found the name of this place in his diary. Over and over. He was rather . . . obsessed.
    
    Did he die? I asked before I could stop myself.
    
    She smiled, then covered her mouth with her hand. No, she said. He left me. She forced a laugh. I suppose he could be dead by now. Who knows? She touched her throat. Anyway, I was curious. She left it at that.
    
    Well, I’m happy you’re here. I smoothed out my dress. Why don’t I get on up the table and we’ll take it from there?
    
    Oh. Her eyes flashed with panic, as if I’d gone in for a kiss. Perhaps I misunderstood. I was hoping I could . . . be the one to lie down? She gestured to the table. I’d like to try it that way, if it’s OK with you.
    
    Of course! My voice was too loud; I felt my heart skitter. Whatever you like!
    
    I helped her onto the table, the paper barely puckering under her weight. She was so dainty, so thin; she reminded me of a ballerina, that studied frailty. She lay face down, her arms at her sides; some of her gray hairs stuck straight up from static. Like this? she said.
    
    Perfect. I took a long breath. Now just relax and stay still.
    
    The room went silent. For one moment I blanked. Then I closed my eyes and thought of the things I tried not to. I thought of Nevada at night, the black desert cleaved by neon. I thought of the first house we grew up in, the gravel yard, the yellow plaque above the kitchen sink that read dogs eat first. Everywhere we moved, this plaque came too. I thought of the La-Z-Boy my mother would sleep in, stinking of menthols and tiger balm. Sometimes I rubbed her feet while Sophia rubbed her shoulders. My sweet girls, Mom would mutter before she became incoherent. I thought of the bunk bed I shared with Sophia, put together by a so-called friend of our mom’s we both found so handsome we’d go mute when he visited. It’s the skinny twins, he teased us. He and my mom drank Twisted Teas and watched TV; when American Idol was on, they let us watch too. One summer he painted butterflies on the walls of our bedroom, something we’d later get in trouble for with the landlord. Trouble, trouble. Nevada was sunsets, nervy and pink; it was oranges for dinner because it was too hot to cook, it was driving while smoking and getting in trouble with people who did far worse.
    
    When I was in high school, my mother asked me, Did Jeremiah ever touch you? That was the name of her friend. No way! I cried. Never! I felt angry at her for suggesting it, for scrambling my memory of a man who’d been kind. It felt unfair of her to pin him as our family’s bogeyman, as if by singling him out she could undo her own failures, as if he could be blamed for my lack of ambition and Sophia’s depressive spells, which got longer each time. We both knew Sophia felt sad but I never thought it was serious. She’s wound up, I would say when friends asked why she wasn’t eating or speaking. Too many Red Bulls. I wouldn’t find out until Sophia’s memorial that our father had killed himself too. Runs in the family, a distant aunt sighed. Chemical imbalance and all that jazz. She licked egg salad off her fingers. Take care of yourself, love. He even did it the same way as she did: slit wrists in a shower stall because we didn’t have a tub.
    
    I touched my cheek; it was damp. The little pink massage room went wavy as I wept. Sophia, I whispered. I miss you. I miss you. It was all that I could think to say. The woman on the table lay perfectly still. When I looked at her back, I didn’t see Sophia. I just saw a body, hard angles, crimped skin. I got closer and studied the sunspots on her shoulders, little cappuccino stains. I wondered if my mother had them too; she loved to sit in the yard on her one day off, sunbathing with the dogs. Sunscreen is for narcs, she’d bark, her skin turning the color of rotisserie chicken. Even on triple-digit days she wore jeans. I never once saw my mother in shorts; a lifer waitress at a big-shot steakhouse, she was embarrassed of her varicose veins. She and this woman could be the same age. I let my gaze linger on the woman’s bare legs, a pink rash on her upper thighs as if they had been touched too much. For the first time I wondered: did my mom shave her legs? Did she ever wear a bathing suit? Did she have a secret tattoo, a rose or the initials of an ex-lover on the crook of her thigh? My eyes drifted up and I noticed blonde fuzz on the back of the woman’s neck. It struck me that everyone must have this, a soft spot, a hinge; she had had that fuzz there since she was a baby. I began to cry harder, thinking not of Sophia but of my mother’s dumb plaque. The last time I’d been home the plaque was hung up over the sink, which was cluttered with the baby bottles she used to feed her dogs. That was many years ago now but I didn’t need to go back to know it was still there. So much shredded, lost to time, and that was what remained.
    
    I managed to stop crying with five minutes left on the clock. You can get up now, I said. Take your time. I extended my hand and helped the woman off the table. Her eyes were glassy.
    
    Thank you, she whispered, slithering into her skirt. For the first time, she struck me as ravishing. I tried not to stare as she put on her tights. Her lips were the color of a box of chocolates.
    
    I hovered by the door, snotty tissues in my hand. My teeth were chattering, my cheeks ablaze. There was something I wanted to say to her but I didn’t know what. I felt the giddiness of a crush, the neediness of a kitten; perhaps this was the post-grieving rush Ernesto so craved, a zippy sense of having been flayed.
    
    At last the woman was dressed; she fluffed her hair and stood up. Well, she said. She seemed embarrassed, as if I were a stranger who had fainted in her lap. Neither of us knew how to name what we had shared. She licked her lips and forced a smile. How much do I owe you?
    
    My heart cramped but I managed to smile back. $400, I muttered, not including tip.
    
    I looked at the floor as she scrounged in her purse. Suddenly she couldn’t leave fast enough for me. I wanted to go home, take off this damp dress, disappear in Hunter’s bed. I wanted to fill her apartment with roses, real ones that would die. I wanted to pick her up from the airport and kiss her on the throat and say, Don’t leave me alone again. I no longer cared who Juliet was; Hunter was touchable, warm in the night. She often went to bed in pajamas and awoke in the nude. The woman handed me a wad of twenties. That should do the trick, she chirped, not looking at me.
    
    I took the cash. Thanks.
    
    Thank you, she echoed, her voice soft and far. And that was that. I held open the door and she left. I listened for the sound of her kitten heels on the stairs; instead I heard the elevator creaking to life. Phaedra must’ve finally called a handyman, I thought. Just my luck; it gets fixed on my very last night at the Palace. But by the time my shift ended and I was on my way back to Hunter’s, the elevator was out of service again, a hasty sign taped to the doors – don’t go."

    "text": "I was miserable that summer, but had little pity for myself because it was not the result of some tragic, isolated incident but of nothing other than my own personal shortcomings. I had broken things off for good with the psychiatrist – down the line we reconnected, but that summer I was twenty-three and over-certain about the way of things. I’d finally begun to outgrow the ascetic worldview I’d been raised on, newly understanding that romance was the bread and butter of life, and that the termination of a relationship didn’t signify its failure, but still I felt that losing my grip over heartache wasn’t within my financial means. I had no income, was a graduate student of the worst kind – art school – and I wasn’t even one of those creatives who could make art out of a heartbreak. No, for me, heartbreak meant breathing shallowly in bed until the cracks of my eyes burned from salt and any hint of sunlight made me flinch.

 

    The semester ended in the first week of May, after which I was supposed to go home to Fukushima for a month until the start of my internship. The internship was poorly paid, but I had wanted it badly in order to structure my summer around my writing. Before that, though, I had to return to Fukushima to take care of my mother. There wasn’t anything wrong with her other than that she was lonely. It was probable that, despite being around people more regularly as a condition of youth, I was even lonelier than she was; but, while loneliness wasn’t something I minded for myself, it bothered me considerably to think of my mother as lonely. Besides, the pulsating cries of forest cicadas would, in a satisfying manner, mirror the throes of getting over the psychiatrist. But when I went to the pharmacy to get PCR-tested the day before my flight, the results came back positive. I’d had the virus months earlier and knew I couldn’t have contracted it again so soon. Do you have a record of a positive test? asked the travel agent, when I tried to explain this on the phone. If I did, it would be lost in the dumps of trash heaps in some far-off borough, exported from the garbage chute of the psychiatrist’s apartment where we had quarantined together, a week during which I had been the sicker one and he had taken care of me, a real doctor with a permanent pinch between his dark, pensive eyes.
    
     
    
    The travel agent hung up. I was lying face-up in a sliver of space at the foot of my bed, the rest taken up by stacks of books and other items I had planned to fit inside the suitcase on the floor. I didn’t bother removing the phone from my ear. Somehow, the virus had stayed in my system, and I was unable to resist extrapolating some cosmic meaning from the endurance of both the virus and my heartache. Loud banging noises of cupboards opening and closing came from the kitchenette. Emily, undoubtedly trying to fix something she deemed disorganized, although no matter how much things moved around she wasn’t satisfied. It was the apartment itself she had a problem with, it not only lacking storage space, but furnished with old, rickety appliances. Each bang shot down the slim corridor that led to my small room.
    
     
    
    It was evening, but daytime in Fukushima. I imagined my mother’s slippered feet pattering around the wooden slats of our home, making preparations for my arrival. I could see her fingers working through a pile of anchovies on a paper towel, using her thumbnail to slice through the silver bellies and extract ropes of intestines. It was the meditative kind of work that took her back to when I still lived at home. Since I’d left she had been languishing in search of something of equal demand to occupy her. I picked up the phone, heard three long rings. Oka-san? Hai! She answered with an invigorated laugh. Your voice is good? I said. Ah-ha, is that so? So I played a little last night. . . It took me aback to hear she had anything close to a night of fun. My mother was the kind of person who moaned about a headache after a sip of alcohol, and rarely left the confines of our house, claiming she was too weak boned for physical activity. What could fun entail for her?
    
     
    
    She was alarmed by the sudden change of plans, then quickly reasoned there was nothing to be done. She sounded resigned, as if going on about it tired her. Maybe I could make it in a few weeks, I said. What about your job? I could push it back. No, no, she said. That’s no attitude to show your employer. She fell quiet. We used to spend hours on the phone, speaking only occasionally, accompanying each other’s long and sullen silences until one of us trudged up a forgotten, trivial topic, but recently I’d noticed a shift in her behavior. She was quick to want to hang up, mentioning a golf lesson or a lunch appointment. Hoka ni iitai koto wa aru? Is there something else you wanted to say? Her voice sounded subaqueous, and my eyes stung as I gazed out of my air shaft.
    
     
    
    My mother hung up. I forced myself into my desk chair, turning a new page of my notebook. On the page, there was the sentence I had written and rewritten, the same slants of my handwriting forming a gray wall. For weeks, I had been sitting at my desk for hours at a time, thinking that by doing so I would be bound to write something. But I only became amazed by the fact that I could dedicate so much time to accomplishing nothing. Yet there was the occasional morning – when it was early enough that there was no sound and I felt rested but still in that numinous sphere of consciousness where I hadn’t yet succumbed to the unoriginal thoughts of daily life – I would write a sentence whose pith collided with a dimension of the unknown, silently surpassing the bounds of intelligence that generated it, and I would feel a bright beam of inspiration that carried me until the next rare moment, which sometimes wouldn’t arrive for weeks.
    
     
    
    Hello, anyone home? It was Emily. Can we talk out here? she asked. I was still not used to my door being closed in the first place, something we both started doing since Jacob, her boyfriend, began coming in and out of the apartment. In the beginning, I had tried to get to know him, but instead of reinforcing mine and Emily’s commonality it had only made his presence more prominent. He made a habit of tidying things, and the apartment became less cluttered. Objects receded into the rooms of their original owners, taking with them the taut energy that had run between us for half a decade. For a week, we had been stuck in one of our regular ruts of ignoring each other, not speaking upon returning home and listening for when the other person was in the bathroom, or kitchenette, so that we wouldn’t use it at the same time. The air remained sealed tight until one of us left the apartment, and the hide-and-seek could go on for weeks. I consoled myself that this was a natural reaction to two people living together in cramped quarters, which shouldn’t worry me because it was an equally natural reaction for the heat to crest and resolve itself. Do I have to come get you? She called out. When I could bear to sit up, I opened my door. I squinted, shielding my eyes from the bright fixture in the narrow hallway. When I stepped down onto the hardwood floor I instantly felt a small stab on the bottom of my foot, but when I lifted my foot underneath the light I couldn’t see anything.
    
     
    
    I hobbled into the kitchenette, sliding into the chair across her at the table. One second, I said, craning my neck to examine what it was that had stabbed me, though I already knew it was a tiny shard of glass from a frame I had dropped a year ago, which had shattered into tiny pieces that spread everywhere. At the time I had collected and discarded them, worried that Emily would step on one at some point. An entire year had gone by without incident, and now blood gushed down the curve of my foot. I had the urge to make a joke about the symbolism behind the source of my pain being invisible, to share a laugh with her that would, in its resulting joy, entirely obliterate the tension of the past few weeks, or to at least see her grin in response to me, but I was dissuaded by her furrowed look of concentration. It’s glass, I said instead. Oh god, she gasped, jolting towards paper towels and a pair of tweezers. Emily took my foot in her lap, frowning intently at the extent of the bleeding. I took my foot back and jabbed at where I thought the shard might be, finally getting it out by squeezing the skin around it. Emily sat back in her chair, wiping her forehead with the back of her hand. Sorry, I said. What did you want to talk about? Emily shook her head, saying, Nothing. It’s not important. This was a lie, I thought, but didn’t push the matter.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    I spent the following week alternating between my desk and wasting in bed, only leaving to use the bathroom and, on my way back, reach into the kitchenette to grab a plum from the diminishing stack which was all I had to eat. My body subsisted on some lower level of being, like those desert frogs that could lay dormant under a scrim of mud, with barely a heart rate, for decades. I hardly kept track of anything, including my phone, so it was then that I almost missed the email from Chiara Pastorino, the Italian writer who had taught me last semester. The email read simply, Ciao – would you like to babysit my boys next week, 5 p.m. on the 16th?
    
     
    
    That spring, at the tail end of the semester, Chiara had hosted class in her home due to a graduate student worker protest being staged at the university. Class had been winding down one night when I heard the click of the hidden front door and the chirping of children’s voices, to which I refocused my waning attention. There were two boys, the younger of them a toddler who couldn’t walk without wobbling. Upon spotting Chiara sitting in her wingback chair, her long, slender arms raised mid-air as she taught, he raced toward her, climbing up into her lap and touching her face. It shocked me to see her, whose serious demeanor translated even onto her poised and angular body which she kept under drapes of black silks, be poked and grabbed without dignity. She seemed embarrassed to be seen like this and shot glances at the part-time nanny who stood by the front door. The woman seemed timid, unwilling to encroach upon our learning space, so I got up, lifting the toddler into my arms and rocking him on a kitchen stool. Chiara usually showed irritation at any deviant classroom behavior, but the glance she gave me shifted from hesitant to trusting. After class she briefly let me entertain the child with toy blocks as she answered my questions about Keats, and what Coetzee meant by the terms of a well-made realist story.
    
     
    
    I would have stayed longer, but I was dreading the two-transfer journey home on the train and the prospect of being awake when the sky turned dark. The next day, I would tie myself to my desk, writing. Without the psychiatrist, a space had cleared up in my life, from which I generated an amount of focus and productivity which left me spent and wondrous in its aftermath. Still, any little phrase that reminded me of him shot me back to how things had been when I was with him, when we reached for each other at night, in search of each other’s sedative touch. Only in those solitary blips did I admit to myself how weak with happiness he made me, a kind of happiness I couldn’t experience even with Emily, with whom my friendship ran deeper, like an ancient river. That realization, that even the strongest of friendships could not overcome biology, was the greatest heartbreak of my early twenties.
    
     
    
    During those months without him, on some weekend nights, I was forced to go out by Emily. She dangled from my side, boasting to everyone that I was getting an MFA., drunkenly emphasizing each letter as if it had the cachet of the FBI, or the CIA. Guess what that stands for? I asked, and this elicited crooked smiles. Masters in Finance Associates? Master of Film Art? Masters in Finance Arts? It was my lame joke that was fun for no one, not even me. Half the men out at these clubs were there because their bodies required it – it was, the most articulate of them explained, a reflex to enduring ninety-hour work weeks. I nodded as they downed tequila shots, looking handsome when they grimaced at the bitter taste. We would leave together, their fingers spinning me as the thumping of the music faded and we wobbled down the streets and into a yellow cab. They looked sophisticated, at ease with their arms draped above the black vinyl banquette, and with my head against their chest I would be having a good time, but then the cab would halt to a stop and it would be time to pay. They’d bend over and I’d lift my head, and in the fragment of a second before shoving their credit cards into the machine slots, a choked look would flash on their faces that belied their youth and the truth would come out that they were pretending. They didn’t know anything more about life than I did.
    
     
    
    Chiara lived in a family co-op in Crown Heights. It was a twelve-minute walk from the subway station, a large brown building without much character or style. The lobby had a complicated bell system, but a friendly woman with a stroller chatting in the lobby caught my face through the glass pane and let me in. Chiara lived in a fifth-floor unit. I knocked twice then turned the knob, stepping into a narrow hallway which I was surprised to see cluttered with backpacks, shoes, and more piles of stuff on stools. Come inside, come in, Chiara suddenly materialized, her Italian drawl distorted by her frenzy of getting ready. Great to see you, I said. I sat down in a chair clutching my tote as she paced in and out of the kitchen. I understood retroactively that she wiped the apartment of photos when class had been held – photos that had since been put back: ones from her wedding, trips, and joyous moments of what I took to be various landmarks of the boys’ babyhoods. I stared intently at one taken at the beach, Chiara’s stomach exposed and round, pregnant with one of the boys. I wanted to look closer but pulled away. The fact that she had left them out signaled she was entrusting me with something, which I didn’t want to jeopardize. I heard a loud clatter of pots and pans, and I got up from the chair to check on her in the kitchen.
    
     
    
    She had set a pot, two cans of Campbell soup, and two bowls atop the kitchen counter. When I walked in, she looked at me then pointed at them with the cigarette she was smoking. She spoke, but the words were obscured by her accent. I felt myself tense up as if we were in class, where I expended a disproportionate amount of effort trying to decipher her. She cleared her throat and repeated, If you could serve them dinner, gesturing at a Post-it note with instructions on the fridge. Oh, of course, I said. She tapped her cigarette on the glass ashtray by the window. I admired the confidence it took to smoke in a household of children – something my mother would have balked at but to me seemed courageous. So, she said, huskily. How are you? Her eyes were half-opened slits. She seemed far then from her novels proudly lined up on her bookshelf, from the steely author photo I so admired and showed anyone I got the chance to, saying, Look how beautiful she is, look, as if it was something that related back to me. I changed the subject by asking where she was heading off to. A friend’s art event, she tried explaining to me but I understood only abstractly. Although I was younger than my classmates, ever since discerning my ambition, she had treated me with a reciprocal seriousness that meant a great deal to me. She took a last long drag and looked at me before saying, You don’t have to wait for me. I stood before her feeling slow until I realized what she meant: that I was there to watch over her children, which in the overwhelming pull of her presence I had forgotten about entirely.
    
     
    
    I started down the narrow hallway following the raucous sounds, pushing open a door. The boys were wrestling in the hull of a bed shaped like a ship, Henry’s butt smashing down on Kian’s gleeful face. Upon noticing me they quieted down, suspending their play to gaze at me, and I gazed back, my heart flushing with a female sensation. I had forgotten their ages and found it difficult to guess them in the same way that, when I was a child, the ages of adults had all blurred together.
    
     
    
    Hey, guys, I said, stepping over the toys that scattered the floor. Henry loosened his grip on Kian, who came running toward me, the bottoms of his feet slapping the floor and his face bright and open like a sunflower. He dragged my hand, handling me roughly as he bolted to the far corners of the room to hand me different kinds of toys, as if it were a timed mission. Henry smiled goofily, watching his brother race around, occasionally glancing at me as I received each new item from Kian and showered him with praise.
    
     
    
    Kian, what’s this? I asked, crouching down to the floor where there was a half-finished puzzle game. Once I sat down, showing interest, Kian came over to stop me, wanting instead for me to watch him complete the puzzles. At first Henry seemed shy, trying to appear above these childish games, but once I cajoled and integrated him into our play, he became competitive. I encouraged Kian, completing some for him and placing the pieces he needed near his hand. Yet he didn’t seem bothered by losing; in fact, I wasn’t even sure he knew he was competing, only that he was elated to be with his brother, that a game meant for him was becoming the center of all our attentions.
    
     
    
    I had babysat before. For some reason, never boys, and not in years, but I would have taken any opportunity to feel close to Chiara. I turned, catching her gray eyes watching me from the door. Anticipating her departure, the boys abandoned me and rushed over to clutch Chiara’s pant legs. She stood calmly, her fingers reaching down and ruffling their auburn heads. Henry’s sunburned, that’s why he looks like this, she said. Oh, I replied. Should I put aloe on his face? I asked. Henry yelped, darting away from both of us to the ship. Chiara’s black eyebrows soared up before her eyes resettled on me. Dinner’s at six. Kian goes into his bath by seven, then once he’s done, Henry can run his own bath. Kian likes to be read a couple books before bedtime at eight, and he may plead with you to get into bed with him, but you mustn’t. Henry may stay up reading in our bed until Kian falls asleep. If there’s any trouble, Henry knows the low-down. When will you be back? I asked. Late, she said wearily, heading for the door. It was only after she left that I realized she hadn’t left a number to call in case of anything, which was alarming until I recognized the omission as deliberate and synchronous with her personality.
    
     
    
    I left the boys to play, stepping into the kitchen where the lights had been left on and made all the reflective surfaces appear bright and angry. I rummaged around unselfconsciously. The fridge was packed so tightly that looking at any one thing too closely overwhelmed me. Packs of yogurt, string cheese, mandarins, and what looked like leftover salads and tortellini sealed tightly in red-covered Tupperware. Atop the fridge were crates of juice boxes and several different bags of bread, and whichever cabinet I opened was stacked with boxes: pasta, oatmeal, applesauce. A large array of pots and pans hung on the wall. No space was left unused. I stood in disbelief about how much it took to feed a family of four when something brushed my shins. I jumped back; a cat, old and gray with patches of missing fur, turned away from me and lowered its head over a bowl of food in the room’s corner. I opened the soup cans, pulling the tab rings and feeling the smooth metal tear. Inside, pockets of grease floated on a dull yellow surface. I emptied the contents into the pot, stirring occasionally because it seemed like the correct thing to do.
    
     
    
    I prepared the bowls, placing two ice cubes in Kian’s as instructed on the Post-it. I waited for the soup to boil, turning the empty cans in my hands. I was surprised Chiara hadn’t cooked something more nutritious for me to heat up. My mother had not once let me eat canned soup, making all my meals from ingredients she chopped, diced, and minced with her own hands, standing for hours in the kitchen while I sat at the dining table, going down a math practice book with the AC wind blowing on me. On the phone, I had begun telling her about ways American mothers behaved in hopes of making her feel superior about her more meticulous methods, but after the initial burst of delight, her voice dropped into prolonged silence, indicating doubt about what her extra efforts had all been for, given, I knew, my failed career choice. Once I was in high school, so battered by the years of fighting my mother’s erratic, violent outbursts which had completely fazed and destroyed me in childhood but I gradually understood to be the only possible outcomes of her extreme and lifelong self-abnegation, deferring every one of her wants and needs to her parents, spouse, and child, my feelings of guilt and sorriness for her transpired into ones of anger. I became firm in my conviction that she had been wrong. I blamed her for her labor and told her that she should have fed and raised me with less care, hiring someone to watch me while she went out and lived her life, that it was for those reasons that I had no space to breathe and had to leave her, which resulted in both of us stranded on opposite ledges of the world. Yet once I got even older, whenever I felt I reached the brink of doing something majorly stupid, something that was bad even for me, I found myself unable to go through with it due to my inability to forget the fierce love with which she had raised me.
    
     
    
    It took until the soup came to a boil to feel that Chiara was truly gone, that I was expected to assume her role for the night. I turned the stove off, and with each stir, my aloneness shifted from being the reason for my worries to the reason for my confidence – I no longer had to compete with her. Alone with the boys, now, I was their mother. I could pretend that things had taken the other turn with the psychiatrist, that it was years into the future, when the dust had settled, and we were living the good life he had wanted for us. I was a mother with two living and breathing boys, whose existence was the most inarguable achievement. It was just another night. I had finished preparing a meal for our family, one ear attuned to the boys playing, and any moment I would hear the echo of his footsteps grow louder in the hallway and come to a stop. The metal combination of the front door would unspool, and the door would unlock. I ladled soup into Kian’s toy-like bowl and a bigger portion into Henry’s, before sticking my head out in the hall. Boys, dinner’s almost ready.
    
     
    
    When I stepped out of the kitchen with the bowls of soup, they were already sitting comfortably on the couch, engrossed in Toy Story. Here you go, I said, and they extended their arms to me. I sat down in Chiara’s wingback, which somehow resembled her. I watched as the boys ate their first spoonfuls, unexpectedly delighted when they ate so well. Behind the chair was an entire wall of books, some ledges displaying more photographs.
    
     
    
    I looked back at the boys, then at the photos to try and see in which ways they resembled Chiara, and in which ways they resembled their father, whose face didn’t capture my attention as well as Chiara’s. She was that rare kind of woman who could be the oldest in any room but still the most beautiful. I picked up the frame closest to me, leaning in to observe her in the arms of her husband, both of them facing a setting sun. All the photos revealed a private part of her that was carefree – a stark comparison to the dark and brooding writer who had taught class with such severity that she needed to punctuate the hours with smoking. As I held the picture in my hands, it felt inviolably true to me that if I had agreed to start a life with the psychiatrist, perhaps there still would be the books I would write, but not the ones I had meant to write. I had no proof of this, and in the days I spent unable to get out of bed, I wrestled over whether this was true, or if denying the psychiatrist had simply been a pointless act of self-hatred – an effort to commit some productive act in my relationships while I was unable to be productive in my work. I sank deeper into the chair, and the cat that had been circling around my ankles jumped into my lap, driving the flat top of its head into the inner parts of my legs. It wanted my touch, and I rubbed its back with one hand while with the other I covered my eyes.
    
     
    
    A warm touch spread over my kneecap. I blinked, surprised to see Kian standing in front of my chair. His shirt was dribbled with soup, but his smile was triumphant as he reached up for me to lift him. The cat jumped off as I pulled him on. What’s the matter? I asked. I held onto his lower back as he faced me, his grin stretching wider upon receiving my attention. He would not stop being cheery, and I felt sorry I could not match his enthusiasm for life. He crawled down to reach the small cabinet beside the chair I hadn’t even noticed, pulling out one toy instrument after another: first a tambourine, then a mini accordion, then a drum set, each one larger and more elaborate than the one before that I was stunned by the sheer volume of objects suddenly coming into view. Watch this, he said, trying to demonstrate the drums, but the power was turned off and he cast a forlorn look. I turned it on, willing to endure the abrasive honks. He warbled words I couldn’t decipher, but he didn’t seem to mind. As he continued poking and grabbing at me, occupying my attention, the possibility flickered through me that he had put his hand on my knee as comfort, which moved me.
    
     
    
    So much energy poured out of him that I could not keep up, and once or twice I looked the other way. Mommy, he called me. Mommy, look. Seeing the reaction it had in me, he continued calling me Mommy and would not stop, and in the movements of his rapidly darting eyes I sensed the workings of an intelligence that far surpassed his age. Nevertheless, hearing this unlocked something that flooded me with equal measures of hope and despair. Ever since Kian had come over, Henry had been sneaking glances our way. Tenderness for both boys overtook me, and with Kian still in my lap I reached over to the table in front of the couch, where the remote was. I turned off the TV, and Henry’s eyes shot back. Enough of that, I said playfully, and he scampered over to my lap, pushing Kian to the side. The boys wrestled, and as they fell to the hard floor, I became worried. They both kept trying to sit on each other, but each time I thought a cry would break out from injury, I was wrong. They looked angelic with blushed cheeks, and I felt thankful for how strong they were, for the boys’ company, when I would have otherwise been alone. Two brothers. It had been what the psychiatrist had had growing up and wanted as children one day, to which I never presented any opposition, insistent on keeping my inner self closed off to him as a method of self-preservation. The truth was that, at times, my resentment for my mother pulsed so strongly that I did not want to become any more like her by having my own children. I did not want a daughter, but even more so, I did not want a son – a son felt nothing to do with me.
    
     
    
    I could sense the evening advancing, though light still shone through the windows behind the couch. I checked the time and stood up. I’m drawing your bath, Kian, I said, to which he screamed and shot his head up like a gopher, shaking it feverishly. No, no, no! he chanted. I stopped; I hadn’t anticipated resistance. Come on, now. Why not? I tried to reason with him, but he would not stop shaking his head. I went off to the bathroom where the bathtub waited, large, white, and clean. I turned the faucets and closed the door behind me to muffle the thundering gush of water. Kian had hidden behind the couch cushions. I lifted him out and cradled him in my arms, trying to calm him down, but his cheeks burned as he kept swinging his legs. Sit down, I said, pointing a straight finger to the couch, but he scampered to his room. I chose not to immediately engage, instead stacking the toy instruments back inside the cabinet and clearing the cups and bowls in the kitchen. I wet paper towels to wipe up the driblets of soup on the living room floor. I checked on the bathtub then knocked lightly on the boys’ door.
    
     
    
    The room was quiet as I stepped in. I saw them inside the hull of the ship, the mounds of their bodies moving underneath the covers and their pale knuckles gripped over the top sheet. As I stood over them a massive wave of weariness overtook me, and I sat down on the bulwark. I pulled their covers down with such gentleness that it surprised them into capitulation. Their blank, damp faces smiled up at me, and I patted their ruffled heads. Kian, five minutes until bath time. Ten minutes, he said. He blinked his large, green eyes and I wavered. Seven, but that’s it. He raised his arms up in triumph and shot out to his toy bin. The bin was clear, so I could see him reach inside for what looked like a jar of sand. Stop, I said. Don’t touch that. He turned to watch me, then moved his hand slightly to the side to grab an action figure next to the jar of sand. He was testing my limits; I did not know how to react. I passively received each toy he took out, and he worked so quickly that by the time I saw that the chest was almost empty, he was handing me the jar of sand. Time’s up, I said, and ignoring how much he kicked and screamed, I took him to the bathroom where I turned off the faucets and it became so quiet that I thought I had somehow shut off all sound. Come on, I said, rubbing his back before removing his shirt. He was more willing to take off his pants, lightly grabbing onto my shoulders for balance as he removed one leg at a time.
    
     
    
    Good boy, I said, lowering him into the tub. Once in the water, he seemed pleased, blowing raspberries on the surface, and splashing me. I pulled back, but he wouldn’t stop. I rolled up my sleeves. My boat! My boat! He said, pointing, and I saw yet another bin of toys above the toilet tank. I handed him the boat, and he asked for the submarine. I stood, my shadow falling over him as I brought my hands to my waist. No, Kian. You can’t have both. You must choose one. Both! He screamed. No, I repeated, and he lifted one arm, slapping it down to make a large, sweeping splash. Wet fabric latched onto my skin and thin rivulets ran down my ankles. The voice that shot out of my body didn’t seem to come from me, sounding so harsh and sharp-edged, each word landing like a hot lashing, that I was transported to those times in high school when any meal my family ate out together was terrible and sullen, with some anger wrought all over my mother’s face and my father’s forked frown lines as he tapped his phone; the utter depletion of life I felt in their presence. Kian’s eyes stretched out with fear, darting between me and something else. I turned, catching Henry by the door. Instantly I filled with regret. I patted down my clothes, spotting a bottle above the bathroom sink. Come here, Henry. How about some aloe? I said this as normally as possible, wanting to show him that what he had just witnessed had not been my true self. He shook his head, disappearing behind the door. I left the door open for the rest of the bath, making a point to be extra gentle with Kian so that Henry would be able to hear me. But from that point onward Kian played mildly, no longer disobeying me, which was what I had wanted, but I wasn’t happy. The incident had drained the only remaining hopeful part of my heart, sorrow already rushing in to fill its place.
    
     
    
    By the time I left, it was deep into night. Seeing the train cross over the bridge had the effect of making the journey feel longer than it was, and by the time I walked up my five flights of stairs, my head pulsed as though it were being squeezed lightly like a grape. I was surprised to see the lights still on in the kitchen, and more streaming out from Emily’s room. I was transported to days of returning home at dawn when she would be waiting – her eyes fixed in anticipation for me to dismiss whomever I had just spent the night with. I shook off my shoes, and when the floorboards creaked, Emily appeared in her nightgown, so big on her that it made her face look small and sweet. Can we talk? She asked, and when we sat down at the edge of her bed, she composed a face laden with meaning. She said, I’m not continuing our lease. The words drifted like fall leaves. What? I said. Jacob asked me to move in. Jacob? You’ve barely dated. It’s been almost a year; eleven months on the thirteenth. I frowned at that, and she frowned at me. After a silence a smile broke out on her face, and only because she could not help herself did it move me.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    The last days of our lease together ended. I helped her stack items into one box after another, taped them. It was warm on the day she left. The sky was lighter, the streets teeming, summer just beginning. I had found a PhD student to take her room, but before she moved in I had the apartment to myself for a couple weeks. I kept her door closed and pretended Emily was still there – that I could hear the muffled sounds of her typing on a keyboard, but after four days I gave in. I moved through her room hesitantly, my bare feet hardly picking up a single mote of dust. She had hired a cleaner to scrub the room, and once finished, all the debris cleared away, all that energy expended, I felt betrayed that the task had not been left to me; now that she had more money she could afford to be sanitary in her relationships, to incur no grievances which had exasperated me at times but made me soft for her. Many nights, I sat in a corner of the empty room simply missing her.
    
     
    
    The internship started in June. Every day was the same. I sorted mail, opening packages, but not anything that looked remotely personal. I shredded paper and emptied the trash. I set the table for lunch, ran the dishwasher. I answered the buzzer and welcomed guests, holding the door open and asking how they liked to take their coffee. Noa, my boss’s assistant, seemed apologetic when giving me these tasks, and would not have believed that I enjoyed their domesticity because I couldn’t repress that side of me.
    
     
    
    It was still light when I returned home. Most days I fixed up a simple meal, but sometimes I ate with a friend, and sometimes there was laughter. If I was in the mood, I set out on a walk. I took the same route, making deliberate turns to pass the apartments friends had once lived in, parcels of the past that now felt very distant. The sidewalks dipped and lengthened as I approached the highway, where the whoosh of vehicles compounded into a stream of white noise, which I imagined as an analgesic fog one must pass through to reach the other side, the pier. I liked leaning against the railing at the furthest point out, where the misty breeze lifted off the surface of the water and wafted up toward me. I stared out at the lit-up Jersey skyline, my eyes sometimes following a boat coursing through the waters. Some nights a tango class took place under the white tent where pairs of young and old people danced, circling other pairs who had their arms around each other, and watching this made me happy. I returned home by sunset and went to sleep, waking up as the sky turned light. It was miraculous what sleep could do. In the morning, no problem seemed too big or permanent. I lay awake, registering my thoughts and the objects in my room which looked edgeless and indeterminate without my contacts. I washed the grime off my face with cold water and poked around the kitchenette, where I no longer had to be careful about closing a cupboard too loudly, though sometimes I still was as a silent act of love."

    "text": "The culture of hedonism and the exaltation of entertainment was at its peak a few hundred years ago, when Melaka was under the rule of Sultan Mansur Shah.

    The prosperity of Melaka cannot be described in words or written in ink. The Sultan’s luxurious riches exceeded those of all the European rulers at that time, when the Malay language was far more influential than English. It was the language of trade and economy of the Southeast regions, to the extent that anyone who did not know Malay was assumed to be a fool. The zawiyah religious schools all over Asia taught subjects like mathematics and science in Malay, because no other language had succeeded in becoming a medium of knowledge. English was only spoken by a few tribes in the island of Wales, who were obviously poor, undeveloped and completely dependent on the courage and benevolence of Robin Hood.
    
    To attract visitors to Melaka, Sultan Mansur Shah suggested a Malay singing competition should be held, focused specifically on the performance of dondang sayang – very delicate and highly artistic songs. The purpose of that intelligent Sultan’s was none other than to further propagate Malay as the language of arts and culture, and enshrine its status of lingua franca.
    
    Accordingly, the merdangga was beaten by drummers in every village to invite young singers with dulcet voices who were eligible to be the royal biduanita.
    
    The story is told that news of the competition reached the daughter of a warrior from the interior region. Miss Siti Mustika was her name, and she was well-known among the local folk for her pleasant singing at wedding ceremonies. She had a great desire to take part in the competition. The mother of Miss Siti Mustika had herself been a traditional folk singer, ever since the time of Parameswara.
    
    On the day of the competition, people arrived in droves to see who would become the palace biduanita, and be blessed with honour, all manner of awards, and expensive presents.
    
    By the final stage of the contest, there were ten biduanita candidates who sang songs to the keroncong, zapin, samrah, joget and various other rhythms which have vanished today. Miss Siti Mustika chose to sing to the rhythm of the zapin, which caused everyone to jiggle their bodies, move their shoulders, shake their heads and raise their hips. From the moment Miss Siti Mustika began to sing, all the other candidates were stunned and greatly embarrassed. Her voice was as dulcet as the wind, as the daybreak, as the dawn, as the evening, as the twilight, and as the night.
    
    The melodiousness of Miss Siti Mustika’s voice was such that the flies ceased to buzz and mosquitoes to whirr. All wild animals stopped their chattering. Her voice, though, was not equal to that of David, Prophet of Allah, which could stop a river from flowing, and cause falling water to halt in the air even as it plunged to the ground. Sultan Mansur Shah himself was awed by the mellow voice of this pure jewel, and the queen blushed with delight at the excellence of Miss Siti Mustika’s voice.
    
    That was the beginning of Miss Siti Mustika’s career, which was legendary and historic: her voice was the talk of people from Taipeh to Tiongkok, from Japan to Java to Sumatera and every corner of Asia. To sing, to sing, and to sing was the only duty of the beautiful Miss Siti Mustika, who enchanted many people across the world and, whose talent was unmatched.
    
    For four consecutive years, Miss Siti Mustika was pronounced Queen of the Fine Art of Voice, and all manner of awards were bestowed on her during the full moon of every season. If Miss Siti Mustika sang a song of anguish and sorrow, all who heard it would indeed shed tears at the soul in her unsurpassable singing. If Miss Siti Mustika sang in a spirited way all who heard would indeed sprain and strain every joint as they danced. And what was more, Miss Siti Mustika was capable of changing the tune of songs by ear, such that she could shift the very beat and could render anything melodious. But her most impressive quality was her humility, her courtesy and her cultured speech, she who never forgot where she had come from, even after she had become wealthy with the abundant luxuries the palace lavished upon her.
    
    Nevertheless, typical of the manner of the Malay, who are full of jealousy and envy, incredible yarns were spun about Miss Siti Mustika. It was said that she was a Hindu, and had practised asceticism at the mausoleums of Borobodur, and that to acquire her exceptional and melodious voice, she had killed 999 boys who had just reached puberty, one week after their first wet dream. Pure, untainted and virtuous, Miss Siti Mustika valiantly faced all the slander and defamation by the jealous royal handmaids, and continued only with her singing, avoiding idle talk and ignoring all the malicious rumours, distortions, tricks and deceit, the wild, baseless gossip. She declared through the royal spokesman that, ‘It is not good to slander, for fear of entering into hell.’
    
    Sultan Mansur Shah himself was incensed and enraged by the indecent statements and issued an edict, ‘This is the way of the Malay, when there is anyone who is a little better, never would they wish to help but instead would wish to bring about their downfall.’
    
    It was then that Miss Siti Mustika’s greatness and abilities in singing the ghazal, keroncong, dondang sayang, samrah and zapin reached the ears of a Hindu King in Borneo Island, who believed that his biduanita, Dang Hitam (Lady Black) was more wonderful and more energetic in her singing. He wished to stage a singing competition, which would be honest, fair and judged by experts, and held in some place outside of Melaka, in order to establish who was really the most outstanding singer of Nusantara.
    
    The singing contest had to be performed in Malay, because it was the only language of knowledge, of art and of competition, even though a time would come when this same Malay language would become no more than a language of trade in its own country.
    
    A plan was arranged to enable Dang Hitam and Miss Siti Mustika to compete. It was agreed that Temasik Island would be the venue for this prestigious event. The people of Meleka, who favoured the fair-skinned, observed that Dang Hitam was actually not dark-skinned and was, in fact, quite lovely, ith a slender body, round sparkling eyes, curly hair and magnificent teeth. She had been a sentinel of the mines before her talent had been spotted in a singing and dancing competition in the south of Borneo Island. At first Dang Hitam had been light-skinned, with a pinkish complexion but after years of manual work in paddy barns, sheds and granaries her skin darkened. Dang Hitam could still be considered beautiful though, because, as even white people say, beauty is a subjective matter. In the eyes of the people of Meleka there was only one deficiency in Dang Hitam: she loved to keep her toenails extremely long, sometimes even up to eight inches. Unknown to the people of Melaka, was that this was the secret of her miraculous voice, a voice so famed for its high quality and huskiness, that this placed her as the nearest challenger to Miss Siti Mustika.
    
    The two greatest biduanita of Nusantara arrived on Temasik Island with their ardent followers. Dang Hitam had trained her vocals relentlessly to guarantee she became the champion. She even made a statement, ‘I will win to ensure that I can spread the wings of my talent.’
    
    When Miss Siti Mustika was asked about the competition she only said ‘I do not mind who wins this competition. Let’s see who the lucky one is. The important thing is to propagate the Malay language.’
    
    Five professional jury members were invited to judge. They were Madame Celine from France, Ibu Dayanti from Java, Sayidah Baskal from the Middle East, Ah Mei from Tiongkok and they were led by the only male jury member, Syed Ali Diab, specially invited from Ottoman Egypt.
    
    Thousands of people came to listen on the day of the competition, and this made for a lively atmosphere, but as soon the singers ascended onto the stage everyone became so silent that even if someone’s teeth were to chatter it would surely have been heard.
    
    The host began his speech, ‘This competition is only to delight and please, so please don’t take to heart whatever the results may be. Our true purpose is to propagate the Malay language through song. May this language be treated with dignity forever and its capacity never be disputed.’ The audience applauded. After that, both singers played a game of the ozom to determine who would sing first. It determined Dang Hitam would be the one to start.
    
    Dang Hitam sang three songs, two with vivacious beats which displayed her ability to sing loudly in a shrill voice at a high pitch, and for the qualities of her husky voice she received thunderous applause. The other song was a ballad. Dang Hitam sang with complete seriousness and solemnity. Once again the audience gave enormous applause.
    
    When the time came for Miss Siti Mustika, everyone again fell silent. Miss Siti sang three songs, two that were slow and resonant and one that was fiery. As she sang, a rainbow radiated from sky to earth, even though there had been no rain beforehand. Everyone in the audience cheered, and then was rendered completely speechless by Miss Siti Mustika’s voice.
    
    The members of the jury found it difficult to decide who should be the champion. Their discussions lasted for several days and nights.
    
    They found Miss Siti Mustika’s voice to be correct and precise. Even though Dang Hitam’s vocals were huskier, the steadiness of Miss Siti Mustika’s voice could not be contested. Miss Siti possessed a wide vocal range which could be exploited such that she could sing now in a low pitch and now, unexpectedly, in a high trill, something that Dang Hitam could not do. In addition, Miss Siti Mustika’s pronunciation was very clear and whether a song was lively or sad, she controlled her voice perfectly. There were some singers who sounded as if their voices were lilting when they sang sad songs, but when they were told to sing fast, upbeat songs, ended up breathless.
    
    Lastly, they considered Miss Siti Mustika to be sincere in her rendition. Her emotions surged out as she sang, whereas Dang Hitam sang dutifully without conveying her feelings; whether she felt happiness as she sang was unknown, whether it was sorrow, unknown, whether it was hate, or mopishness, or whatever – all unknown.
    
    The judges came to the decision that Miss Siti Mustika should be the champion.
    
    Dang Hitam was very disappointed and pulled a face as sour as a mango left to rot over two full moons. Dang Hitam’s ardent followers were very angry with Miss Siti Mustika’s victory and resorted to rioting for seven days and seven nights across Temasik Island. They continued to protest and demonstrate every Saturday evening, but Miss Siti Mustika remained calm and prayed in gratitude to God, and was thankful to the jury for believing in her talent. Miss Siti Mustika’s followers continued to increase.
    
    That is the story of Miss Siti Mustika, legendary biduanita of the age of the Malay Melaka Sultanate, who was so highly renowned. She was taken to China, to Japan, to Java, and to Europe to sing. Miss Siti Mustika never forgot where she was from. She constantly let it be known that her duty as an artist was to propagate her mother tongue and is still quoted for saying ‘The Malay language will never vanish from the world’."

    "text": "When I got home I set my purse and a bag of Vidalia onions down on the counter. Then I took off my Chanel flats. I’d paid too much for them and they pinched my feet, particularly after walking many city blocks, as I had that day. I wasn’t alone in the apartment. The lights were all on. Plus, the television hadn’t been turned off. Then I heard footsteps coming from the next room and they were my husband’s. He came up behind me and put his large hands on my shoulders and guided me to the armchair. Then he bent down and kissed me on the crown of my head and asked me what I’d done that day. We had been having some marital problems, despite having been married for only eight months. The wedding had been a big ceremony in Newport, Rhode Island, and throughout it I remembered feeling like an imposter, like I’d somehow snuck in. Just after the wedding, I told my mother that I didn’t think I was cut out to be a wife and she explained that women who believe themselves too unconventional for marriage are only flattering themselves with ideas about their own peculiarity when in truth they’re just as boring as everyone else. The therapist we started seeing for forty-five minutes once a week suggested we try to foster a sense of connection in our marriage by asking one another each evening: what did you do today? And then answering honestly.

    We had managed, for the previous three weeks, to pose the question, but I never could tell if he was answering honestly. I myself often answered vaguely, and more than once I had lied about who I’d seen or how much money I’d spent, so I could only assume he was lying too. My husband wasn’t a stupid man. He was capable of secrecy and evasion too, and adept at getting what he wanted by omitting the things that might make the other person unhappy. That was why I had married him, because he was my equal. But I was beginning to understand that equality wasn’t enough. In any case, considering the day I’d had, I felt I shouldn’t lie because what my lies obscured for a short time would invariably come to the surface later in more disruptive ways – ways that made it difficult to be a wife and a person.
    
     
    
    ‘Sit down,’ I told him. He sat and turned off the television which had been playing a commercial for diabetes medication. I began to explain what had happened to me that afternoon, starting with the fact that I’d gone very far Uptown for a sandwich. I was eating my hero in the park by the river, I told him, and drinking a Coke, when a woman walked up to me. The woman was wearing large sunglasses which covered most of her face. She looked a bit haggard, sort of eccentric, and she stood so close to me that I thought she might become violent. Not being able to see her eyes made it hard to understand what she was after. I didn’t know what she wanted: food, or money, or my purse. So I offered her half of my sandwich. She said that she wasn’t hungry and took off her glasses. She had very dark green eyes and I saw that she was really beautiful with her face uncovered. I thought then, she’s probably just an artist and she looks disheveled on purpose. The woman sat down on the bench next to me and the afternoon sun caught her face in the most arresting way. It was all a bit dramatic, I told my husband, and I was pretty turned on. He nodded. Our therapist had told us to validate each other’s honest answers, even when they made us uncomfortable. That was how trust was built.
    
    Then, I said, the woman leaned over and outstretched her hand.
    
    ‘Can I touch you please?’ she asked. I nodded. She put her hand on my face. Her palm was coarse. She held my cheek in her left hand, and then brought her right hand up to my face as well. Her expression betrayed real sadness, but it couldn’t have had anything to do with me since I had just met the woman, I told my husband.
    
    ‘You look just like my daughter-in-law,’ she said. ‘I thought I’d seen a ghost. I come out here walking each morning. My apartment is just up there.’
    
    She pointed up at Riverside Drive. I looked in that direction and nodded. Then we looked ahead silently as joggers and dog-walkers passed us by.
    
    ‘My son’s wife, Sarah. She was so bright. So pretty. Had everything going for her. Then she killed herself. I never understood why.’
    
    I told her that was terrible and put my hand on her knee to comfort her. Any sexual feeling I had was gone. The woman told me her name and asked me to join her upstairs for a cup of tea; she wanted to look at me a bit longer. For whatever reason I agreed. I put the remainder of the sandwich in my purse and walked with her up the sloping path, out of the park and into the street.
    
    ‘I won’t keep you long,’ the woman said. ‘Are you on your lunch break?’
    
    ‘No,’ I told her. ‘I’m between jobs. I used to work as a reporter.’
    
    ‘Sarah was a writer too. She wrote novels. She was editing the third one just before she died.’
    
    The woman told me she was sure I’d find more work soon since it was New York, and there were always opportunities for those who wanted them. If you were bright, attractive, took initiative and truly wanted to work, you could have anything you wanted in New York. That was why it was the greatest city in the world. Then she said her building was just up the next block. Once there, we got into an elevator lined with brass and rode up a few floors, where she let me into her kitchen which was full of masks and pieces of folk art she must have collected in Mexico and the American Southwest. She let down her hair and took down a photograph from the refrigerator and set it down in front of me. And as I looked at the picture – and I looked at it for a very long time – I truly believed I was looking at a photograph of myself. This dead woman, Sarah, looked more like me than my own mother, than my sister and cousins. Down to the way she wore her hair, we looked just alike.
    
    ‘Now you see what I mean,’ the woman said.
    
    ‘It’s unsettling,’ I told her.
    
    ‘It is, it is,’ she said and produced another picture from the fridge where Sarah looked even more like me than she did in the first. It was a wedding photo taken by the beach. Not unlike the New England beach where we were married, I told my husband. Sarah was smiling with her bridesmaids, all of whom wore black cocktail dresses and looked ahead, unaware of their futures. I didn’t tell the woman about my wedding; the other coincidences were enough. To share more would be pointless and cruel.
    
    The woman went into the next room and came back with a black garment bag. She set it down on the long dining table and unzipped it: an ivory dress with white rosettes embroidered along the neckline.
    
    ‘I designed this dress,’ she said. ‘I’m an artist. I make watercolors. The roses on the neckline, those were my idea.’
    
    ‘It’s beautiful,’ I said. I looked down at my watch. I should be going, I said. I had been with the woman for more than an hour. I wasn’t sure how it was possible – time was moving in such an odd way.
    
    ‘Will you put it on? I’m sure it’ll fit. You’re the same size as Sarah. The size Sarah was. Kill to be that small again,’ the woman said, pulling a veil out of its garment bag, smoothing it out in the mirror. ‘Go ahead, try it on.’
    
    ‘I couldn’t,’ I said. I thought that to try on that dress would have been too much, but I was so suggestible in that woman’s apartment, surrounded by photographs of her dead daughter-in-law. I stripped down to my panties and let the woman help me into the dress.
    
    She buttoned me up and placed a veil over my head. Then she looked at me with the expression prisoners sometimes have when they’ve just been released and can’t believe the world is still the world and they’re in it, or something. Do you know what I mean? I asked my husband. He said that he thought he understood, but I wasn’t sure if he did.
    
    I kept talking anyway. I told him that the woman had to hold on to the table for support, that she was shocked. At the same time she looked happy to see this doppelgänger in the old dress.
    
    ‘I kept all her clothes. My son can’t stand to have them in his apartment. Too traumatic, he says. But I don’t think remembering is traumatic,’ she said. ‘Must be a generational thing.’
    
    I looked at myself in the mirror in the hall. I could see the Hudson River through a window. I looked down at the river and up at myself in that wedding gown, back and forth, and thought I had better stop coming Uptown.
    
    I was startled when the woman came up behind me. I was even more surprised when she told me that she had texted her son, that he was a few minutes away.
    
    ‘He needs to see you for himself.’
    
    I didn’t think that it was a very good idea. But somehow, I told my husband, I felt that I was completely at this woman’s mercy. The idea of walking outside and getting on the M11 bus home without seeing it all through was unthinkable. I didn’t know if they were just grief- stricken, or just crazy, or what.
    
    ‘When did she die?’ I asked.
    
    ‘Two years next week,’ the woman said.
    
    Then, ‘She was like my own daughter.’
    
    ‘Must be a real loss,’ I said, staring down at the wedding band on my left hand.
    
    We sat for a while at the table drinking Chardonnay and waited for her son to arrive. I asked for some ice cubes for my wine and she said she would have some too. I wouldn’t ordinarily drink so early in the day; I found it impossible to stop once I started, but it would have been rude to refuse the woman’s generosity, I told my husband. I made a point to be explicit about this with him because he had been concerned that I had been drinking too heavily since I lost my job and because it was yet another thing I lied about, how much I drank. She moved to top up my glass and I told her I was alright. The doorbell rang and we both stood up. She pressed the buzzer, and some moments later a short man with dark hair appeared in the doorway. I noticed this only because I towered over him, as you tower over me, I told my husband. He was dressed in business casual and looked pretty sharp, though it wasn’t my style, or yours, I said. He didn’t seem alarmed by the scene – his mother drinking wine with a woman who looked just like his dead wife, but then he was a man who had likely found the lifeless body of his own spouse.
    
    He seemed neutral about all of it when he pulled up a chair at the head of the table beside us, and that made me feel at ease. He looked at me for a long while without saying anything, and then slipped onto the floor. I was worried that he had fainted. But he got up onto his knees, reached out, and began to kiss my hands. I didn’t pull away. I wanted him to have whatever little comfort I could give him – what did it matter? It wasn’t real. It was just a fantasy. A fantasy I felt he deserved.
    
    ‘Mom, can I be alone with her for a moment?’ he asked.
    
    ‘It’s up to her,’ the woman said. I told them it was fine. The woman drank what was left of her wine and then said she was going out for a walk. She told me that if I got tired of wearing the dress, I should just take it off and put it on her bed. Her son could show me where the bedroom was. The door shut behind her and we were alone. I asked him to get off the floor. Sitting across from him again, I asked him his name and he said that it was Matthew. I told him a bit about my life, how I lost my job, where I grew up. I was candid about our marriage, I hope that’s alright, I told my husband. My husband said that it was fine.
    
    ‘Sarah and I had a very difficult marriage too,’ Matthew said. ‘She was a deeply unhappy person. And I always thought that it was because she was a writer and writers were temperamental, that maybe she would mellow out with age, but she never did.’
    
    ‘Are you a writer too?’ I asked.
    
    ‘No,’ he said, ‘I teach engineering at Columbia.’
    
    ‘Do you enjoy the work you do?’
    
    ‘No,’ he said, ‘I grew tired of it years ago. The students are the worst part, though my colleagues are awful too.’
    
    He helped himself to the wine on the table.
    
    ‘On the night of our wedding she confessed there was someone else, had been for two years, a lover Upstate. She didn’t even know how to drive, I don’t know how she managed it.’
    
    ‘Trains,’ I said. ‘Why didn’t you annul the marriage?’
    
    ‘Probably for the same reasons you don’t divorce your husband,’ he said. He explained that he had loved her a lot, hadn’t wanted to change her nature, which he had understood as soon as he’d met her and continued to understand up until the day she died. He asked me to take off the dress. He said he couldn’t stand to look at it anymore. I couldn’t unfasten the buttons on my own and I asked him to help me.
    
    ‘It isn’t just the way you look,’ he said, standing behind me. ‘It’s your mannerisms too. The way you talk. It’s surprising you haven’t run into anyone else in the city who knew her.’
    
    ‘Well, I don’t really come Uptown unless I want a sandwich,’ I said. I covered my breasts with one hand and asked him where his mother’s bedroom was. I placed the dress back in the garment bag and followed him down the hall and set it on her bed. We stood at the foot of the bed and when he asked me to lie down, my initial thought was to say no out of loyalty to you, I told my husband, but when I thought about it, I realized it wouldn’t be a violation of anything – it wasn’t real, only a consolation. And, I asked my husband, how often do these things happen?
    
    I agreed and sat down on the bed. He pulled down my stockings and put his right hand between my legs. Then he continued to do the things he presumably used to do with his wife. He didn’t ask for my input. He seemed to be following a progression that had little to do with me in particular. And despite that, or maybe because of that, I had an orgasm even though, as you know, I told my husband, it’s been very hard for me to finish since I lost my job. When he came, he cried, which felt appropriate. I mean, who knew what was appropriate in a situation like that? We held one another in his mother’s bed, and he stroked my forehead with the back of his hand and asked if it would be alright to spit in my mouth, Sarah had always liked it and asked for it. I told him it was fine.
    
    ‘Can I see you again?’ he asked afterward.
    
    ‘I’ll have to ask my husband,’ I told him, ‘ And of course we’ll have to mention it to our marriage counselor.’
    
    He told me he understood, but that should I change my mind I could find his name on the faculty directory for Columbia University’s Engineering Department. Then he told me that when he looked at me he felt glad, that it wasn’t logical but it made him feel like there were many Sarahs in the world and that some of them had survived, were surviving. He hugged me. There wasn’t anything sensual about it. It felt like pure gratitude. Like the time we took LSD together in school, I told my husband, and we kept saying we felt one hundred percent thankful to be alive. My husband didn’t say anything, but I knew he remembered.
    
    Then Matthew got up and dressed himself. Back in his plain shirt and pants, he went into the next room and came back with the clothes I’d been wearing. I put them all back on. I slipped into my uncomfortable shoes and headed toward the door. When I kissed Matthew goodbye, he handed me a photograph of Sarah. He kept several in his wallet and wanted me to have the one where he felt I looked especially like her. The one where she was wearing black and sitting in a park, just as I had done earlier that day. Outside, I saw Matthew’s mother walking up the stone steps a little ways ahead. Her head was bowed and she didn’t see me. I went in the other direction toward the grocery store crowded with people just getting off work. I bought a bag of Vidalia onions and stood in line with all of the other living people who needed whatever they needed. They all seemed to wait with impatience, but I was glad the line moved slowly because I wasn’t yet ready to go home and resume my ordinary life. Holding the onions, I sat down at the student bar on the corner and drank one beer, then another. I burped as I watched undergrads flirt badly, binge drink and make out with one another and I was relieved to see this because all the articles I had read lately insisted young people weren’t sleeping with one another anymore. Risk and lust are not over, I thought, as I stumbled to the bus stop. I boarded the M11 and stood up front, as close as the bus driver would let me. I watched the bright road up ahead punctuated by the wipers moving across the glass, slowly pushing away the spring rain. I came to our street and saw that the lights were on and I was glad because I knew I’d see you and could tell you what had happened to me, I told my husband.
    
    When I stopped speaking, he stood up and paced the length of the living room many times. He held his face in his hand and opened his mouth as if he might speak, but didn’t say anything at all. Because I thought it might clarify things and might explain the inevitability of what had happened, I handed him the photograph I’d been given. He folded it once, then again without seeming to look at it. When he left the room and shut the door behind him, I sat for a long while in the armchair without feeling any remorse."

    "text": "My parents watch television out of tiredness, to fill the void. Sometimes separately: my mother in the morning, busying herself in the kitchen with all the breathlessness of her ninety-six kilos; my father late at night, his ankles resting on a second chair. Without shoes or socks, head thrown back and mouth half open, he wakes with a start, follows the program for ten minutes and then sinks back into an unhealthy drowsiness. One can’t help but note the necrosis in his halluces – he’s starting to die toes first.

    The intelligence they were endowed with has festered from lack of material on which to apply itself, and has taken different paths in each of them. In my father, it has created a flat-out ‘early-bird’ frenzy: at first, seeing as for work he had to go see clients at lunchtime, he merely moved the meal up from one to noon, and my mother adapted; then, progressively and imperceptibly, he expected to eat at eleven, at ten, at nine thirty. Now, when I’m visiting them and get up to go to the kitchen around nine, I find him in front of a plate of rigatoni with sauce, which he asks me if I want to try. As a result, dinner is at four thirty or five, and after that it’s television until two in the morning. At this point he hardly sleeps anymore, he gets up at six and the cycle starts over. He says he does everything so early to ‘take it off his mind.’
    
    My mother’s putrefied intelligence has mostly taken a path of refusal: the women in the building that go to play bingo are ‘old nitwits’; in the shopping malls where my father wants to take her ‘there’s nothing to see’; those who are looking to have funerals in church ‘want to dupe even Our Lord’. She’d like to be thrown away in a trash bag, so as not to be a nuisance and not make anyone pay for anything. Latched on to her rancor like a castaway to a raft: ‘you’ve put on weight once again,’ she says when I turn to present a gift to my sister, a piece of Afghan jewelry that ‘will break her neck.’ Everything is dirty or sick, the cat that hops up and down the stairs has mange, there’s no such thing as corresponding opinions (‘if I say orange, you say apple’).
    
    Often she watches the television without seeing it, confuses the characters in the soaps and asks for information five minutes after it’s been given on the newscast; with the excuse that ‘they’re all practically naked,’ she attributes one showgirl’s love affairs to another, to Manuela Arcuri the calendar with pictures of Alena Šeredová. The programs she follows more attentively are ones rife with disdain, where people are humiliated and made to look bad. She particularly likes the talent show La corrida, guffaws when the audience bang pans and blare horns to boo contestants off the stage. But Sarabanda – Name That Tune works for her too, especially since the host Papi started getting nasty with the contestants (monomaniacs or idiots savants, generally), making them dress like buffoons.
    
    These are the programs my parents watch together early in the evening during prime time, in addition to infomercials on the local channels and comedy competitions. The vulgarity they go searching for is that of the evening gatherings in the courtyard from when they were young (but they’re left partially dissatisfied – here, natural and plump salaciousness is missing, everything is fabricated and induced). It’s no coincidence that their choices are the opposite of mine: they’re not looking for an immaterial reality or a hyperreality, they’re looking for the reality that once was – that obsolete, raw reality which they no longer have. My parents almost never use the remote; once they’ve landed on a channel they stay there for the whole evening. They watch medical programs like Elisir to save on doctors; my father explains the medical terms to my mother (pretending to be an ignoramus is an old gag of hers, with frequent references to my sister and my university degrees: ‘I’m the only dunce left in this house’); out of gratitude, she repays him by not huffing throughout the never-ending hours of soccer. They’ve understood that fighting prolongs conversation. The other day, he wrote down notes to call in live on Telecanarino, a Modenese soccer channel; he got off to a fluid start, then he tripped up: ‘. . . Brazil won five World Cups, but that was because they had guys like Didi passing the ball – they even won that year Pelé was injured, with Garrincha, Vavá and . . . what’s his name . . . the one that substituted Pelé . . . dammit, I don’t remember . . . you’ll have to forgive me . . .’ They were very understanding on screen, but when he hung up he took it out on my mother for having mixed up his pages of notes – she denied it and thus they at least spent an hour out of the ordinary.
    
    At the age of eighty-two and eighty, they don’t use the television as a form of escape, but to stay tenaciously gripped on to life as it slips away. They resemble me in only one thing: their strategy for serenity, rather than multiplying pleasures, is generally to negate displeasures (but the last of all will get the better of them: death). Perhaps there’s an Emilian way to Buddhism. In any event, our familial microclimate is hardly suited for passion.

    Since going to the movies seems unthinkable to them (and for my mother, of course, getting there would be complicated), I gave them a VHS player as a gift, so they could at least get some old films with Nazzari or Yvonne Sanson, and decide what to watch for themselves rather than always being towed along. They didn’t use it even once, not out of laziness or an uneasiness with anything new, but as a moral stance: ‘we’re not so demanding.’ They accept programs the way one accepts hospital food.
    
    Theirs is a sense of guilt, distorted and turned accusatory: we weren’t able to give wealth to our children, we weren’t even able to become comfortable like our siblings and brothers- and sisters-in-law (with home ownership, at least, plus private retirement funds) – therefore the wasteful world, the world that in the meantime seduced our children and pulled them away from us, disgusts us. I don’t know how else to explain the stubbornness with which they, by mutual agreement, reject the high-quality food I bring over; I can no longer take seeing them eat only hard discount-store tuna, in giant cans with simply ‘tuna’ written on them, or blocks of Swiss cheese that resemble Styrofoam and last over fifteen days at home without developing mold. And so, in Modena’s chic delicatessens, Fini or Giusti, I buy creamy gorgonzola (which I know they like) or I stop at a butcher in the center of town to pick up a tenderloin, or have a basket of seasonal fruits prepared with Vignola cherries and plums and loquats. She says the loquats are bitter and ‘brusque’ (a Modenese way of saying ‘sour’), the tenderloin grosses her out because you can still see the blood, those three-for-one chicken breasts are much better. If I contradict them, they dig in their heels. The gorgonzola is good, sure, but you can’t compare it to the one a farmwoman used to make whose parents were from Pavia, and they ostentatiously let it dry in the fridge too, at least until I leave. ‘You eat them,’ they say of the plums, ‘you bought them for yourself,’ even if there are tons of them, and the two of them stick to the apples sold in bulk which they heap on a tray in their bedroom. Then they give in to harrowing spells of gluttony, chocolate that looks made from sawdust and two-kilo jars of ‘Norwegian’ (sic) peanuts.
    
    I know what they’d like from me, love and not food, but I haven’t been able to give them that for some time now; I’m telling you I’m mediocre. My reconsiderations would have to start from too far back, reopening old wounds that had been stitched shut with twine and healed shoddily, at best. Last week, while I was staying with them, I made a carbonara (which they obviously didn’t eat, loyal to the pseudo-Bolognese sauce that my father even brings in a jar to restaurants, where he asks them to serve him plain pasta), and, following tradition, I only used the egg yolk. Instinctively, I poured the egg whites down the sink and washed the glass; after a minute and a half, I turned around to find my mother crying, and when she saw my surprised expression she shouted ‘I could have eaten it with a little salt.’ She felt I had rejected her whole way of life, her eternal unhappy devotion.

    On the rare occasion they have people over, they now cook on the cheap; five cutlets to feed six, and a little mound of puree that would maybe feed four. Naturally, their guests keep their mouth shut and swear they’re not hungry, so much so that there’s still some food at the end, and my parents say ‘you see, you’re afraid it’s going to be too little to eat and then there’s always some left over.’ Even away from home, at my place, they don’t change their schedule in the slightest: Sergio, who as a Roman can’t conceive of eating lunch before one thirty, gets left at the table alone (in other words, with me, but never with them). They treat him as if he’s transparent. Probably, they suspect he ‘eats up my money’ but they don’t dare bring up the taboo topic, and so they stick simply to hello and goodnight, as if he were a lodger and I the owner of a boardinghouse. The fact that he loves me, or that I love him doesn’t concern them. It’s distressing that I am still able to squeeze out hate; they’re no good, and if they’re no good I don’t see why I should have to love them simply because they’re my parents.
    
    I hate the cookie dust they lick up after pouring it into their palms, because nothing gets thrown away, and the ten-year-old Easter egg wrapping folded and tucked away in a drawer, and the closet doorhandle held together with duct tape, the brown kind used for packages; I hate the smell of the towels in the bathroom, which to me seems to be the smell of piss, but is actually the smell of a poor home, of low-end detergent. The only topic of conversation with my father, for a long time now, has been how much things cost, his ‘deals’ at the Coop supermarket; he rattles off a series of numbers that I don’t follow and don’t understand, or meticulous calculations for shaving some small change off his share for the stairwell light in the building. That I don’t know the price of things appalls him but, in a way that I’m unable to explain, makes him proud too: ‘oh, your son travels in first class,’ he declared to my mother the time he came to pick me up at the station, and she, maintaining the same ambiguity, added, to me, ‘it’s good that you treat yourself like a gentleman.’
    
    My compulsion for semi-luxury is a reaction to my parents’ poverty, and most of all to their resignation. I discover this in certain excesses of mine, as stupid as they are grotesque, like eating only the small layer of cream in the center of a cake and then throwing out the rest. In the end, I apply the same evasive aesthetic when watching television.
    
    My mother’s pension is one million fifty thousand lire a month; my father’s (who was a traveling salesman and for many years didn’t pay the ‘the insurance stamps’, other than the so-called ‘voluntary’ ones towards the end of his career) is eight hundred twelve thousand. (The fact that she earns more prompts snide remarks and bickering to this day.) Just under two million lire a month for the two of them; with the new rent laws, they pay roughly six hundred thousand in rent, which leaves them with a million and three hundred thousand lire1 to live off. I feign ignorance, refusing to imagine the exact sacrifices they have to make, day after day – I’ve never tried to draw up a simple balance of earnings and expenditures. I merely send them, at the beginning of each month, an order of three hundred thousand lire and I feel I’ve done my bit. Our two economies stay starkly separated; I don’t base the amount on their needs and on what would make a dignified life for them, but on what feels like an appropriate amount for me to give. My conscience unburdened after sending the money order at the post office, I’m left with enough to treat myself to a lunch at Casa Vissani in Baschi or at Don Alfonso in Sant’Agata sui due Golfi, and maybe to a Missoni sweater. What my father calls ‘a helping hand’ is really the imposition of an imbalance between us.
    
    I know they give a part of their extremely meager income to my sister, who’s been on her own with my nephew since her husband left, preferring Brazil to her. Last year on Christmas night we were at a party and I wanted my sister to take me home. While looking for her, I went into the room where the guests’ coats were piled up and I caught her in the middle of some strange trade with a friend – she felt guilty, must have rapidly calculated that it was too late to deny it and threw herself into the mouth of truth, forcing a facetious tone. She was selling her friend the gold chain our grandmother had left her, the long art deco chain which could be wrapped around one’s neck a full three times and which was the only thing of any value in the family. ‘We’re at the souk,’ she said with an embarrassed and aggressive smile, and her generous friend added ‘yes, only the bargaining is more Mongol than Arab: I try to give her an amount and she lowers it.’ Then I remembered certain comments of my mother’s, about her twenty-year-old grandson who plays sports and needs to eat meat at least three times a week. I play at being a little nabob and my sister is barely managing to survive. I wrote her a check and with her, too, it was like I had signed for a divorce.

    You’ll wonder how, in this situation, I could speak of serenity. I want to tell you a story I heard from a taxi driver’s widow, one night when she’d been drinking, not long after I’d moved here to Borgata Fidene.
    
     
    
    story of the taxi driver’s wife
    
    She randomly gets in a 3570 taxi and, just to start a conversation, asks: ‘excuse me, do you know Antonio Detti?’ ‘Oh lady, do I know him, we’re good friends; the other day we went to that place dal Toscano with my wife and his, but it was a bust, the meat stunk like a corpse and we paid eight thousand lire a head – hey, if you’re gonna rip me off at least be lowkey about it . . .’ One question after another, he talks about her husband, it’s clearly not a case of a mistaken identity. But he talks about another wife, about other children and another home (‘I don’t remember exactly now, but it was around Ponte Bianco’). She thought that taxi driver was crazy, but in the ten years since – her husband recently died –  she’s never had the courage to ask for an explanation, to check with the 3570 taxi company, or to start an investigation. Only occasional walks around Ponte Bianco. ‘Anyways, if I knew, what would I have done about it?’
    
     
    
    I’ve adopted a similar tactic. Moreover, setting aside superficial variables, the economic framework of my soul continues to be the same as that of my parents. Besides a few swanky hotels, a few exhibitions in the Hague or Bilbao, maybe one of the things I’ve done the most frequently in my life has been to look down from the balcony railing into a deserted courtyard, on summer nights, with only an undershirt on – my stomach pushed up against the iron, like my father, like my mother; walled in by our social extraction, without any real escape on offer.
    
     
    
    —
    
     
    
    And then, in spite of everything, my parents are two serene old people. Because their conscience is clear: my father has never done anything dishonest and my mother, who’s tougher, thinks that this is why he’s stayed poor and looks down on him for it, but she can’t help showing solidarity. They’ve known each other since she was sixteen and he eighteen. My mother said to me one day ‘you know, from when I still went to the movies, and even today on the television, I’ve seen tons of handsome men, but a man who was completely handsome like your father – now that I’ve never seen.’ He still brings her chocolates, flowers, surprises her with things; for their fiftieth wedding anniversary he managed to track down the tree he’d photographed her in front of as a twenty-four year old, and then photographed her as a seventy-four year old in the same pose, but with two beachballs tied to her arms (the caption reads: ‘I married a woman with balls like these’).
    
    For them, social resignation is the child of some satisfaction in bed – purely out of luck, and, deep down, a little craven too insofar as it’s never analyzed or really put to the test, but it’s satisfaction and happiness all the same. In the past, I even envied them. When my father snores, it never even crosses my mother’s mind to move to the other room, which has been empty since their children left. She stays awake and swears that the noise keeps her company.
    
    They never listened to the dark phantoms that fluttered about, or at least never followed them. Might I be learning their lesson? Be on my way to becoming, when I’ll reach eighty, cheap and hateful like them? My father asks how the broth is, she answers ‘try it and see if it needs salt’; he insists ‘aside from the salt, how does it taste?’ to which she replies ‘like it always does’. Then he explodes, curses: ‘God damn it, can a guy not know how the damn broth is today?’ Then they make up, as soon as the Pope looks out from the basilica: ‘and if the Pope has to piss?’
    
    Is this what it will be like with Sergio, too?"

    "text": "As Nance told it, it sounded like nothing.

    Heath was half listening from the back seat of the car. ‘Ancient history, though, right?’
    
    ‘No,’ said Nance. ‘No. This was only last week.’ Only last week, she had awoken in a cold sweat, alone. She had reached for her phone and found it charging on the nightstand as usual, but without a second phone next to it. ‘Is that normal? Heath? Was he like this in college?’
    
    ‘Nance,’ Don interrupted from the driver seat. ‘Are we really doing this again?’ He looked back at Heath in the rearview mirror. ‘She’s gonna tell the story as if I’m a monster.’
    
    ‘No,’ said Nance, ‘I’m gonna tell it as it happened, to me.’
    
    Heath looked down at his phone. Nothing new. The girl hadn’t posted or messaged him, so he couldn’t reply. He searched through his other threads. Maybe he’d left someone else hanging. Not really, or at least not recently. It would be hours before they got to the house.
    
    Nance had never once reached for Don in their bed and not found him there, she told Heath. ‘It was disconcerting.’ More than that. ‘Terrifying.’
    
    ‘Alright,’ said Don.
    
    She called him – he was always the last call on her phone, top of the list, easy. He didn’t answer. She tried again. She thought she might be dreaming. But in dreams, phones don’t work. Numbers are not names – they’re scrambled captchas or license plates, glitching or unmoving. No, it was not a dream, it was just nightmarish. She called fifteen times, texted, messaged on apps in case his phone was dead and he had access to someone else’s. Nothing.
    
    Now, thought Heath, would be a good time for Don to jump in to spare him the full rant – they were on this trip together, so the story would necessarily end happily. Don was focused on the road, although it was straight and uncrowded. Indecipherable crops rolled by, offering Heath no distraction. When he gazed out the window, he was revisited by a slight carsickness not experienced since childhood.
    
    Nance had got out of bed and put on shoes, she said. Still in a T-shirt and sweat shorts, because changing her clothes felt wrong, she had walked down the stairs and out the front door. Don’s car was gone. It was after three. She went back upstairs and opened the shutter to their shared closet, as if some gap in the row of clothes would clue her in to where he’d gone.
    
    Nance and Don must have made up within a few days of this argument, thought Heath. And then today, they’d loaded up the Explorer, driven downtown together and picked up Heath from the parking lot of his apartment building, overnight bag in hand, on their way to a weekend rental in the country.
    
    ‘Want to see me tomorrow?’ asked a text sent to Heath. The number wasn’t saved, but he scrolled up and recognized the conversation. ‘Out of town, but what about next week?’ He remembered how her hair felt. Every part of her was softer than the pads of his fingers, which now gripped the phone, a portal away from this couple and the couple they’d be meeting at the house, another friend from school and his new girlfriend. An ellipsis signaled typing. It disappeared.
    
    Minutes before, they had been laughing at the names of roadside diners and gossiping about the alcoholic boyfriend of a mutual friend. In fact, the discussion about the night Don went missing had only started because Heath had said something like, ‘I don’t think I’ve ever seen you two argue.’ He’d meant it as encouragement, not a provocation. Don had responded with something like, ‘Oh, you’d be surprised,’ and then, like the revving of an ignition, came the too-familiar buzz of bickering starting up. It was a noise Heath usually did everything in his power to avoid. This was why he was still single, his sister would say, to which he’d nod, pretending to understand.
    
    ‘Sure,’ said the text, which had taken a beat too long to arrive. Sure? He was somehow already disappointing her. ‘Forget it,’ he wanted to text back, but instead sent a cartoon face with a stupid smile. He was reminded of a sound she made, a moan inside of his mouth. He pulled up a selfie she’d posted with pleading eyes. ‘Sure,’ he could hear her sigh. The tiny photo trembled with the motion of the car.
    
    Don breathed through his nose so loudly it turned Nance’s head. ‘Nothing to say?’ she hissed.
    
    ‘But you got ahold of him in the end,’ Heath said to Nance.
    
    ‘No,’ Nance shook her head. ‘He just came home, after I’d fallen back asleep. I could’ve called around or filed a missing person’s report. Who doesn’t answer their phone?’
    
    ‘And where were you, Don?’ Heath asked, understanding his role as the child they didn’t have, the entertainment and the entertained. It was a game that had started before his arrival and would continue after his departure, but he couldn’t sit it out – the third wheel’s function in arguments was always pivotal. The landscape outside tilted into tall orchards, silhouetted leaves that caused the sunlight to glisten too quickly. Heath closed his eyes and still saw the pattern flashing through their lids. His stomach inched closer to his throat.
    
    ‘Where was I?’ Don repeated. Nance shrunk into her seat and stared ahead.
    
    ‘Why don’t you say where I was?’ said Don. ‘Go ahead.’
    
    ‘I went back to sleep,’ said Nance, quieter. ‘When I woke up, you were back. You never told me.’
    
    ‘I did, though,’ said Don. ‘I told you.’
    
    Heath could hear the strain of springs and opened his eyes. Nance had turned around and put her head between the driver’s and front passenger’s seats. Her expression was softer than he’d imagined. She blinked slowly. This was a very Nance blink, usually utilized for comic effect.
    
    ‘He was at his ex’s house,’ said Nance. ‘Don woke up in the middle of the night, didn’t tell me where he was going, got dressed and drove to another woman’s house, a woman who has kids—’
    
    ‘They were with their dad,’ said Don.
    
    ‘On a night she didn’t have her kids, because you know that. You know her fucking schedule and you understand, and she understands, that if you go over there in the middle of the night –’
    
    ‘She called me.’
    
    ‘Right, and it’s normal to call someone else’s man in the middle of the night –’
    
    ‘She has a history of mental instability.’
    
    ‘And she can’t call her own ex-husband or her own – whoever –’
    
    ‘She called me.’
    
    ‘Yeah, so Don was helping his ex –’
    
    ‘My friend.’
    
    ‘His friend. He was helping his friend. Someone he used to date.’
    
    ‘We never dated.’
    
    ‘Someone he used to fuck. Whatever. Right? He went all the way over there to talk her out of a suicide attempt, or I don’t know, was she trying to kill herself, or just having a panic attack?’
    
    Don’s silence curdled Nance’s question. She was not speaking correctly about psychological disorders, Heath gathered. Don was out saving someone. What difference did it make who it was? Everything became spiked with accusations once the initial excitement made room for domesticity: negotiating schedules, family visits on Christmas, groceries every Sunday. Inevitably someone forgot to get eggs, someone drank all the beer. This was one more misunderstanding, amid the many others.
    
    No one spoke for some time. Heath noticed that no music played, that it had been like this the whole trip. He wondered if Nance had fallen asleep.
    
    Don took them onto an exit, announcing the need for gas. They rolled up to a pump and with the tap of a large button the SUV turned off. Nance, very much awake, hopped out and crossed the lot to the convenience store with one arm wrapped around the strap of her purse, the other swaying. Heath followed her, hands in pockets, through the automatic doors. He stood outside a locked bathroom and watched as Nance stared at a display. She didn’t look up, but the forced serenity of her face told him she knew that Heath was there.
    
    They had first met at a sports bar downtown, what, six years ago? She was half the size of anyone in their group but took up more airspace altogether, darting from the bartender to her new boyfriend to his friends, showing a genuine interest in IPAs and football while meeting the gaze of each man, impressing upon everyone a brown-eyed mischief. At the end of the evening, she had held Don’s hand as they walked to his car, pulling his arm in the way of a child leaving a toy store, excited to go home but sad to leave.
    
    Watching them depart, Heath had – because he couldn’t help it – pictured Don and Nance having sex.
    
    Each following encounter was fortified by that first impression. Heath and Nance spoke at other games and other get-togethers until the initial frustration at her unavailability wore away, and she became his friend.
    
    Over the last six years, birthmarks and kitchen burns became noticeable. With familiarity, postures were loosened, necks were lined, and waists bloated. Heath wondered how she would appear to him from across a gas station mart if he’d never seen her before in his life – would she now be in the category of women who didn’t do it for him? Would he, if seeing her for the first time, in their current states, picture her naked? Maybe at that very moment she was wondering the same thing. She crossed her arms, which had gained a ruddiness behind the biceps. Her eyes were glassy and sullen, unimpressed by the selection.
    
    An industrial-strength flush sounded and the bathroom door opened. Heath turned to let a dust-blonde woman hand him the knob. He glanced backward before stepping in. Nance was holding a Cheetos bag with both hands, blocking her entire head. A life-sized Chester Cheetah face glared at Heath, sunglasses and smirking snout pointed in his direction. Nance twisted the bag from side to side like a sock puppet over a partition.
    
    Inside the Explorer, they returned to the standoff and sat listening to one another’s silence. Highway traffic thickened as clouds evaporated beneath a midday sun. Vehicles emptied into every lane. Don was, Heath noted, a smooth and confident driver. Had he always been? In college, cars were mostly used for going home to parents’ houses on laundry days or breaks. Don, the philosophy major, didn’t offer rides the way Matt would. Heath remembered that Matt, who would presently be joining them for the weekend, had driven a souped-up cherry-red truck in college, but he couldn’t picture the type of car Don had driven. That was something he could ask to break the ice.
    
    ‘Didn’t have a car,’ chirped Don, his voice falsely upbeat.
    
    ‘Hm,’ Heath said, trying again to smooth the tension. ‘I thought everyone had a car.’
    
    Nance had not been listening. She turned to Heath. ‘You probably know her,’ she said.
    
    This again. Yeah, if he thought about it, surely Heath would know of a woman Don had slept with, someone who now had kids and what sounded like a pill or alcohol problem. In fact, there were a few options. He would need some more clues to narrow it down.
    
    ‘He doesn’t,’ said Don.
    
    ‘Who does then?’ Nance asked.
    
    Heath received another text, the word ‘Bored’ and a selfie. In this one, her head was wrapped in a towel and water from a shower was clinging to a bare collarbone. She’d put on lipstick for it. ‘Sexy,’ he wrote back, knowing she wanted more than that. It was called a trap for a reason. He wanted more too. He wanted to know that the image was only for him. He wanted to sit her on his lap in a big empty house with giant windows facing a lake. He wanted a boat.
    
    ‘Why do none of us know her?’ Nance said.
    
    Don and Heath met in their first semester of college. The friendship hardened on the infamous night they liked to talk about not talking about. ‘We do not discuss the infamous night,’ was a refrain he and Don and Matt would still say, making a zipper motion over their lips. There had been a house party, likely at some dilapidated, shared Victorian with a torn-up yard but appearing in their memories as a mansion with never-ending kegs. They had conspired before arriving to lie about being freshmen. Every one of them ended up with a girl or two that evening, in bathrooms or bedroom closets. At one point Heath zeroed in on two girls and elegantly brought Don into the conversation, dividing to conquer. Don never wanted to hang out with the philosophy students again. Heath could still see him cheering, holding an open bottle of whiskey over his head as they walked up the street away from that house, the sun rising.
    
    ‘He was my wingman from day one,’ Don would tell new acquaintances, an arm over Heath’s shoulder. That was before Nance, who asked Don to move in with her as soon as his lease was up, less than a year into their relationship. It didn’t make sense, him finding a new place, when she had a whole inherited house. There were ball-and-chain jokes here and there, but otherwise, Don seemed, more than most of the guys Heath had seen settle down, genuinely happy.
    
    Once they were alone, Heath would ask Don what was up – how he was really doing. Because if Don had indeed gone to a woman’s home after some midnight cry for help, the possibility of an affair had to have crossed his mind. But what constituted an affair? Were the rules of a relationship, in this milieu and moment, such that no one was allowed to lean back into the past, that everyone was always obligated to stoop forward? Heath had always wondered if there wasn’t a way to auto-renew some girls, restarting the process of knowing them, with adjusted settings. If he thought about it, every girl still meant something to him, and maybe always would. And if they aligned sexually but not otherwise, did it follow that they couldn’t go on aligning in that one way?
    
    These were people, after all, not train cars. One did not simply transfer to the next, heading always in the so-called right direction. Life and time weren’t like that; each instant contained every instant that had ever and would ever occur. Even if he couldn’t quite grasp it, Heath believed this with all he had.
    
    Girls would often lean on him after their breakups with subsequent men, happy at first to wiggle back into his arms, this time without expectations. But then, in bed, a conversation about stability would start, and in due course they would leave with a new determination to not contact him. Sometimes, they would return yet again. It was sad, he decided, that such women were so accustomed to breaking things off the moment they didn’t get their way. Still, he knew it wasn’t entirely their fault.
    
    Nance opened a bag of Corn Nuts. ‘What does she look like?’ Her crunching forced a casual tone.
    
    ‘You wouldn’t be jealous.’
    
    ‘No?’ Nance threw another handful into her mouth. ‘Can I see her?’
    
    ‘And what would that do?’ Don’s voice had a squeezed composure to it too now. Heath had heard of couples embracing infidelity as a coping mechanism. If they forgot he was there, maybe they could take a huge step in their relationship.
    
    ‘What does she look like?’
    
    ‘Ugly,’ said Don.
    
    Nance bunched the Mylar bag in one hand and dropped it in the footwell. Heath saw Don glance at the freshly vacuumed mat under her feet, his mouth just open enough to let out a fricative. From the back seat, he watched as Nance lunged sideways, grasping at Don’s shoulder, clawing at his wrists, finally launching herself up onto her knees and crashing down, pro-wrestler style, into the driver’s seat. Heath saw Don’s hands let go of the wheel in confusion. He watched as Nance took over steering, thrashing them left and right until they hit a metal guardrail, and the sound blocked out any of the words they were screaming, any of the thoughts Heath had, any other instant that had occurred in his life or ever would.
    
     
    
    Heath came back from the kitchen and settled on a corner of the rug near Matt, handing him the beer he’d requested. He sipped from his own, a hoppy local brew with green and pink spirals on its label. Don rose from his seat in the big armchair and fetched a piece of wood for the fire. The absent hosts had left a pile of perfectly chopped logs, as clean as sliced Gouda with brown wax rinds, in an iron basket next to a set of hanging tools.
    
    Nance entered from the half-bathroom and stood near Don. She picked up a pair of firewood tongs that accordioned apart and together. ‘These are nicer than ours,’ she mumbled to herself, continuing a pattern of scrutinizing each of the house’s communal objects, from serving spoon to towel rack. All the guests did this, owing to the inevitable contrasts and parallels that could be made to the things they had at home.
    
    The car was all scraped up on one side, and that was the first thing anyone saw when it pulled up. Don said that they’d gotten into an accident. Nance had helped him come up with a story about someone drifting into their lane and running them off the road. Had they been going any faster, the party decided, things could have been much, much worse, and so the annual reunion was also a celebration of their survival. No one was injured, only rattled, and the adrenaline made them better than ever, more than fine, happy to be alive, together again, approaching middle age, away from Matt’s kids and their mother. Matt’s girlfriend, Leandra, was meeting everyone for the first time. To her, nothing could be off, because she had nothing with which to compare.
    
    Leandra was, contrary to everyone’s expectations, a normal person, with pores that pulled straight when she smiled and a few grays at the temples growing out of their latest dye treatment. The discrepancy between her and the old college friends was only recognizable in the details of a braided twine bracelet threaded with amber beads and a silver anklet made from tiny, linked paperclips, each hinting at a history of impulsiveness, travel, and street food on cloud-level terrain.
    
    ‘Tomorrow, we can take the canoe out,’ said Matt. He’d made the arrangements and read through the laminated binder of instructions. The boat, oars and life jackets were in the garage and part of the deal. There was a chest filled with half-empty bottles of bug spray and sunscreen, too, he informed them. It was amazing, the way things accumulated at the secondary homes of others. He had noticed doubles of books on the shelves.
    
    Heath wondered if Matt saw how quiet Don and Nance were after dinner, but then, Matt was never known for his perceptiveness, and besides, fires tend to permit, even beckon silence. Nance, cross-legged on the carpet, stared into the hearth and the wet of her
    eyes reflected its movement, resembling the quiver of tears. Don sat on an ottoman and held an iron poker in both hands, face
    lowered, eyelids and forehead reddening, lips folded inward. As the air around them changed temperature and density, Heath saw
    them all as meat being smoked and sealed, their outsides crisping
    and their insides tenderizing. Leandra cleared her throat, sipped
    from a wineglass, and laughed, or said a word that was the sound of a laugh.
    
    ‘I was in a car accident once. I was seventeen. Sixteen? I was with my dad, in Mexico. My dad isn’t Mexican. I mean, he also didn’t live in Mexico. I didn’t know him as a kid, and then, once we met, we’d go on these trips instead of me visiting him. Or him visiting me. I’ve never asked him why.’
    
    Heath felt sorry for Leandra, not because she hadn’t known her father growing up or because she’d been in a car accident, but because her expectations for the weekend were likely nowhere close to being met. He wondered how she and Matt would discuss the group dynamic that night in bed. Then, of course, he pictured them having sex.
    
    ‘We were on this vacation with his girlfriend and the whole thing was strange because they were basically strangers to me. My grandparents lived in Boston, so I thought I knew what Catholic churches were like, but the ones in Mexico looked like birdhouses on Christmas trees. It was hard to take anything seriously – everything was like a toy, even their places of worship.
    
    ‘But so, we were driving along these cliffs, and we smashed into the back of a car that had smashed into another car, one after the other, all crumpled into each other, with smoke everywhere, dust, horns blaring, people yelling, dogs barking. This is how I remember it. Somehow, I’m seeing it from an aerial view, which of course I couldn’t have had.
    
    ‘I was wearing my seat belt, and it snapped my stomach. I thought I was going to throw up. I remember the sound, like a smack, like someone slapping both your ears at once. I guess we were the last in the pile-up. There were cars driving around us. We played a game, guessing the color of the next one to pass by.
    
    ‘We waited there for hours, in the heat, with no AC. Eventually the police came, and a tow truck, and pulled us all apart one by one, and my dad had to speak with someone in his terrible Spanish. It was dark by the time we could be towed away, back in the direction we’d come from. We ended up staying in the same motel we’d left that morning, and I think that was the end of the trip. The car was a rental, so who knows what returning it was like. I can’t remember that part at all.
    
    ‘What I remember the most vividly is the ride in the tow truck, up in the front seat, all of us squished together and silent, except the driver speaking into his radio. We had to go past all the busted cars to get onto another highway. It went from bad to worse; the crash at the front was just twisted metal. It wasn’t obvious what had caused the original collision, or even which cars were involved; they were so, so torn up.
    
    ‘There was an ambulance that must have come from the other way, and it was just then lifting someone inside, and that’s the part that horrified me, that I’d been trying to kill time, lying on a big rock in the shade, and meanwhile there was someone down the road maybe bleeding to death. Then I really thought I’d throw up. It made no sense, why our car got taken care of before that person was in a hospital. There must have been many, many serious injuries. Maybe deaths.
    
    ‘I saw this big group of people – all ages, old, babies, everyone – some lying on blankets on the dirt, some sitting in strollers and wheelchairs. It was dark but I could see blood on clothes, makeshift bandages and slings. They were lit by our headlights. The red glow of the ambulance made everything look bloody. All the cars were bright colors – not like here. I was in a T-shirt and shorts, but everyone else was dressed for winter. It sounds bad, but I remember there were people dressed as clowns – some kind of traditional thing, I think. But in full costume, with makeup, noses, ruffled collars.’
    
    Nance started to laugh. Heath caught Matt’s eye, and they laughed too, looking over at Don, who was looking away, smiling. It was a long joke, Heath decided, having stopped listening halfway through. Clowns in Mexico.
    
    ‘It sounds funny, but it wasn’t funny at all,’ said Leandra. ‘It’s a terrible memory I have.’
    
    Everyone else was cracking up. Was there any more beer? No, but someone had seen a fifth of vodka in the back of a cabinet. They decided it would not be a bad idea to open it and replace it with a new bottle before leaving. Leandra was being gently hazed, but it would do her and her relationship good, Heath decided, to have something to recover from once they all went their separate ways. He took out his phone and texted the girl that he’d be back the day after next. They arranged to meet at a bar near his place that night.
    
     
    
    ‘We almost died,’ said Heath, handing the girl a drink, something she’d ordered off a cardstock menu. It came in a beveled glass, garnished with what looked like a pine-tree clipping. She sipped, let a smile start, then sucked the corners of her mouth in to show she was paying attention. Heath set his glass of beer on a paper coaster. ‘Yeah. If there had been a car behind us, that would have been it. A huge pileup. Probably many deaths.’
    
    ‘But you aren’t hurt?’ She looked at the door, then back at
    Heath, again smiling, then biting the insides of her cheeks, ‘No one got hurt?’
    
    ‘A total miracle.’
    
    ‘How’d you get back?’
    
    ‘I took a bus. They – my friends – were afraid of driving the whole way without getting the car looked at, so they went to a mechanic out there.’
    
    He had vowed not to, but he ended up telling her everything: Don’s ostensible indiscretion, Nance’s overblown reaction, the fogginess of the ensuing trip. All reunions perspire with their own suppressed histories, but this was extreme: a suppression of the most recent of histories, an exaggeration of his own fifth-wheel status.
    
    He told her about Matt’s girlfriend, who was nice, and who had no idea. He told her that time had started to feel stretchy, every moment embedded in those before it, or wrapped around itself like a crescent roll, not flat and pointed like a triangle of dough.
    
    The weekend had been an exercise in restraint. When they arrived, everyone claimed their rooms and then explored the house, hunting out their own corners. Heath sought out the grill, making sure it was dry and had enough propane. When he wandered back inside, he found Nance perched over a glass table covered in jigsaw pieces. On the box was a still life of a bird skull and a glass bell jar placed atop yellowing pages covered in scribbled non-words. She frowned, picking up one tiny piece and attempting to fit it into another. Over the following days, the puzzle took up hours of their time. Everyone, even Don, joined her in constructing the border, but by the end of the trip, it wasn’t even half completed.
    
    ‘I just went along with everything,’ said Heath.
    
    ‘What?’ the girl asked.
    
    ‘Not my place to intervene.’
    
    ‘Why not?’
    
    ‘It’s awful, the way these people can’t communicate correctly.’
    
    ‘Correctly,’ she repeated.
    
    Heath watched her eyes narrow, saw female alliance express itself. ‘It’s sad,’ he said.
    
    ‘Are you going to vote?’ she asked.
    
    ‘I’m sorry, were we talking about politics?’
    
    ‘No. I’m curious.’
    
    ‘It’s just crazy,’ said Heath. ‘I almost died.’ That was the problem. That no one was ever really listening to what he was saying or trying to say. He drained the last of his beer, and without knowing if he would leave the bar altogether or simply detour to the men’s room and come back to this table, new subject in mind, he stood up and wandered away."

    "title": "Obituary of a Soft Porn Translator",

    "text": "Emily St George died thinking of oysters. The obituary writer didn’t know this, of course.

    What the obituary dictated was that Emily St George passed away at the age of fifty-seven, while on a short-lived vacation to a coastal town in Brittany, during the month of March. The writer indulged in descriptions of Emily’s ‘lunar’ skin under an ‘ephemeral’ muslin shirt, and it was these allusions to chilly Brittany, as well as to her inadequate clothes, that meant the newspaper accidentally captured Emily St George’s final mental state. Emily St George died of a heart attack buying oysters at a market stand, died thinking of oysters while buying six of them: no wonder she was a translator, but usually Emily St George was very careful in avoiding literalisms and easy metaphors.
    
    At half past noon, she told the vendor that she wanted to eat them on the beach, sitting on her flimsy folding chair while facing the ocean. She wished she had a wooden chair rather than a plastic one – nobody told her what the March wind could be like in Brittany. She had only ever travelled there in the summer, and according to what the oyster vendor told the obituary writer, she looked flustered, as if she had just pulled out patches of hair. The vendor was sorry about her death and also about the wind. He wished foreigners knew better.
    
    Oyster was a disturbing word for Emily St George. It forced her to think of translation, her longstanding occupation, as well as the recent change in her circumstances. As the obituary carefully noted, Emily St George was known among her inner circle for being an inveterate translator of romance novels from English into Italian. The newspaper didn’t cover the fact that lately work had dried up and Emily had started discussing the terms of her early retirement with her accountant. She had flown to Brittany because she didn’t want to acknowledge that fact either. The Italian publishing house was really sorry, they valued Emily’s contribution over the years, but they couldn’t keep flooding newsstands with pocket romances. Demand was changing, new trends were emerging overseas.
    
    Had the newspaper cared enough about Emily’s life to publish a more accurate obituary, surely a less poetic one, the editors would have learned that according to her many friends, Emily St George never traveled off season. The real motive behind the six oysters for lunch, the choice of coastal location in late winter, and the subsequent extreme wind on the day of her death, could be traced back to a phone call Emily had taken with her publisher one day in early February. After the call was over she’d started firing off texts to her friends right away, overcoming her secret shame and fear of being at fault in the whole matter. Her fear that her work had gone out of fashion. The recurring nightmare that an aging translator was like a glass of natural wine before it became widely popular.
    
    The taste of her translations must have gone musty and funky but no one had the guts to say so and pretended to like her wine out of politeness. On the other hand, not all translations were supposed to be palatable. In the case of old-fashioned romance novels, Emily knew that too much attention to style and language could spoil the product and take away the fun. Those books were supposed to be rancid.
    
    While speaking to her former publisher, Emily St George didn’t mention natural wines at all and was quite distressed to learn that the publication of pocket romances (or soft porn novels, if she was being honest) would drop from twenty-four to eight releases a month. These would no longer be short books meant to be read on the train or at the beach, but ‘proper’ novels with respectable layouts and hardback covers written by a new generation of diverse authors who were well-read and almost always online. This new arrangement called for fewer translators, and Emily St George was aware that she was not going to fit into the downsized team. Her translation style was too correct, which was fine by the new publishing standards, but as her correctness didn’t flow from her political consciousness or activism – being a side effect of her own education – it sounded rather boring. She was also aware that she was no longer suited for the job she thought she loved. Over the past few years, Emily had been invited to several panels on the impact of AI on translation, but she knew perfectly well that aging and the publishing industry were her enemies, not the machines. Machines were the conveyers of hostile ideas shaped by evil human beings and she resented facile AI polemicists with her whole heart. She stopped reading their circular long-form essays on the subject, none of them provided new ideas anyway.
    
    Emily St George had always maintained a deeply organic approach to translation. She was very intentional about this word, organic: she would read the whole text first and establish the tone, each linguistic nuance blooming from the other. Soft porn novels didn’t often require such finesse, but she had integrity.
    
    She understood the basic tropes of romance writing very quickly. At the beginning sex was landscape. Pleasure was in the valleys, in moderate climbs, it was found in the peaks and crests and tender buds of female breasts and vaginas. Women were mountains and men were rocks, orgasms were earthquakes, eruptions of liquid fire and thundering storms, and every piece of land, in the end, was colonized and spent. Cocks were trunks, desire was windy and watery, sex was usually a boat that would set sail after a few seconds ago, only to come back five pages later. There was never much in the way of narrative in the sorts of romances Emily translated.
    
    Then sex became food. It was juices, ripples, bites, peels, torn skins, scratches and savory drops. Bottoms were silky peaches and lips became cherries. Not that Emily St George ever reduced herself to using an eggplant or a banana, in real sex or otherwise, but in her own experience as a woman, fruit metaphors came in handier, and somehow felt more relevant to her daily life, or more accurately, to her memories of what real sex was all about.
    
    This penchant for fruit and vegetable metaphors had something to do with the very reason why she decided to become a translator. She had a good story about that – the obituary writer would have loved it.
    
    Back in 1984, over spring break, Emily St George took a painful trip to Tuscany with her parents, both of whom were artists. Her mother wore denim overalls and a brown bandana like a strawberry picker, and since she was bilingual – English and Italian – she flaunted her worldliness during minor daily interactions which often required no talking at all, just a brief exchange of money. Her mother’s abundant compliments with the market vendors made Emily feel sick and hide behind any stand she could find. One day this happened in a secondhand bookshop, where Emily found a copy of La luna e i falò by Cesare Pavese with a pastoral illustration on the cover. She opened it and read the epigraph: ‘For C. Ripeness is all’. Later she found out that the quote came from King Lear, yet this seemed irrelevant to her. Even the dedication to an American actress who dumped Pavese at some point felt strangely uninteresting. Ripeness was the word that did it for Emily St George: she imagined foreign words as mature fruits hanging from a tree, something she had to pick carefully; each fruit so ready to be tasted but also close to bursting. Handling her Italian, imagining the language as a peach or a fig, she felt the risk of overdoing it, of spilling juice all over the place. As a translator himself, Pavese must have known this feeling. Sure, he was very preoccupied with sex, but he was also a poet, a thinker. Dirty and sexy enough to have ripeness in his mind when writing that epigraph, but not surprising at all, in the end. Apparently, Pavese couldn’t get it up and compensated for his frustration with his pen.
    
    After that trip, Emily spent all of her following summers attending language classes in Italy, eventually she read all of Pavese and learned a lot about how to handle a character as if they were a landscape. She was taken by the abundance of rural images, the grapes, the grass and the open fields, which he used to characterize the cast of his novels. She felt bound for a sophisticated career, ready to honor her mother’s linguistic abilities in a more useful and practical manner, not for personal vanity but for the sake of literature, while helping the anglophone world become less monolingual and stiff. Despite these great expectations, how she ended up translating soft porn was not really a mystery.
    
    She had been pitching serious Italian writers to several publishers, especially dead women or lesser known losers, but that market was already taken. Those titles were dominated by serious translators, while she had no proper training and needed a job. Then, in the early nineties, she met a woman working for a publisher based in Milan interested in translating English pocket romances and her career finally took off; she learned fast in patterns and synonyms. She realigned her expectations and by Pavese’s age at the time of his premature death, Emily St George had translated an insane number of valleys, cherries, sails and thunderstorms, delivering twelve or fifteen books per year, for almost twenty-five years. She became a reliable mediator, hiding behind solid pseudonyms in case the name of the translator would be mentioned at all on the edition.
    
    Over time, her geopolitics improved. The early Saudi Arabian, Midwestern and ranch scenes moved to contemporary Europe and Japan. Still, Emily St George’s favorite translations were set on farms. The scenes of delivering cattle took the sexual edge off, they were bloody and phlegmatic and tested her rhythm and talent. She had a real issue with women’s broken careers: she hated retired ballerinas and anchorwomen moving inland. Usually these women were looking for Christmas in little arts and crafts markets on a Sunday morning and found Republican politics instead.
    
    Before she left for her final vacation in Brittany, Emily bought two books from a new generation of writers and translators. As she began reading, she suddenly realized what was happening in these books: sex was just sex. It had nothing to do with climate or orchards. Cocks were cocks and cunts were cunts. As for the geography, the world had shrunk: no one was traveling, chartering or navigating new terrain anymore, it was a lot of college or backyard drama. A lot of BDSM. Verbs were restored to their original density: spanking and hammering. If anything, it was like a porn video set in a little hardware shop, slightly mechanical and a little too literal. Nobody was smoking or eating a steak with a malevolent glare in front of a chimney. Smells changed. Whisky was banned. There was a lot of music, very specific music: not simple genres like adult-oriented rock or soft jazz, but proper songs and bands that apparently everyone was familiar with, everyone except Emily. Lots of ellipses, but not in descriptions about fucking, never there. Even in the songs mentioned in the books, figurative language had become a chimera.
    
    She could admit the plots were better. But were these books getting anyone off, or making them cry, which is what often happened to Emily. Just days before she died, Emily had been reading in her flimsy chair, facing the ocean, as sex became orthopedic. Hours went by and sex was geometry. Women had careers again. Men were often going through a phase. They were fragile. Women had friends now, they were no longer segregated in cabins under a blizzard. They were called Dolores or Layla. They were escaping Christmas, then looking for Christmas again, then converting to Korean housekeeping. They no longer cared about pumpkins and apples but were into specialty coffees with powdered herbs inside. They had good politics, they had their hearts broken, but then they made speedy recoveries. Happiness was usually reached when subs realized they were really doms and doms became asexual: sex died in bureaucracy.
    
    This was not the first time Emily St George had had a career crisis. In 2004, she turned to crime novels for a while, but she couldn’t handle the formulaic plots: every time you kill a girl in that kind of story, she is already dead. She felt dirty and gave up quickly, told no one about it.
    
    She went back to her soft porn and when she found the word ‘zephyr’ to describe the color of a pool in Bali, she felt so content that she reached out to the author to thank him. To her, that lexical choice was equal to Fitzgerald’s usage of pink in the Côte d’Azur in Tender Is the Night. Some of the authors cared, and Emily exchanged nice emails with them, but that was when sex was still hidden behind sex.
    
    ‘She looked as if she had been pulling out chunks of her hair’ the oyster vendor kept saying to anyone asking after Emily’s heart attack. As she lay dying among the fish juices dripping from the vendor’s cart, Emily St George thought it had been a long time since she’d made proper use of an oyster in a translation.
    
    Oysters used to be very popular in genitalia analogies, although using ‘ostrica’ for vagina sounded bad in Italian, not representative enough, so clitorises became pearls. They were gone now too. Sex had once been a jewelry store, a jewelry store built on top of a fishery.
    
    Immobilized on the floor outside the oyster cart, Emily’s mind was racing along the hysterical pumping of her heart; the fluids around her smelled so bad, like sex gone wrong with a philandering corsair in the eighteenth century, but the pools of liquid glistened under the midday sun as if precious: iridescent, speckled, somehow revolting in their ephemeral colors. Not that she would know it exactly, but it was a common mistake to think that a translator should have firsthand knowledge of what they are translating. Much like the sexless authors of many great erotic novels, it was all a matter of imagination. And Emily was great at that. The only thing she remembered about that time she had sex with an older man, a friend of her father’s, was precisely that disgusting transcendence, something slippery inside her throat, wanting it to end as quick as possible, but still savoring that bitterness later at dinner, a sensorial oxymoron that she carried forever within her memories. A disgusting pleasure.
    
    Someone in her family decided that she should wear white in her coffin. When Emily was still alive various family members had speculated on her virginity as much as teenage critics had speculated on Pavese’s impotence. Little did they know, and Emily never contradicted them, too busy with work and with friends. A mean cousin, the one she never liked, believed her body inside the casket still gave off a fish smell, but it was only the overripe flowers. The obituary opted for an unnecessary flourish by indicating that unlike in crime stories, at least in romance novels women never died and somehow Emily St George would stay immortal in their imaginary lives. By no means a sentimental person, Emily St George would have agreed with that from her premature funeral in that windy coastal town. And when a thunderstorm broke over her relatives and friends staring at the coffin, it was felt that she deserved it: hadn’t she set sail on the most perilous journey of all, climbing endless stairs of ecstasy, only to be showered with the infinite light of God, in the realm where no geography or genders could be bound and gagged by language, forced to submit to the specter of a dominant culture? Finally unburdened by the torments of translation, Emily died happy and free.

    "text": "The time had come to freeze my eggs. Before I did that, I needed to see Cameron. Those days I was prone to bouts of socially inappropriate laughter that veered into even less appealing sobs. I wasn’t ashamed. My mother had died in a terrible accident and if I neglected to have a child someday soon-ish I would never again know real, abiding love. Cameron and I were in touch intermittently, saw each other every few years, and on the fourth of September I started my period and gave him a call. He and his carpenter wife Stephanie welcomed me into their home exactly two weeks later.

    ‘You’re in a PhD program?’ Stephanie passed me the carton of beef lo mein. For my visit they had ordered takeout, albeit the expensive kind from a restaurant you could read about in the newspaper. They lived in Brooklyn with their two small children. In his emails over the decades, Cameron had made clear they lived ‘hand to mouth’, meaning on an annual income considered kingly in New Haven.
    
    ‘And you build furniture.’ I hoped we could get this part out of the way quickly. I disliked the helplessness that washed over people when I recited the title of my dissertation or tried to explain what linguistics was.
    
    ‘Well, I restore vintage pieces.’ Stephanie wore a chambray shirt and her short hair in stubby braids. She had permanent podcast voice.
    
    Cameron said, ‘Steph scrounges estate sales for mid-century stuff that’s been beat to shit, then she fixes it up and re-sells it for ten times what she paid.’
    
    ‘You make it sound crass.’
    
    ‘Nothing crass about it. Beautiful business, beautiful work.’
    
    Pleased, Stephanie rolled her eyes. ‘What are you writing on?’
    
    Cameron answered for me. ‘The semantic effects of throat-clearing across romance languages.’
    
    ‘Seriously?’ Stephanie said.
    
    ‘Not just throat-clearing,’ I clarified. ‘Also filler words. Like uh, um, like. The French euh, the Italian ehm, and so on.’ I looked at Cameron. ‘I’m impressed you remember.’
    
    I had been in love with Cameron since we were teenagers. He had nary an artsy nor bookish bone in his body. In high school he listened to Jon Bon Jovi’s solo albums and played ultimate frisbee. After graduating two years ahead of me, he joined a frat at Cornell, and after college he got a job at Merrill Lynch. Cameron was kind and courteous. He was handsome not in fact but in character, his sleeves always rolled precisely to his elbows, his clean smiles like beacons of approval. In pictures on the internet he threw his children toward the clouds, certain of their swift return to his steady arms.
    
    The children were in bed. We’d met briefly. When I arrived at the apartment and called them by their names, they corkscrewed their faces and asked, ‘How do you know our names?’ Lila and Otis weren’t impressed by the number of years I’d allegedly known Daddy. Nothing prior to their birth really counted. Why would it?
    
    ‘I was sorry to hear about your mother,’ Stephanie said.
    
    ‘We’re both so sorry,’ Cameron said. ‘I saw you together in a restaurant once. That Italian place by 287.’ He and I were from Tarrytown, meaning we had to travel ridiculously far before we could claim to have grown up in the city. ‘Like an Olive Garden but not a chain? I remember thinking oh, so that’s where Lillian gets her beauty.’
    
    That he referenced my beauty in front of his wife astonished me. Stephanie wasn’t astonished. She ate a fried shrimp and demurely pulled the tail from her teeth.
    
    ‘My beauty? My hair, anyway.’
    
    ‘Your beautiful hair,’ Stephanie confirmed.
    
    All three of us drank London Sours. Cameron loved a fun cocktail. ‘You know, it’s weird.’ A primal vulnerability tore through me. ‘Since she died, I’ve become fixated on having biological children. Sooner rather than later, although I’d like a husband.’
    
    When we were kids, Cameron often called me dazzling. A real charmer. Even then I knew he meant kind of a freak.
    
    ‘Oh?’ Stephanie was Brooklyn-intrigued, fertility discourse her jam.
    
    ‘I always used to think, no shame in being thirty-five and unpartnered. I actually imagined it was ideal to grow up first. Become less of a child myself. Less insufferable in general.’
    
    ‘Absolutely,’ Stephanie said.
    
    ‘I thought I could always adopt if I had to. But after my mom died it was like, bio or bust!’ Here’s where I laughed too hard. ‘I have some money now, from the life insurance. I’ve done the bloodwork and the initial ultrasound. My numbers are good. I might start next month.’ Here’s where I began to weep.
    
    The table was made from an asymmetrical slab of polished wood. A jumble of Lego and Magna-tiles had been pushed aside to make room for dinner. Stephanie said, ‘Have you considered a sperm donor? It’s cheaper, and you could start trying right away.’
    
    ‘Babe.’ Cameron gave his wife a menacing look he’d never once given me.
    
    ‘What? Lillian seems to know what she wants.’
    
    ‘She just told us she doesn’t want to be a single mom. She’s still in school. She’s still young!’
    
    ‘Women don’t lose their viability the moment they have kids—’
    
    ‘Her soulmate could be out there.’
    
    ‘And if she’s already a mom he’s going to, what? Run in the opposite direction?’
    
    ‘Babe, don’t be obtuse. You know everything’s harder for single mothers.’
    
    ‘I’ve heard that, yes.’
    
    ‘But sometimes you wonder?’
    
    There was a fraught silence. I forked a dumpling and said, ‘I actually would consider a sperm donor.’ I chewed and swallowed. ‘If I knew the guy.’
    
    Neither of them had a response to that. Whether my ambitions were transparent or opaque, I was too drunk to know. Halfway through our fourth round, approaching the time I should have left, Stephanie asked if I still spoke to Lucas.
    
    In high school, Lucas had kept a lock of my hair tucked inside his wallet next to a condom I’d promised him we’d use the night of our junior prom, knowing we wouldn’t make it that far. He was two years younger than Cameron, same as me, and objectively the hotter sibling. It was Cameron who’d set us up, presumably sensing my attachment to himself and wanting me around without wanting me. I cooperated. For the entirety of tenth grade, I dated Cameron’s joint-rolling, Gertrude Stein-reading, ponytailed little brother. ‘You’re perfect for each other,’ Cameron often marveled, and I agreed the situation was near perfect. Their parents invited me on family vacations and ordered me a sixteenth birthday cake from the bakery on Broadway. As Lucas’s girlfriend, I enjoyed unfettered access to Cameron as mentor and confidante, had countless opportunities to wander into his room, flop atop his unmade bed and groan with teenage angst. Together the brothers drove me to school, picked me up from French club on Tuesdays, Latin on Thursdays, and consoled me when I fought bitterly with my mom. If we were ever apart, like on a Sunday morning or the occasional federal holiday, they’d pass the phone back and forth, seamlessly sharing one half of our unending conversation. I made out with Lucas only, slipped a hand past the waistband of only Lucas’s boxers, but the boys used the same laundry detergent. It was easy to pretend.
    
    I broke up with Lucas in August, the day Cameron left for Cornell.
    
    As an adult, I became a decent person. For my friends I could be attentive and selfless. When I wanted to activate my goodness, I channeled Cameron – all those welcoming smiles, his habit of appearing equal parts charmed by and concerned about everyone he met. Still, I understood my isolation at thirty-five as a meandering, indirect result of how I’d treated Lucas in high school. Every man I’d been with since was tainted by the same second-bestness, that quality of near-perfection I’d inflicted on my first boyfriend. Twenty years had passed and I understood Cameron and I were incompatible, barely knew each other. I did not believe in wealth management and he did not care about the semantic effects of anything. Our fundamental discordance wouldn’t take a PhD to perceive. And yet, how could I be sure? We never did undress each other. We hadn’t kissed. To this day, when he entered a room, returning with another round of increasingly sour London Sours, my heart expanded.
    
    ‘Lucas doesn’t want to talk to me,’ I said into my drink.
    
    ‘He wanted to marry you,’ Cameron countered.
    
    ‘Wanting to marry someone and wanting to talk to them aren’t the same.’
    
    Stephanie swiveled toward Cameron, like he’d been called to the stand to testify. Cameron yawned and asked if I would stay the night.
    
    ‘I got a room,’ I revealed.
    
    ‘Back to Connecticut in the morning?’ Stephanie asked.
    
    ‘Bright and early.’
    
    ‘Do you read on the train, or—’
    
    ‘No way.’ Cameron winked at me. ‘That’s when she does her scheming.’
    
    Conveniently, as I was pulling on my boots, one of the children unleashed a scream. Stephanie hurried to quiet the woken child before it disturbed the sleeping one. Cameron stooped to offer me a chaste hug, and, into his left ear, I said, ‘I’m staying at Hotel Le Bleu and I don’t need to leave for Grand Central until ten.’
    
    He ran in the mornings. On a Saturday in early September, he might run ten or fifteen miles across the Brooklyn bridge and weave through lower Manhattan. His wife wouldn’t miss him for an hour or even two.
    
    Cameron righted himself. ‘Oh, we have a thing.’ He peered down the dark hallway. We could hear Stephanie whisper-singing ‘Brokedown Palace’ with irritation. ‘I would say breakfast, but the kids have a birthday party.’
    
    I believed him. Still, the next day, I woke early and languished in bed until the minute I had to check out of my room. Just in case Cameron changed his mind and jogged to my hotel and quietly impregnated me.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Initially, when injecting myself with a collection of bawdily-named medications, I felt resourceful and self-reliant, unafraid to pinch my stomach and plunge the thirty-gauge needle into my flesh. I played a YouTube video of a lady performing the same procedure on herself for company. We cursed as our needles went in, whimpered as we eased them out. Wasn’t it empowering? That we could doctor ourselves, harvest ourselves, duplicate ourselves. We didn’t need husbands – or, we did, but in our own sweet time.
    
    Then my ovaries ballooned, became painful to the touch. My head hurt. My abdomen swelled and hardened like I was pregnant already, but I wasn’t and might never be. Bowel movements became a memory. I stopped answering texts, skipped a department potluck, avoided my dissertation and let my laptop die. Warned not to exert myself, I stayed in my third-floor apartment with its fridge in its living room and lay belly-down on the couch, hands beneath my hipbones to keep my inflamed reproductive organs from getting smashed against the cushions. I stayed like that for days, leaving only for ultrasound appointments and to collect the food I ordered but couldn’t bring myself to eat.
    
    Surgery should have meant the end of my suffering, at least psychologically, but it was only the beginning. My numbers were indeed good. ‘We got twenty-seven,’ the nurse said the moment I could process language again.
    
    ‘That’s promising, right?’
    
    ‘At your age, it’s a windfall. You shouldn’t have to go through this again.’
    
    I laughed, then wept.
    
    My cab driver, an older woman, wore solar system leggings and didn’t ask about my health. Coming home to the bathroom trashcan full of used syringes, the couch bearing the depression of my prostrate form, was nearly unendurable. I had no one to take care of me. The cramps started and did not ease for a week.
    
    I thought if the pain had been the consequence of pregnancy or birth, that would be okay; the pain would be a sacrifice and a victory. But this pain marked my mistakes. This pain stripped the world of its sheen and left behind a joyless haze. I hated myself for being alone, for being fertile or not fertile, biologically female, biological, logical enough to plan for the future, insane enough to beg another woman’s husband to relieve me of the chore, to have failed to captivate Cameron when I had my chance with him, to have discarded his brother, to have discarded every man after him.
    
    Eleven days post-retrieval I took a laxative and temporarily found God. On the twelfth day the cramping ceased and I got my period. I called Lucas. He lived in New Jersey now and was perhaps still devoted to me. Did he want to visit that weekend?
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    We met at the German bar on Chapel Street where people in my program went to witness one another thriving, or surviving, or alive. Lucas rested his hand on a volume of Knausgaard’s struggle. His train book, he said. He was still stoned and ponytailed but no longer the objectively hotter sibling. Time is not kind to the bookish, I’ve realized. We ordered beers, and Lucas leaned over our candlelit table to kiss me lightly on the mouth. Having begun a new, unmodified menstrual cycle, I was free to drink, smoke, fuck, whatever it was I normally did with my body. My precise goals were obscure to me, or maybe not obscure but absurd: I wanted to get back together with Lucas, or I wanted to apologize, sincerely, for ever having been with him. Maybe both.
    
    Like Cameron always said, we were perfect for each other. For about an hour I thought I might redeem myself by falling in love with Lucas for real. We talked about the last twenty years: his brief, post-Wesleyan flirtation with heroin, then with antiquarian bookselling, then a PhD in comparative literature from Columbia followed by a prestigious postdoc at Princeton. He didn’t tell me he was sorry my mother had died. I mentioned her terrible accident and he lowered his gaze and nodded to indicate he, too, knew tragedy and grief, that two souls aligned as ours needn’t speak words as trite as sorry. This was a move deployed exclusively by people who had never lost anything – but I let it slide. We gossiped about Cameron, that normie bastard. With his carpenter wife and his Gowanus condo.
    
    ‘I saw them last month,’ I said.
    
    ‘I heard. I’m surprised Steph let you in the house. She’s so jealous of anyone Cam’s ever been, like, affiliated with.’
    
    ‘She can be tense,’ I allowed.
    
    ‘I love my brother, but I couldn’t live that life. She’s got him by the balls. Every time I call Cam he’s taking his kids to the allergist.’
    
    ‘Do you want children, though?’
    
    Lucas laughed, then grimaced, like I’d said something unpleasant yet inevitable yet kind of hot.
    
    ‘Sorry,’ I said. ‘I’ve become obsessed with reproduction.’
    
    ‘I know.’
    
    Of course he knew, and abruptly I wanted to not be where I was. To be transported to an airport bar or the DMV. Mortified, I played dumb. ‘Excuse me?’
    
    ‘Cameron warned me you might try this. And listen—’
    
    ‘No,’ I said. ‘No, no. I froze my eggs.’
    
    Lucas cleared his throat. ‘You did?’
    
    ‘That what I was trying to tell you.’
    
    Quietly, as if betrayed, Lucas said, ‘My brother made it sound like you were desperate for another way. I can’t believe you went through with all that.’
    
    ‘Well, I’m almost thirty-six. And I still might find someone.’
    
    ‘Wow.’ Lucas grabbed the candle from the center of our wobbly table, became fascinated by the flame.
    
    ‘The retrieval was pretty recent. I’m still recovering.’
    
    ‘I could never do it that way.’
    
    ‘What way?’
    
    ‘In a lab. The whole test tube baby thing. I don’t fuck with that.’
    
    Here is where my laughter became cold.
    
    ‘Even ethically – like, you might end up with more embryos than you’ll use? And then you just throw them out?’
    
    ‘You donate them to research.’
    
    He shook his head. ‘I just think, like, if I ever have children, I want them conceived the old-fashioned way. Two people fucking in love, in a bed. Exchanging their actual bodily fluids, you know?’
    
    ‘I was a test tube baby.’
    
    ‘Come on. That sci-fi shit didn’t exist yet.’ Lucas drained his beer.
    
    ‘It was early days, but it existed. My mom was forty and single. She used a sperm bank and did IVF.’
    
    In the orangey glow of the bar, Lucas looked depleted but not sorry. ‘Okay. I obviously didn’t know that. But it’s not, like, a judgement on your humanity. It’s just not what I want for my family.’
    
    I was determined to be decent to him, so I facilitated another ten minutes of useless, low stakes chitchat before suggesting we close our tab. The bar was crowded and we waited for the check. Standing so close to Lucas, among all the cheerfully drunken graduate students who had yet to realize they were running out of time, I felt no attachment to him. My loneliness was acute.
    
    ‘Why did you come here if you thought I wanted you to get me pregnant?’
    
    He pretended not to hear, forcing me to repeat history’s most humbling question. I stood on my toes and half shouted. Lucas blinked and I realized two things: first, that he truly hadn’t heard me, and second, that he would have done it.
    
    I walked him to the train station. Lucas punched me gently on the arm to say goodbye. We wouldn’t see each other again in our lifetimes if we could help it.
    
    I was two miles from my apartment. I walked on, hungry for the exercise, the still novel absence of pain. My mother had been walking home from the Tarrytown Metro North station when a delivery van turned left on red, struck and killed her. Our relationship had been ordinary, meaning we didn’t get along and she was the person I loved most in the world. I found it extremely difficult to live without her love – which was why my fantasies of motherhood borrowed nothing material from my childhood and hinged instead on the promise of no longer being alone.
    
    In a few years I would pay a surgeon to slip one of my perfectly preserved, fertilized eggs inside my uterus. Pregnancy would rouse my senses, render me alert and animal to the world. I would labor heroically, as all women must. I believed my daughter would open her eyes and understand we belonged together. She would be affectionate and confident and have my hair. Growing up, she might resent my lack of social graces, my constant throat-clearing ending in blunt propositions. Well into her adolescence I would try to hold her hand when we crossed the street. She would hate that, and still she would know things about me no one else knew: that I rub my feet together before I fall asleep and immediately upon waking. That my dreams are often in the wrong language: a New Haven bus driver yelling at me in French, a lover soothing me in Spanish. That I prefer a small, clean home to a large, disordered one. That I am forever torn between spontaneity and all my careful plans.
    
    Of course, pregnancy was hell and childbirth the single most harrowing experience of my life – but I was right about everything else."

    "text": "I tell Ma that I’m feeling old, that I think I might finally be

    an old woman.
    
    I say it to say something.
    
    Ma says nothing.
    
    I imagine it’s hard for Ma to think of me as an old woman as
    
    that would mean that she would be very old.
    
    And quite understandably she doesn’t like the idea of being a
    
    very old woman because this is not something she ever had
    
    in mind for herself.
    
    But we cannot get away from it. The fact of her being a very
    
    old woman.
    
    I know how old she is because every time I look at her, I
    
    think of how I’ll kiss her closed eyes and be among those to
    
    watch her body as it’s lowered into the ground.
    
    Even though in reality that may not be what happens
    
    because Ma might well have her own plans which have yet to
    
    be revealed. And I think I’m happy to not press Ma for what
    
    it is she wants in the circumstances.
    
    You might think, given where we are, that every day would
    
    be precious but we are beyond that.
    
    That is how old she is.
    
    But there’s another woman who is even older than Ma, who
    
    is in fact the oldest woman in the world, who lives in Japan
    
    and no, she doesn’t want to carry the flame at the Olympic
    
    Opening Ceremony. Let some other old woman do it, she
    
    says, tucking into her miso soup with a hunger that is both
    
    delicate and voracious.
    
    Is that her secret, I wonder.
    
    This is all I want, the old woman says, nodding at her soup,
    
    slurping one spoonful after another.
    
    But I don’t believe her.
    
    I think she says this because she is the oldest woman alive
    
    and can say whatever she likes.
    
    I think what she really wants is to die but to say that would
    
    be a terrible shame.
    
    For us, I mean.
    
    We love that we have found someone we can call the oldest
    
    woman alive.
    
    We love that all she wants is to eat soup.
    
    We find her frugality charming.
    
    But maybe what she wants is to confound us with her
    
    apparent lack of desire. Maybe she’s had enough of our
    
    attention and silliness, our endless talk of the flame.
    
    But it doesn’t matter what she wants as live on is what she
    
    does, eating soup and avoiding the telephone.
    
    Like Ma.
    
    I like to rub Ma’s feet. The toes bunch together and curl
    
    under slightly. I take one foot and with my thumb press
    
    gently along the white tendons that splay out beneath the
    
    skin like brief, bony rays of light.
    
    Sometimes I want to ask Ma if things matter less the older
    
    you get, but know I won’t get a straight answer.
    
    We sit and watch the birds who have taken the place of our
    
    feelings.
    
    Every morning they hop here and there looking for food.
    
    Once a bird flew straight at our window.
    
    I stood and watched it lying there on the ground.
    
    Next time I looked it was gone.
    
    More than anything I don’t want her to be afraid.
    
    I stand up and say: Time for soup!
    
    Our meals have become very regular and important and
    
    what we eat has become one of the things Ma seems happy
    
    to talk about. We talk about what we’re going to have, what
    
    we’re having while we’re having it and then afterwards, what
    
    it was we had. Each meal contains a past, present and a
    
    future so that we can for a while forget about other things.
    
    I think there is still love between me and Ma but we are so
    
    easily distracted by the birds.
    
    And the soup she likes that I make.
    
    I hold up a plastic bag and say:
    
    Look Ma, they’re selling misshapen carrots in a bag with an
    
    exclamation mark – maybe so we don’t take them too
    
    seriously!
    
    Ma looks at me holding the bag.
    
    She has become extremely calm in the face of all things.
    
    I wonder if this will last.
    
    I wonder if she might be able to tell me what she’s really
    
    feeling. I wonder if it matters. I wonder if it matters whether
    
    the oldest woman in the world doesn’t tell the truth. Perhaps
    
    she’s trying to tell us that in the end these things don’t matter.
    
    That other things do, like the birds.
    
    Once we saw a pigeon with half its wing unfeathered. All
    
    you could see were the white stems but still it strutted
    
    around the patio as if it didn’t know.
    
    Ma looks out the window.
    
    Or perhaps, I say, still holding the bag, they’re telling us we
    
    have nothing to fear!
    
    She might be smiling only it’s hard to tell because her face is
    
    turned towards the birds.
    
    I’d like to be able to say that I can’t wait to get very old but
    
    what I think I mean is that I can’t wait for this to be over.
    
    For Ma.
    
    I don’t mind about the woman in Japan.
    
    She can go on living as long as she likes, eating soup and
    
    refusing to carry the torch."

    "text": "Harper breezes in twenty minutes late with a shiner that takes up half her face. Even though I know better, I wince. The thing is hard to look at, the colors intense as a sunset. Harper’s desk is already set up with a sleek black laptop and the Trigonometry workbook she needs to get through by the end of the shoot, the book open on a page filled with triangles. There’s also a notebook for scratch paper and a row of new mechanical pencils neatly lined up and waiting. Yesterday she was scheduled to be in the trailer for at least three hours. I set her desk up but she never came in.

    Today she throws herself down in her chair, whips out a silver phone, the device barely thicker than a credit card.
    
    ‘You’re late,’ I say. There’s a tech guy in the trailer trying to fix the AC which Brennan’s mother has complained isn’t doing enough. I don’t know why but I want to put on a good show for the techie’s sake. I want him to think my work is important. I want him to think I belong here nestled among the talent. ‘You’re late,’ I repeat.
    
    ‘Take it up with Charlie Brown,’ Harper drawls. She snaps her phone shut and flips me the bird. I hear the techie snigger over his toolbox. He has the cover off the unit and is surrounded by a million thin screws, each one slowly sinking into the plush white wall-to-wall carpet.
    
    ‘Fine,’ I say. It’s not worth getting into it with Harper, especially when she’s in full make-up. I consider reminding her I have the power to close down the set, which would throw a serious financial wrench in everyone’s lives, but I can feel the techie’s eyes knifing me in the back so I decide to be above it all. ‘You need to finish that exercise,’ I say. Harper fires up her computer but I know she’s just checking her money. ‘As in today,’ I say. She’s one of the worst students I’ve ever had. Once she left the screen up on her bank account. I turned it off but not before I saw a double-digit figure followed by six zeros. Harper’s sixteen years old.
    
    Andy leans over in her direction. ‘How many?’ he whispers. Andy’s eighteen with green eyes and a baby smooth face which the ladies in hair and make-up claim he waxes. Word is his agent wants him to stay a kid as long as possible, be the kind of teen heartthrob you might see on the cover of Tiger Beat.
    
    ‘Seventeen takes,’ Harper says. ‘The last one took twenty minutes.’
    
    ‘Fucking A,’ says Andy. Brennan’s mother looks up from her knitting. ‘Sorry,’ he says, and flashes her a thousand-watt smile. Andy’s still a nice kid. He still says please and thank you any time he bums a cigarette. According to his file he’s been doing commercials since he was in diapers, but he landed a role as a homeless teen in last year’s indie hit and he’s been an It kid ever since. This is his first summer blockbuster, his first stint in the on-set school. This spring he’ll graduate back home in Utica with the rest of his class but out here in the desert he needs to stay on top of his coursework. ‘Can’t Charlie Brown get it together?’ Andy says to no one in particular. He begins tapping his pencil on his desk, jiggling his leg up and down. I know he’s hoping to go out later this afternoon with Gorgeous himself. Gorgeous is the movie’s leading man and has all afternoon free, a rarity – he’s practically in every shot – and has promised to take whoever’s around surfing on one of the giant dunes.
    
    ‘They’re way behind schedule,’ says Harper. She takes a long sip from a stainless-steel coffee mug. Last week she spilled it all over my briefcase as she was teetering in, most likely with a hangover, so I know she takes it black. ‘Charlie Brown can’t get his head out of his ass,’ she says. Brennan’s mom doesn’t bother to look up from her knitting, mostly because it’s true. The whole unit is almost a week behind thanks to the second director with the oddly shaped shaved head whom the entire cast and crew now call Charlie Brown thanks to a joke Gorgeous made the first week of production. Any more delays and the crew won’t get a deadline bonus.
    
    Brennan raises her hand. ‘Mr Faino,’ she says, ‘I’m done.’ The kid is a machine. At age six, she’s already doing fourth grade work. At this rate she’ll get through the curriculum by thirteen. The truth is Brennan’s the biggest star in the trailer. She gets at least five million a pic. Rumor has it she didn’t even have to audition for this role which is almost unheard of among child actors. She’s already been in more than twenty movies, movies which have grossed more than a half billion worldwide. On the set, everyone defers to her, even Harper. On Variety’s list of the one hundred most powerful women in Hollywood, Brennan ranks twenty-fourth.
    
    Today both she and Harper are in full period attire, each girl demure in an ankle-length calico dress. They’re supposed to be sisters, the children of missionaries living in nineteenth-century Africa. Andy plays their older brother who stumbles on a treasure map wedged in the eye socket of a human skull. Think Indiana Jones meets The Mummy but for the tween crowd. Throw in Gorgeous as the kids’ father and the studio’s reportedly sinking a hundred million into this one.
    
    Brennan hands her quiz to her mother who looks it over before handing it to me. Sometimes I have a hard time making eye contact with Brennan, her blue eyes big as fists. Off-camera there’s something about her, something alien and cold, like she’s been sent to Earth to study how kids are supposed to act. She reminds me of those baby Jesuses you see in Renaissance paintings, the baby Lord simply a small man with a double chin. Once I saw her holding a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos. She read the serving size, then picked out exactly fourteen chips before handing the bag to her assistant.
    
    I take out a pen and check her quiz, her handwriting in cursive and precise as a laser. It’s a state capitals test. She finished it in under five minutes. I correct one of her answers, then slap a silver star on it. I hand it back, and she sits checking it over like a prospector looking for gold. ‘Mr Faino,’ she says. Her voice is high but poised, controlled, and it finally comes to me, the thing about her voice I’ve been trying to place for the past few weeks. ‘Mr Faino,’ she says again, and I realize that the way she talks – her cadence and inflection, her carefully measured locution – makes her sound exactly like the current Secretary of State. ‘The capital of Kentucky is Frankfort, not Lexington.’
    
    ‘What?’
    
    ‘Frankfort.’ Her mother gives me a steely look, her knitting needles glinting like cutlery. Brennan rehands me her test.
    
    I can just imagine what the techie will tell the other gaffers. ‘Of course,’ I say. ‘Frankfort.’ I don’t even check the answer key. The kid is always right. I lick a gold star, stick it over the silver one, and hand it back. She gives me a look simultaneously filled with derision and pity, her huge blue eyes cold as starlight, a look that completely emasculates me. For the fourth time this week I realize I’m forty-nine years old and this kid could buy and sell me a gazillion times over. I wonder if this is all it’s cracked up to be, teaching the young and famous in a deluxe trailer out in the Namib desert.
    
    Harper’s smirking in her chair. I can tell all she’s done is rename all of the triangles HAM. There’s no way she’s going to get through that workbook, a fact which is actually worse for me than it is for her. I’m about to say something to prod her along but my phone rings and I know the kids are wanted on the set, probably for reshoots. I don’t even bother to answer it. ‘Go ahead,’ I say. ‘See you tomorrow.’
    
    Harper is the first out the door. She leaves a half-eaten candy bar on her keyboard, the chocolate softening in the heat. Andy straightens up his desk, piles some papers in a folder before leaving. Brennan helps her mother wind up the extra yarn, then the kid pulls a sun bonnet out of her mother’s knitting bag and adultly ties it on her own head. She’s not even seven years old and already she’s mindful of sun damage. Neither she nor her mother say goodbye.
    
    The techie has the cover back on the AC. ‘Nice work if you can get it,’ he says, hefting his toolbox. I watch him walk out the door. I wonder who he’s talking about, me or them.
    
    Within minutes the place is an icebox.
    
     
    
     
    
    Though it’s the number one tourist destination in Namibia, there is absolutely nothing to do in Sossusvlei. I sit in my trailer with the door open drinking my second Windhoek Lager. The moon is starting to rise over the dunes. Bill, my roommate, is out doing whatever it is he does. Bill’s with the SPCA and has an ATV because he’s allowed to go anywhere on the set to make sure the animals are being treated okay. Bill’s a young Turk from Seattle and carries around more paperwork with him than I do. I once asked if I could look at some of the forms he has to fill out, but he hugged them to his chest and shook his head. Because I often pick his clothes up off the trailer floor, I know he wears a lot of stuff made from hemp. In the mornings before he heads out on his ATV, he rubs a block of salt under each armpit. In this heat, I’ve noticed it doesn’t seem to work. I’m not sure how we got paired up, but I’d rather room with Bill than with Peckham, the scarab beetle wrangler. The locals hired as housekeepers say Peckham’s trailer has more than ten thousand bugs in it.
    
    I finish my beer and walk outside. There are trailers everywhere, each one neatly lined up on a grid. FEMA eat your heart out. Nobody puts together a temporary city like a movie crew. After Katrina, the federal government should have hired one of the big Hollywood studios to build housing. Throw in some bonuses and there would have been mansions for all within a week.
    
    I slip off my sandals and sink my feet into the still warm sand. During location orientation Mac the Knife said to always wear shoes, especially at night, because of scorpions. Everyone knows all the dos and don’ts they tell you at those things are just for liability reasons. I light a cigarette and start walking. It’s hard to see any stars because of all the klieg lights they’re using two dunes over for a night scene. The generators are running at full capacity. At night anyone who’s not talent has to turn off their air-conditioning. It’s okay with me because the desert night is the best part of the day, the humidity just right, like a warm bath.
    
    The location is about a half hour east of Dune 45, the one you see on all the postcards. There’s a second location stateside in Wilmington but I’m not sure which scenes they’re filming there. I walk ten minutes to where the trailers end. Just over the next dune it’s so bright from the diffusers it looks like daytime. The Namib desert is the oldest desert in the world, the dunes among the highest on earth. During the sunrise the sands are lit a deep blood red, the landscape like something on Mars. A half hour before first light vanloads of tourists show up at Dune 45, have their pictures taken as they march single file up the crest. I hope I get a chance to go before the end of the shoot. Some of the best boys climbed 45 at sunset and said it was all that. The electrical guys always have a nose for cool stuff to do.
    
    Within a day of arriving on location the sand becomes your enemy. At the end of the day you can feel the grit in your teeth; at night in your bed it rubs you raw. It’s all the cinematographers can talk about, the way it scratches their lenses. Still, I like it here. It’s like living in a terrarium, like we’re all just part of one big happy ant colony. It reminds me of the prophets in the Bible living out in the desert eating nothing but locusts and honey. Already I think I’ve lost five pounds. There’s a real simplicity in desert living. At orientation Mac said Namibia’s population density is four people for every square mile. It sure beats Burbank. Burbank with the smog and the tremors and the brush fires and the beautiful women with their fake breasts hard as drywall. Out here at night I can forget the school. I can forget the three kids who collectively are worth fifty million more than me.
    
    I light another cigarette and climb the dune to watch. From the top I can see it’s mostly lighting and the dolly drivers laying down a track. It can take them hours to figure out how to shoot something. Charlie Brown is sitting in the second director’s chair, his big spherical head in profile like Alfred Hitchcock.
    
    I look at my watch. Right now it’s noon in LA. Christina’s probably in Century City at her acting class. She has a thing going with someone in the class – I think he’s Serbian. I know she knows I know. I look at my watch again. Maybe in an hour or so if traffic’s light, they’ll be back at our shitty little apartment in the valley clawing away at each other. I take a long last drag on my cigarette, flick it into the dune grass. Christina’s no spring chicken either though she looks great. She’s almost thirty, which means her big break better come sooner rather than later. Honestly my job is the only reason she sticks around. She thinks being with me gives her ‘access’.
    
    Sometimes I get invited to premieres. I can tell from the way she primps and preens, the tight dresses she wears from boutiques on Melrose, that she’s hoping to be discovered. The first time I took her to an opening I told her not to hold her breath. At Grauman’s Chinese Theater we had to go in the back way with the rest of the non-essentials.
    
    Something has left a track in the sand, a series of tiny footprints the size of dimes. What if I just stay here? It’s six rand to the dollar. Would anyone even miss me? Even my mother has stopped asking how the latest screenplay’s going. Now she just tells all her girlfriends in Phoenix I’m in the industry, production side.
    
    In the distance I hear an engine rev. Slowly it gets louder until I realize something is rumbling up the dune. I turn and see Rainer, the director, on an ATV, his goggles madly glinting in the light. Gorgeous is sitting on the back holding a boogie board, his face so rugged and chiseled it makes my heart pound unwittingly.
    
    ‘Hey, Teacher Man,’ says Rainer. ‘What’s shaking?’ Rainer is from some European principality and never calls anyone by their real name. He’s the reason we all call Charlie Brown Charlie Brown and Gorgeous Gorgeous. On Rainer’s left hand there’s a small MLO tattoo but one of the guys in props said it’s just for show, that a true Malibu surfer would never let a guy like Rainer join. Rainer pulls up alongside me and idles the bike. ‘Howdy,’ I say. ‘Surf’s up?’
    
    Gorgeous pounds the board with his fist. ‘Hella tight,’ he says, which surprises me because nobody uses that word anymore. His hair is streaked gray at the temples to make him look more fatherly. This is the third movie set I’ve been on with him. The first was a romantic comedy he did almost eight years ago, the second a heist flick. Every time I see him I still can’t believe a human being can be so good-looking. Even the union carpenters get giggly when he’s around.
    
    Rainer adjusts his goggles. They make him look like a World War I flying ace. ‘How’re things going in the classroom?’ he asks. Strangely enough the most powerful forces on the set besides Rainer are the SPCA and me. If Bill blows the whistle on animal cruelty, there’ll be hell to pay. If I flunk any of my charges, the flunkee has to stop filming immediately. It can cost a studio millions of dollars a week in delays until the kid gets it together. Most times it’s cheaper to just bring in a replacement and refilm the kid’s part.
    
    ‘Harper’s not going to win any Merit Scholarships anytime soon,’ I say.
    
    ‘She doesn’t need to,’ says Rainer. He winks at me, then puts the bike straight into fifth and hurls the two of them down the dune. I watch them head into the thrum of lights. I think about how if we weren’t here on location, this very spot would be quiet and peaceful, monastic. I think about how I’m almost fifty, my life a series of devaluations – from wannabe actor to wannabe director to wannabe screenwriter to this. I wonder if Rainer knows I’m being investigated. That the LA County Board of Off-Site Learning wants to ask me a few questions. Like why, in the almost one hundred shoots I’ve done in the last ten years, I’ve never failed anyone.
    
    In the distance, Rainer gets off the bike, walks over and rubs Charlie Brown’s globe of a head as if for luck. Suddenly Harper appears from the other side of the dune. I watch her stub out a cigarette, then step on Gorgeous’s board. For a moment she stands balancing precariously, her arms stretched out like wings. Then she bends her knees and silently rockets out of sight.
    
     
    
     
    
    When I get back to the trailer Bill’s already in bed. I can smell patchouli, see a two-dimensional version of Bill strewn on the floor – his khakis, his hemp shirt – as if he melted right out of his clothes. There’s an envelope lying on my pillow. Someone’s already opened it. It’s a printout of an email from Christina. Out here in the desert the non-talent doesn’t have Internet access though I sometimes use the kids’ laptops to check my mail. Otherwise messages are sent to a group address and then delivered to us. The print is light; the machine must be running out of ink. ‘Hey,’ it says. ‘I’m moving in with Slobodan. No hard feelings.’ There’s one of those emoticons at the end but the thing is composed of so many symbols it looks more like an expletive. I lick my fingers and reach over to extinguish the incense sitting in a small altar Bill has brought with him from Seattle. The thing goes out with a satisfying hiss. I pull on a windbreaker and swipe the keys off Bill’s dresser. Outside the moon looks like a hand grenade but without the pin.
    
     
    
     
    
    Ernst’s is a good thirty minutes away. I keep the ATV in second, enjoy the ride. Fifteen minutes out of camp I can see the Southern Cross and the Scorpion, the night sky littered with stars. Four people to every square mile. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad.
    
    I stick to the main track. If I went over the dunes as the crow flies I could get lost out here, end up like Ralph Fiennes in The English Patient, all burned and crispy. The moon lights up the desert, the sands mindless and vast. It’s like being out in the middle of the ocean at night. The way you realize how small you are, that the earth wouldn’t care one bit if something suddenly snuffed you out. I remember after Gordy, my agent, refused to even send around my second screenplay. ‘I got two words for you,’ he said. Through the phone I could hear him munching on something. ‘Move on.’
    
    I pass one of the giant dunes. In the dark it looks prehistoric. After a few minutes I begin to see fires burning up ahead. I pass a campsite and smell marijuana. Someone’s playing Bob Marley through a tinny radio. I wonder what they’d do if they knew some of the biggest movie stars in the world are just up the road. Maybe they wouldn’t care. Maybe the kind of people who trek all the way out here into the desert are beyond such things.
    
    I come to a fork in the road and turn left. Ernst’s is less than half a mile up the track. I pull in and cut the engine. The place looks like a little gingerbread house. For a minute I think I smell bratwurst. In the parking lot there are a number of ATVs and a couple of minivans. Ernst’s is too far for most of the crew to drive all the way out here since they might be needed on the set at a moment’s notice. Even the stuntmen prefer to drink out in front of their trailers where they swap crazy stories of freefalling off hydroelectric dams.
    
    I push open the door. The place is smoky and darkly lit. I walk in and for a second it’s like I’m back in the classroom. Andy’s sitting in a corner drinking a beer and talking intently with a beautiful dark-skinned woman, her head totally shaved. When I enter he looks right at me but doesn’t even smile. I see Harper sitting at the bar, her blonde hair tastefully pulled back in a tight bun. It’s only when I see Brennan holding a pool cue as she sips a scotch that I remind myself I’m in the land of the body double. On this movie, the doubles are uncanny – Brennan’s double puts down her pool stick and picks her cigarette up out of the ashtray where she left it. In the corner Gorgeous is playing darts. If I look closely through the smoky haze I can tell his arms aren’t nearly as ripped as the real Gorgeous.
    
    I walk up to the bar and order a seven and seven. The man behind the counter is wearing a Tyrolean hat and stands drying an enormous beer stein. He puts the stein down and makes me my drink. ‘Ten dohlars,’ he says, then adds, ‘you vit the crew?’ It’s like I’m talking with Schwarzenegger himself.
    
    ‘Yeah,’ I say.
    
    ‘It still ten dohlars,’ he says. That’s colonialism for you. I paw through my wad of colorful money and hand him fifteen. ‘Danke sehr,’ he grunts. At the pool table Brennan’s double makes an incredible shot.
    
    All the body doubles are at least eighteen, even Brennan’s. They all sign strict confidentiality agreements and often follow the star from one film to the next. The resemblance is usually pretty amazing but not so amazing you can’t believe they’re not twins separated at birth. Sometimes a body double is better looking than the star. If that happens, the double usually doesn’t last long.
    
    I take a seat one over from Harper. The real Harper’s already done a stint in AA. Before she broke into film she was a teen pop star. Her biggest hit was a song called ‘Lonely for You’. It’s true, I’m blue, and lonely for you. For three months you couldn’t go anywhere without hearing it. I take a sip and study faux Harper in the mirror behind the bar. Same pouty lips, same emerald eyes. Her face even holds the light the same way, her cheekbones chiseled like a deer’s. After a while I realize I’m staring. In my line of work I’ve seen plenty of doubles but this one is eerie. Like there’s been a rip in the time space continuum. This woman sitting here at the bar could pass for Harper in a court of law.
    
    ‘In case you’re wondering, I dye my hair,’ she says suddenly. Her voice is husky, more scratchy than alluring. I wonder if she has a cold.
    
    ‘Excuse me?’ I say.
    
    ‘When I’m off the set, I dye my hair brown,’ she says, tucking a loose strand behind her ear. ‘People still bug me for autographs, but not as much.’ She’s wearing a navy cardigan and drinking the tiniest glass of wine I’ve even seen, the thing practically the size of a thimble. ‘Remember last year when the paparazzi got that shot of her without panties?’ I nod. It was all over the web, the story made even more bizarre by the fact that Harper had shaved her pubic hair into the shape of a cross. ‘Everywhere I went people kept throwing underwear at me,’ she says, letting a stream of air out through her pursed lips. The bartender comes over, refills her glass from an elegant looking bottle. ‘Danke,’ she says, barely taking a sip.
    
    ‘Bitte,’ he says, walking away.
    
    Faux Harper smooths one of her eyebrows. ‘You’re her teacher, aren’t you?’ I nod and wonder how old this girl is, if she’s over twenty-one. ‘I feel for you, I really do,’ she says.
    
    ‘Why?’
    
    She shoots me a look and I settle on my bar stool. ‘Don’t you ever feel like you’re going to explode?’ she says. ‘You know, from keeping it all inside, all the things you’ve seen her do and have to keep to yourself?’ She takes another sip, her pinkie extended in the air. ‘Once, she made Kim, her assistant, buy a bunch of suppositories but evidently she didn’t read the box. She comes up to us and says, “How are you supposed to swallow these things?”’ Faux Harper bends over and mock pounds her head on the bar a couple of times. Her laughter is surprisingly deep. ‘Ah,’ she finally says, wiping her eye. ‘It probably would’ve killed her, and I’d be out of the easiest job in the world.’
    
    ‘Here’s to the easiest job in the world,’ I say, raising my glass. I’ve often wondered about body doubles, if the work makes you feel like a star in your own right or if it’s as boring as it looks. They stand in for the star as the crew sets up the shot. Basically they need someone to stand where the star will stand so they can figure out details about lighting and sound – how high to place the boom, which side of the star looks better from where. Faux Harper could make real money doing nude scenes for Harper when Harper comes of age.
    
    ‘Speaking of losing the easiest job in the world,’ I say.
    
    ‘What? You?’ she says. There’s genuine concern in her voice.
    
    I order another drink and tell her about the Trigonometry unit Harper needs to pass. I tell her about the LA County Board of Off-Site Learning and how when I get back they’re going to strip me of my license. I tell her about Harper’s bank account. I tell her about the time I saw Harper lying in the dunes making out with one of the twenty-something producers. Talking to her is like talking to a stranger on a plane – I can’t seem to help myself. I consider telling her about Christina and Slobodan, but I decide this isn’t about me. It’s about Harper and how she can’t even calculate the area of a perfect triangle.
    
    ‘We should do something,’ faux Harper whispers. In the corner I see faux Andy leaving with the beautiful bald woman, a small pile of pink bills heaped on the table.
    
    ‘Like what?’
    
    Faux Harper takes a slow sip. For a moment I think she is Harper. From the length of her neck to the small green vein bordering her hairline – it all seems to add up to Harper. For the first time all night I notice there’s polka music playing on the stereo. Behind us faux Brennan is dancing suggestively with her pool cue. Faux Harper studies my face for an eternity. I wonder what she’s looking for. I sit quietly and keep my mouth shut as I’ve learned to do around movie people. Finally faux Harper speaks, enunciating every syllable. ‘I don’t think there’s much of a future in being Harper,’ she says carefully. I know what she means. Nine times out of ten today’s teen star is tomorrow’s reality TV contestant. Most of the kids I’ve ever taught on location are out of the business. ‘I’ve been thinking about it for a while. Sometimes the non-talent,’ she says, pointing to the two of us in the mirror, ‘needs to cash in.’ She sits quietly letting her words sink in. I finger a razor bump on my cheek. She asks if I know anyone at the tabloids.
    
    ‘Tabloids?’ I say, as if I’ve never even heard the word before. I don’t want to admit it, but yeah, I have a few business cards from gossip mongers stashed away in my wallet for a rainy day.
    
    She takes this for a yes and leans over, lays out the plan. I listen to everything she says. Am I capable of this? I wonder if faux Harper is drunk, if this is something she’ll just laugh off tomorrow. When she’s finished, she orders us two shots of an aged South African whiskey. ‘To non-talent inheriting the earth,’ she says, hoisting her glass. Faux Harper puts hers back like she’s drinking water. Mine burns all the way down.
    
    In the corner someone screams. Faux Gorgeous has hit a regular in the shoulder with a dart. I grab my keys from the bar.
    
    ‘Wiedersehn,’ says the bartender, and pulls a small first aid kit out from under the counter.
    
     
    
     
    
    The next morning Andy is already in the trailer by the time I arrive. He’s in full wardrobe, wearing period clothes which are carefully stained as if he were traveling a thousand miles through the desert. Gently I put my briefcase down on my desk. ‘Morning,’ I croak. My head is throbbing. I feel like one of those cartoon characters who hits his thumb with a hammer. I can practically see the hurt lines radiating out, my head the epicenter.
    
    Andy lights a cigarette. Brennan and Harper aren’t scheduled to be in today. Andy gets kidnapped by a spice caravan early on, so his role isn’t as big as theirs. Sometimes when the girls aren’t in the two of us sit chain smoking and reading Hamlet out loud. Andy’s just finished writing a persuasive essay about whether Gertrude’s a sympathetic character. His paper’s pretty good. He takes an actorly approach to it, claiming there’s no such thing as a totally unsympathetic character, that it’s the actor’s job to find the one glint of humanity in them.
    
    I walk around the trailer and close all the curtains. I wonder who would play me in the movie of my life, what glint of humanity they might find.
    
    Andy offers me a cigarette. There’s a world map up on his computer screen. ‘You think people will be able to tell this isn’t the Sahara?’ he asks.
    
    ‘What?’
    
    ‘You know, like movie goofs.com. We’re filming Tea in the Sahara in the Namib desert. You think people will know? Like maybe they’ll look at one of the camels and say, “That’s a sub-Saharan camel, not a Moroccan camel.”’
    
    I think about last night and faux Harper whispering in the dark, her plan simple yet elegant. ‘People will see what you want them to see,’ I say.
    
    ‘I guess,’ says Andy.
    
    I open my briefcase. There’s still the stain left over from where Harper spilled her coffee on it. I pull out an essay test on Hamlet, hand it to Andy. ‘It’s open book,’ I say. ‘Feel free to use the web.’ The first question says, ‘Is Hamlet an anti-hero? Why or why not?’ In my briefcase there are four cans of warm beer. I hand one to Andy, then sit back and pull out my camera. It’s a state-of-the-art Leica R9 with both an analog and digital system. I bought it last year before I went to Mongolia on a shoot. On the LCD screen it says I’ve taken a total of fourteen pictures.
    
    I pop open a beer, look at my watch, let a stream of smoke out through my teeth. I know how this must look. I flip through the camera manual. I can feel another door closing in my life. Outside a siren blares. It means they’re filming. I pick up the camera, look through the viewfinder. For a second all I can see is my own eye.
    
     
    
     
    
    According to the plan I’m supposed to be in position by four in the afternoon. I keep my camera in its case in my bag and take the back route through the props tent. At this time of day there’s hardly anyone around. I pass a huge animatronic camel they built just for Brennan. At one point she’s supposed to ride through the desert all by herself to get help. Lloyd’s wouldn’t insure her for the scene, so they built this thing. Looking at it, I’d rather take my chances with a real camel.
    
    I turn a corner and come to the area on location where the talent lives. Their trailers are doublewides, each one with a satellite dish cupped on the roof. Gorgeous has two doublewides which somehow have been joined together. The thing is probably at least a thousand square feet. His assistant say he spends most of his time in there reading, but nobody here believes that. Finally I see Harper’s trailer. It has a purple awning and two chairs out front. I don’t have to be too close, so I walk to the end of the doublewides and climb a small dune.
    
    I pull out my camera and settle in behind the crest. It’s not quite four. Within a couple of minutes I’ve already managed to scratch my lens. God, the sand really is terrible. I try to remember what the devil tempted Jesus with in the desert. I can feel myself baking. I pull out a bottle of water and wet the back of my neck. The devil said something or other about bread, something about casting yourself down and letting the angels bear you up.
    
    I hear an ATV revving over the sand. I look through the lens. It’s faux Harper, right on time. She’s wearing the same calico dress Harper wears, her hair also in a period style, her face also bruised from Harper’s fall off a camel in scene fifty-seven. I snap some shots. She opens the trailer door, steps inside. I’m almost a football field away but there she is on the LCD screen clear as day. She stands in one of the windows and gives me a thumbs up, though I can tell she can’t see me because she’s looking at the wrong spot. Faux Harper turns and begins poking through the kitchenette. She’s looking for Harper’s stash. Turns out Little Miss Sunshine likes to a do a line of coke now and then. Surprise surprise. Suddenly Faux Harper stops her snooping, flips open her cell phone. I see her talking. She walks back to the window and holds up her index finger, signaling for me to wait.
    
    I watch her leave the trailer, hop on her ATV and roar off. I lie back. What was the third temptation? Something about dominion over everything. It’s weird how I remember what Satan said but not what Christ did. For a moment I doze off. Then I hear the ATV coming back. I raise my camera.
    
    It’s faux Harper again. She heads straight to the kitchenette and pulls out a small Hello Kitty bag from a drawer. On the kitchen table she lays it all out – mirror, straight edge, straw, a baggie full of powder. I snap away. Faux Harper keeps a straight face but I wish she’d slow down though I guess she’s right to hurry – we don’t want it to look staged. Then faux Harper puts the straw in her nose. I blaze away. This shot could be worth a million dollars. To my surprise she snorts the line right up, throws her head back, tears forming at the corners of her eyes. I rack my brain. She didn’t mention taking it this far, then again, she didn’t mention not taking it this far. I guess that’s why she needs the money. I put the Leica in rapid mode, take five shots a second.
    
    I hear another ATV coming down the track. Inside faux Harper quickly repacks everything, shoves it back in the drawer. Outside it’s the twenty-something producer, the one I saw Harper making out with in the dunes. He gets off his bike and heads in. Faux Harper is lit up like a rocket, her pupils blasted wide open from whatever she just hoovered off the table. The producer puts his arms around her and they begin to kiss. They lie down on the small kitchen table, and when the producer pulls the calico dress over her head, I see it inked in red and gold on the small of her back – a skeleton key tattoo. Harper’s trademark. It’s really her.
    
    On the viewfinder I watch and consider. Somehow it doesn’t look real. Maybe the lighting’s wrong, or maybe it’s grotesque the way real sex is.  The fact that the producer just unzips his pants while Harper’s totally naked makes it seem even seedier. I could maybe get three million for these. I advance to nine shots a second. I tell myself this is just a joke, something I’ll tack up later in Harper’s trailer just to freak her out. Her face is twisted, the bruise on her cheek shimmering in the light.
    
    When they’re done, they share a cigarette. Harper’s hair is a mess. She’ll have to go back to make-up. I start to repack my camera. That’s when I notice Brennan sitting behind me half-way up the dune. She’s wearing her sun hat and holding a plastic shovel. For a moment she’s just a little girl playing in the sand. Then the light shifts, and I see those blue eyes. The kid is looking at me like she’s seen it all before."

    "text": "It is strange to devote so many hours to a saint. She has never fully believed in them, nor their stories. Haunting pillars, abiding in the wings of triptychs, for a long time she regarded them as secondary characters, part of the choreography of an important scene to which they are witness but, for the most part, not essential. To her mind, a rock is only ever a rock. A wheel, a wheel. But there he is, a solitary man in the wilderness. A wilderness that’s intransigent and unyielding but also malleable, accommodating the saint’s needs, inner and outer, the rock with which he beats his breast magnified by the geological formations behind him and their mysterious silence, the inscrutable blue of his eyes echoed in some expanse beyond. And there he is again, in his wood-paneled study: pensive, silent, contained. He is, after all, the most scholarly of saints, often depicted as a humanist figure absorbed in inquiry and translation.

    Ever since she was young, she has collected images of Saint Jerome. It started with a postcard a friend once sent her, a painting by a Frenchman with the improbable name of Jean-Léon Gérôme: an intimate scene of the saint and lion immersed in a deep sleep. The saint rests his head on the lion’s flank, and a hand on its hind paw. The animal is relaxed, its vigil suspended. Apart from the absolute trust between the two species, she was struck by how soiled the soles of the saint’s feet appeared to be, as though he hadn’t washed them in weeks. She taped the image to her kitchen wall. And bought the next postcard she found, and the next. After a few years the wall was covered in images – postcards, mainly, but also a few magnets – of Saint J, as she had started to call him. She knew it was absurd but sometimes, alone in her study with her own whiskered conscience by her side, she felt a kinship across the centuries. A quick glance was all it took to note her preference for scenes where the lion was present– without the lion, the saint’s story was more psychodrama, a man and his struggle with no elegant or endearing third party – but even when Saint J was alone, the lion was everywhere.
    
    Museum posts came and went. Six books, two houses, four cats and one dead husband. Late one night while riding the bus home through a desolate patch of city, fighting the sensation that nothing lay ahead of her and everything behind, an idea visited like a rapping at the window: she would curate one final exhibition. After many back-and-forths, her proposal was accepted. A summons was issued across Europe and overseas, a call out for St Jeromes. Most hung in public collections, others in private, some in churches and monasteries or in the dark oblivion of a storage space. In a year’s time, they would all be packaged into crates and brought to Madrid by human couriers.

    The flat they have given her is one street from the museum. From her terrace she can see its roof. This way she can come and go while the show is being installed. Every evening she goes out onto the terrace and smokes a cigarette, and for its duration she gathers her thoughts. She often smokes half or a third, each tasting more sepulchral than the last, and puts it out in a flowerpot. Just a bit more thought-herding and then she’ll quit. For now, she’s too aware of the ideas born from the fumes and head rush.
    
    Autumn has settled in, the evening pulls at her sleeves, but she hardly notices. She packed the wrong clothes, assumed Madrid would be warmer than London. In the distance the words palace hotel in fiery pink add temperature to the skyline. Her thoughts return to the museum and she thinks of the endless rows of paintings, at that hour unseen. She moves abstractly through one wing and then another, lingering here and there, until arriving at the medieval section. That’s where the ghosts, were there to be any, would reside, convening in the Romanesque chapel or swimming in the otherworldly blue of the walls. Her dead husband would be there too, jumping over the cordons and pressing his face to one of the gold-leafed panels, yes, once liberated from all constraints he would have relished the freedom and not cared whether he ever came too close.
    
    Still far off in thought, she steps inside and slides closed the door to the terrace, draws the curtain. Her reverie is soon interrupted by the sound of someone walking, in heels, in the flat overhead. The hanging lamp is disturbed ever so slightly.

    On an earlier visit she had drawn up a map of the exhibition. It would have four sections, St J’s life parceled out like the panels of an altarpiece.
    
    Section one: St J’s importance within a historical, intellectual and biblical context.
    
    Section two: St J as translator in his study (room, cabinet, cell, scriptorium).
    
    Section three: St J as penitent in the wilderness (desert, grotto, exuberant landscape).
    
    Section four: the lion, pulled into greater focus– like Saint George’s dragon, it appears in all sizes, and with a range of expressions (fierce, plaintive, quizzical).

    At the Corte Inglés she fills her cart with food she knows she will never eat, jars and jars of olives, grilled peppers and artichoke hearts and enough crackers for two. The activity relaxes her and is far less arduous than its sequel, which involves carrying the heavy bags over her shoulders through the Puerta del Sol, hurrying her steps towards the quieter side streets. She wonders whether anyone at the museum has noticed her melancholy or detachment. Perhaps they assume she’s wearing the weather of her native country, clothed in it so fully she’s unable to shed even the outer layers when abroad. A friend told her that whenever she felt a stab of self-pity she should add ‘n’ to ‘widow’ and remind herself that even within the monolith of loss there’s at least one view out. When she returns to London she will start anew. Will finally go through the clothes that have been hanging, untouched for years, in the wardrobe. But for now, no parallels: no penitence, no wilderness, no animal companion.

    In the narrow entrance to the exhibition they will hang a timeline. It is important not to offer too much, only the essentials, in order to avoid overcrowding.
    
    347 AD: birth of Eusebius Hieronymus Sophronius in Stridonia, Dalmatia (near modern day Ljubljana)
    
    At the age of twelve, he goes to Rome to study grammar, rhetoric and philosophy. He visits the catacombs often.
    
    In 360 he is baptised, most likely by Pope Liberius.
    
    As of the age of twenty, he embarks on a more nomadic lifestyle. He travels to Bethlehem via Antioch and Alexandria.
    
    In Antioch he suffers a crisis of faith and writes what is probably his first text, De septies percussa, Concerning Seven Beatings. In mid-Lent 375 he has a life-changing dream, in which he’s brought to a tribunal before the Lord and accused of being a Ciceronian – that is, of preferring the classics (pagan literature) to Christian writings.
    
    He prays and fasts in the desert of Chalcis, and learns Hebrew from a Jewish convert. He then acquires Greek.
    
    A quarrelsome man with strong opinions, he disagrees with others on certain ecclesiastical and theological matters. He quits the desert and returns to Antioch, where he is ordained a priest by Bishop Paulinus in 379.
    
    Summoned back to Rome, he becomes papal secretary to Pope Damasus in 382. He devotes himself increasingly to scholarly investigations of the Bible and translation. He preaches the importance of the monastic life and condemns the hypocritical lifestyle of the clergy. He falls out with many of his colleagues. After Damasus passes away, Jerome heads for the Holy Land in 385.
    
    In the Holy Land he meets Saint Paula, a wealthy, widowed nun. His fortunes change. He joins Paula’s virginal entourage including her daughter Eustochium in a pilgrimage through Egypt and Palestine. He becomes their spiritual advisor.
    
    In Bethlehem, Paula erects a monastery to Jerome and his followers. Another one is set up for the nuns. Apart from the occasional journey, he will spend the rest of his days here.
    
    One day a lion limps into the monastery. The other monks flee. Jerome examines its paws and discovers a thorn in the left one. He extracts the thorn. (As a saint versed in translation, he is also adept at interspecies dialogue). The lion becomes his constant companion.
    
    From 391 to 406 AD, he devotes himself to the translation of the Bible into Latin.
    
    Jerome also writes many letters. He is concerned with the morals of women and is a strong believer in their chastity.
    
    He dies on 30 September 420. It is Saint Paula who closes his eyes as Jerome is lain out on the marble slab.
    
    St Jerome enters the popular imagination thanks to Jacobus de Voragine’s Golden Legend, a medieval best seller, and then voyages through the Renaissance, a figure and an iconography endlessly recast. Erasmus of Rotterdam described him as a river of gold.
    
    After the Counter Reformation, his significance shifts from that of intellectual to penitent, hence the two distinct ways in which he is portrayed.

    What, then, of the lion?
    
    They say he guarded St J’s tomb day after day, refusing to eat, until he eventually joined him in the afterlife.
    
    Thoughts on the lion:
    
    The lion often has a human face. Or that of a carved fountain. Sometimes its expression is so human, one wonders whether it is meant to convey the saint’s innermost thoughts. Alter ego or altar ego, depending on the situation. Sometimes it is dog size, or cat size, or even smaller: a chess pawn or salt cellar, ready to leap onto the saint’s lap and disappear into the folds of his robe.
    
    What do people look at first, the saint or the lion? Nearly always the saint, yet just to confirm it is him they quickly search for the feline signifier nearby.
    
    Alongside the saint it appears docile, placid, subjugated, submissive. In contrast to the restless saint, who is always active, either beating his chest with a rock or buried in books in his study. He hardly ever sits doing nothing, doesn’t practice acedia the way other saints do.
    
    The lion hovers, crouches, rests, lingers, paces, nearby, a verb, a noun, an adjective, to the saint’s existence. As vigilant as grammar, it sometimes naps with its eyes wide open.
    
    At the monastery the monks demand that the lion work for its daily sustenance. Jerome orders it to guard the convent donkey on its trips to fetch firewood. One day the lion wanders off into the desert – every now and then it must, after all, give in to its animal nature – and leaves the donkey unguarded. In that brief window of time, the donkey is seized by robbers and sold to a caravan of merchants. The lion returns to the convent alone. The monks assume it has eaten the donkey. The lion is ordered to atone. This means more work. The lion obeys. One day it spots the donkey in the caravan and brings the entire gang to the monastery to prove its innocence. We do not know much more about the donkey other than that it trusted the lion and seemed to regard it as a friend.
    
    She is not the first to wonder what really happened to the lion after the saint’s death. Does the animal indeed waste away or dematerialize back into myth? As though its very existence hinged upon the saint’s recognition. In the Carpaccio fresco the lion is already relegated to the background as the monks pray over St J’s lifeless body, his head resting on a stone.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    And what of Paula?
    
    In paintings she appears far less frequently than the lion. And yet she too was a crucial figure in his biography.
    
    By some accounts, Paula not only encouraged Jerome to translate the Bible but financed the enterprise. Along with supplying money and motivation, she is said to have edited the work, copying it and making corrections along the way. As patroness of the Hieronymites, she created a haven for these monks to lead the cloistered, scholarly lives they sought. And yet out of the forty-five paintings in the exhibition, not one of them features Paula. A terrible oversight, which dawns on her too late.

    There are few amenities in the area where she lives. Only the local Chinese convenience shop and one selling costly fruit, as sumptuous and elusive as the bunches of glass-green grapes that hang around the corner from Velázquez’s crucifix, each in near or total darkness. She is thankful for the canteen, where she has lunch most days and tests her Spanish. After a year of online classes she can understand the gist of most sentences, and yet some museum staff speak too fast to decipher what they say. It depends on who is talking. A few days ago, for instance, a curator spoke about the Treasure of the Dauphin, a collection of rock crystal and hardstone vessels, many in the shape of fantastical creatures (aquatic, airborne, grotto-dwelling) from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. At the top of a dark flight of stairs in a dimly lit room, where the elliptical display and departure from the rectangular make everything more mysterious, is this, the museum’s own cabinet of curiosities. A ‘sanatorio de joyas’ the curator called it, and she agreed there was something convalescent about this crystal menagerie, not to mention many of the pieces had custom-made leather cases with velvet or silk lined interiors, and it was only when he repeated his phrase that she realised he’d said ‘tanatorio’.
    
    Death stalks many a conversation. On another occasion, she listens to an art restorer describe two galgos he’d seen hanging from a tree in the countryside, that was how hunters disposed of their dogs once they were no longer of use to them. She’d glimpsed many of these slender, timid greyhounds being walked around the streets of Madrid, individuals lucky enough to be rescued in time and put up for adoption, far more fortunate than their lifeless counterparts, hung so that their feet just brushed the ground. The restorer illustrated this with a movement of his hand across the surface of the table.

    On the floor above, another exhibition is being installed and will open shortly before hers. She goes by to watch it being mounted. The Lost Mirror it is called: representations of Jews and conversos in medieval Spain. She watches as two men place a Haggadah from the British Library in a vitrine and then seal it hermetically. Some walls have only labels, others already have their paintings in place. From afar she’s drawn to the little theatres of ritual, often enclosed within a fantastical architecture, but upon moving closer she sees auto-da-fés and desecrated hosts. Some works are self-evident in their malice, in others she has to search for the bearded figure who subverts the scene.

    At home, her awareness of the floor above leaves a different sort of incision. She hasn’t slept well since she arrived. Her neighbor paces at one in the morning and resumes at seven. Her neighbor seems to always be home. She can trace their path from room to room, knows the moments the person is at rest (few) and those when he or she is in motion. The steps suggest a woman in heels, but one can’t draw any conclusions. One day soon, when she’s feeling assertive, she will go up and speak to them. If her husband were here, so jaunty and uninhibited, she would have sent him at the second instance.
    
    From her terrace she can see the little figures of men hammering at the museum’s dome. She hears them, too, the sound soothing and constant, a gentle pattering much less intrusive than footsteps, and imagines the workmen hammering directly above the Goya painting of an injured mason. How strange it would be if, over two hundred years later, they were right above their historical counterpart. Another note to self: go investigate.

    Quill, vellum, tallow. Along with his companion, St J’s work materials all hailed from the animal kingdom. She is ever more attuned to the animals in the museum. They offer a different dimension of experience. Dogs, horses, birds, lions, apes. She views them as only that. For her they do not embody kings, critics or clergymen. In front of Goya’s dog she listens to an exchange between two elderly German women. “Ein Hund, ein Hund,” says one. ‘Ganz hilflos’, says the other. Goya’s dog. Why does she, and the rest of humanity it seems, always end up in front of it? The caption in Spanish reads ‘Perro semihundido’. In English, ‘Drowning Dog’. In Spanish it is half submerged, in English, condemned, its fate sealed in this leap between languages. A mysterious shape looms in the nebulous space into which the dog gazes, like a master acquiring substance. If the shop were to sell an hourglass containing a tiny figure of this dog, would it be placed in the top half, with the sand draining away, or in the bottom half, slowly immersed?

    In the cafeteria late one afternoon she encounters an elderly man eating a slice of lemon cake. She smiles at him as she sits down with her tray. That is enough of an encouragement, and from the table beside hers he tells her about his day looking at Bosch, how the Bosch paintings with their mischievous grotesques remind him of friends from his adolescence, his monologue launched with The Garden of Earthly Delights, after admiring it for so long in books it was a thrill to spend hours in front of it, and at some point he even saw a moth fly past the painting and a guard rush over and clap his hands and miss, which was just as well since it really did seem as though the insect had emerged from the triptych and was perhaps very ancient, if you zoomed in you’d probably see it had the face of a mouse or a demon, and he tried to guess which panel it might have emerged from, Eden or Hell or the teeming garden between? His monologue then moves on to the Adoration of the Magi, another triptych in the room, smaller but also magnificent, he says, with all those enigmatic faces staring out from gaps in the roof and the walls, and he especially liked the handsome donkey, but the moth didn’t seem interested, and a little later he noticed it in the vicinity of the Haywain triptych, where Hell is an ongoing project, still under construction… Bosch was a magus, the man went on, he saw the pensive faces of deep-sea creatures centuries before ocean navigation and recognised the splendours of mutants before hybrid experimentation, and the ways in which man could create hell on earth, long before the birth of nuclear energy. The world is full of wonder. But we destroy ourselves.
    
    After expressing these thoughts the man pauses to blow his nose and, just as he is about to resume, an elegant woman appears with two large shopping bags from the museum gift shop. Judging from the way she puts them down and leans over to straighten his tie, she is his wife, and after ensuring the tie is hung at the right angle she mentions they have spent the day with Velázquez and Murillo and Zurbarán, this is their first time in Madrid and they thought they’d begin with the Spaniards, they have yet to see Bosch but would try to arrive early tomorrow to avoid the multitudes, had heard that room got particularly busy . . .
    
    As she speaks her husband begins folding his napkin, he folds it one way and another, and then tucks it under his dish. He drinks from a glass of water, sets it back down. His wife says she’s just going to nip back to the shop to get one more scarf. She leaves the two large shopping bags on the seat beside him. After she goes off he doesn’t speak again. Had his imagination created this mythical day with Bosch, had the anticipation been so great, had his thoughts rushed ahead of him and conjured this whole experience before it even took place?

    In his essay on Old Age, Cicero observes, ‘Old age has its appropriate weapons: namely, the study, and the practice, of decent, enlightened living’. Keep the mind active, and the body too, continue as best you can the pursuits of earlier days. He describes the pleasures of spending time with others – but in the end, he writes, the human spirit returns to live within itself.
    
    She wonders whether reading Cicero not only added colour and nuance to St J’s Latin prose but provided him with wisdom and insight for his own twilight years, no matter how fiercely he later tried to distance himself from those writings.

    There is one work she is still waiting on. All the others have been confirmed and are in different stages of arrival. The painting she is hell-bent on having is highly unusual: it’s the only depiction, as far as she’s aware, of Saint Jerome present at the Annunciation. As though eavesdropping. There he is, a skinny spectral figure in white, hanging around in the background, with lion nearby. What is he doing there, privy to this intimate moment? After several exchanges with the Venetian family that owns the painting, it remains unclear whether they will agree to lend it.

    In the museum shop she buys two glasses cases. Both are adorned with dogs, one golden yellow and the other mired in yellowness. One is Goya’s half-sunken dog, the other a poised, regal hunting dog painted by Velázquez. She will use the confident hound for the pair of glasses she wears when out in the world and the anguished dog will be for her reading glasses, the ones she slips on when she’s going to write, even if she has since learned that there were originally two birds in the sky, two birds on which the dog has set its sights, Goya’s painting therefore perhaps not quite the expression of despair, not quite that iconic image of anguished modernity, that she and most others had imagined, and yet its expression still captures the unease, the existential circling she does, each time she sits down at her desk.

    She can decipher the newspaper headlines at the kiosk. The agitated chatter in the canteen. In her flat, she listens to the radio while she cooks. There is unrest in the city. Tensions within and between political parties. Talk of an amnesty. As she settles down for a quiet supper the footsteps overhead begin again and the lamp to sway a little. The steps are soon accompanied by the sound of furniture being moved, as though the person were wearing heavy Dutch clogs from another century and, just to make sure she can hear it, has started dragging farm equipment across the room. She lays down her fork, puts on a sweater.
    
    All this time she had imagined someone younger, someone kept awake by fear and excitement of the unknown, but the door opens to reveal a woman in her mid to late sixties, her grey hair pinned up in a raggedy fashion. In the palm of one hand she holds a tiny pile of cold cream. A small white dog runs out from behind her, stops at the elevator and starts to yap. (Strange she’d never heard it). For an instant the dog and the cold cream seem made of the same substance.
    
    ¿Sí?
    
    Now that they stand face to face, all the phrases she’d rehearsed abandon her. Apart from a summer’s German, she has always been poor at other languages. And yet she quickly spots the culprit: paisley slippers with chunky heels, like loafers.
    
    ¿Sí? The woman asks with more emphasis.
    
    Instead of replying she makes a walking gesture with her middle and index fingers, tracing a path in the air.
    
    Insomnia, she says, drawing out the word.
    
    The woman nods excitedly.
    
    Sí, sí, she exclaims, insomnio, and taps her forehead.
    
    But she hasn’t come searching for communion. She wants to explain that she hates the thought of this shared affliction, hates someone else adding foot notes to her night. But the words escape her. It’s the woman who is in command of the situation. And just to show her, she summons her dog with a high-pitched whistle. The animal bounces back down the corridor and into the flat, a white fluffy thing full of energy, in fact it seems to contain all of the energy that’s been drained from her night after night, the restorative sleep she so craves, absorbed by this fluffy white thing upstairs, and once the dog is inside, the woman holds up the cold cream in her hand – she must return to her ablutions – and says buenas noches before closing the door.

    The storage rooms are an immense catacombs, with paintings of all sizes hooked onto tall sliding racks and row upon row of statues with identification tags hung round their necks, all lingering in a state of latency and expectation. Some paintings haven’t seen the light in years, perhaps a century, and are in need of a long visit to the restoration wing. Others move between above and below. The art handler helps her scour the massive sliding racks. The paintings are arranged with little coherence, subordinate to scale rather than artist, period or theme. That afternoon she unearths nine Saint J’s, all residents of that other wilderness, the dormant collection.

    One of the hazards, she knows, of working with a saint, is the steady demystification. Scholars have suggested it was not even Jerome who had the fateful encounter with the lion. She closes her ears to those conjectures. Regarding the life of a saint, who is to say which scenes are real, which fabrication? She imagines him in his study. He must have had such a sharpened sense of purpose. Did hunger or distraction ever enter, or a monk with a query, or an impertinent fly?
    
    She struggles with the captions, little feats of compression, and with the introductory texts for each section. She must also finish the catalogue essay. It’s much easier to break down another life into captions than your own and yet reducing any life to 75-word segments requires a certain mercilessness. Be merciless, she tells herself as she pours a second glass of wine and rings another friend in London. You should go out more, they say to her every night, but she sticks to her tiny radius. The quill on the page, the needle used to extract the thorn: each carved a path inwards and outwards. A widening of life. As for her own, her impulse is to narrow it.

    On the first Friday of November she travels to Valladolid. The weather grows colder as the train cuts through deep Castile and it is chilly in the compartment. Valladolid is an impenetrable town. Streets vacant, a claustral air. At the sculpture museum she visits the two St Jeromes that will soon travel to Madrid: a magnificent altarpiece, illustrating key moments in the saint’s life, and a small wooden relief of him in the wilderness with the lion. At the monastery she studies with morbid fascination the baby Jesus dolls in the vitrines, the maternal instincts of nuns passionately channeled into these combed, swaddled things, somehow reproduced in the rows of ornately topped sandwiches at the tapas place where she stops for lunch.

    The Prado houses many St J’s. In the end, she returns rather guiltily the nine she had pulled out from storage and keeps to the original four from the permanent exhibit: the Georges de la Tour in seventeenth century Tenebrist style, showing the saint absorbed in the reading of a letter, the two halves of the red seal-like stigmata. Then a José de Ribera, emotion wrought from the saint’s aging muscle and vivid red tunic. And one of the two Marinus van Reymerswaele’s, by far the witchiest, the saint’s webbed hands like aquatic creatures scuttling across the table. On a shelf behind him a crucifix looms over a mostly spent candle, its stilled drip echoing the folds in the loincloth. And of course Joachim Patinir’s glorious saint and lion enfolded by deep blues and greens and jagged rocky formations, with other little dramas unfolding in the distance.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Many of the art handlers have been working at the museum for decades. Some have back conditions and can no longer do heavy lifting. Two of the younger men have just moved the Patinir from room 55A to its place in the show. It looks a little off kilter, the rocky formations at even more of a tilt than usual. One of them pulls a spirit level out of a deep pocket in his overalls and holds the instrument to the top of the frame. He nudges the painting two millimeters to the right.
    
    The handlers excuse themselves to attend a staff meeting. She will use the free hour to visit the Goya cartoons, paintings made as preludes to tapestries, which live in a light-filled tower. As soon as she enters the first room she spots The Injured Mason, slumped in the arms of colleagues who carry him away from the construction site – from such a height, his survival doesn’t look promising. Contrary to her suspicion, there are no live workmen hammering at a dome above.
    
    Her eye fixes on a long, narrow, rectangular painting around the corner. It depicts a showdown between two cats, one black and the other striped grey. They stand face-to-face on a patch of brick wall, a fragment of a dilapidated ruin. It is impossible to tell how high the wall is, how large the ruin, whether it is dawn or dusk. Did one cat chase the other up to this spot or did they meet there? No one else is around to witness their encounter.
    
    Backs arched, fur bristling, ears pinned back. Each pair of yellow eyes expresses a different emotion, pupils wide or dilated. The grey cat bares its fangs in defensive mode, its lifted paw almost like a hoof. The black cat cowers and yet it’s the grey cat that has nowhere to go: if it takes a step back, it will fall off the wall, while the black cat can easily backtrack (behind it are a few descending steps). Yet it appears the more fearful and apprehensive. The sky behind the black cat is overcast. Behind the grey cat, luminous. Between the two animals a sprig of ivy pokes out from the brick, a feeble gesture of truce, faint against the light.
    
    At home that evening with a glass of wine, she examines a postcard of Goya’s cats and imagines that if one were to tilt the long painting this way or that, the weight of everything in the museum would shift.

    There has been further unrest in the city. Marches and banners, a sea of red and yellow flags, and an incandescence that at night smashes car windows and sets fire to rubbish bins. Sirens blare at all hours. Voices carry from dozens of streets away. Up until now she has dwelled at a comfortable remove – this is not her country, not her city, not her politicians – but the proximity of the sounds, encroaching on her home as she stands on her terrace, begins to disturb her.

    She returns to the other exhibition to see how it is advancing. Today the technicians are busy hanging a large triptych, adding garras and durmientes, claws and ledges, to the top and bottom of the frame. In another room two curatorial assistants adjust the height of a wedge on which rests the head of a marble statue. The measurements sent were a little off, the head is raised too much, they will have to shave off a bit of the wedge. She assumes the recumbent statue is of a saint lying in eternal peace after a life of martyrdom, but no, it’s a robed inquisitor.
    
    The oddest item in the exhibition is the Cristo de la Cepa, the Christ of the Vine, a coarse segment of trunk that resembles the figure of Christ. According to legend a Jewish laborer was working in his vineyard when he came across this peculiar figure with reddish roots sprouting from his head, beard, ears, groin and armpits. The man interpreted it as a sign and converted to Christianity, then donated it to the archbishopric of Toledo, where it became an icon in the seventeenth century, held aloft during festival processions in a special little case, people praying to the tiny Christ as they begged for rain. The powers of the man-root were deactivated in the eighteenth century when the Age of Enlightenment removed its charge, and [the] rain was seen to fall regardless. Donated to the cathedral of Valladolid, it became one of many objects demoted from icon to curiosity. She would like an oddity like this one in her show. How long does it take, she wonders, for a thorn to decompose?

    She can hardly believe the news, has to reread the email: the elusive painting is on its way from Italy. The family has finally agreed to lend it. There is just enough time, since they can rush it through; loans from private collections are free from the bureaucracy of large institutions. It will travel from Venice with a member of the family.
    
    That night she celebrates with an additional glass of wine. She’s on her terrace when she hears loud yelling in the distance, angry slogans flung into the dark sky alternating with the blare of sirens. She lights her cigarette and taps the ashes into a flowerpot. All of a sudden she sees clouds of smoke rising from the north face of the Prado, there by the Goya statue, and imagines a correlation between the flowerpot and the museum, that she has somehow set the museum alight with a tap of the cigarette. But no, it’s the protestors, they have gone and set fire to the building. She imagines masterpieces going up in smoke, can’t recall everything that hangs in the wing – the Poussins, and, even worse, the Titians. She rushes indoors to scroll through her phone until finding the name of the one Prado person she knows for certain will be awake at that hour. He sounds surprised to receive a call from her. She tells him the museum has been set on fire and he must alert security. Two minutes later he rings back. His voice is calm. He has spoken to the head of security. The clouds of smoke come from the climatisation wing, which gives off vapour at night, and what she has seen was nothing more than the museum exhaling. She’s not the first to have raised the alarm; a few times a year, people ring the bomberos. He thanks her for her vigilance and wishes her a good night.

    The woman is carrying a bag of groceries from the expensive fruit shop, her white dog on a tensed leash at her side. They cross paths outside the building. The woman stares at her and says, insomnio. This time she pretends not to hear the word they both inhabit.

    First the dome of his head emerges into view, then the mercurial eyes and the long meandering beard. Two handlers delicately remove the thick blanket that served as buffer between crate and statue. A shawl of bubble wrap is cast from his shoulders. It is a magical moment when the artworks start to arrive, their crates like orphaned Lego blocks, their primary colours indicative of country or museum. Some paintings and sculptures she has already met in person. Others she only knows from reproductions and no matter how much she has studied them, they contain a surprise: more sheen or patina, the saint’s expression gentler or more tempestuous, the lion more assertive or withdrawn.
    
    Among the Saint Jeromes she has convened, each has his own personality. The earliest are eleventh to fifteenth century manuscript pages from France and Flanders. Few depictions show him young or even middle-aged: in both desert and study, he is usually old, bearded and bony.
    
    The three from the Thyssen-Bornemisza – the Titian, the Master of Grossgmain, and the Bartolomeo Montagna – only had to cross the street. A Hans Memling has arrived from a private collection. A splendid Stefan Lochner from the US. The Cranach, from Vienna. The Colantonio. A Caravaggio. A Domenico Ghirlandaio. A Rubens. She fought for three jewels from London’s National Gallery: the Antonello da Messina, the Vincenzo Catena and the Dürer (soon to be joined by the Dürer engraving of St J in his study from the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin).
    
    It is late afternoon and she is standing with a technician and the head of temporary exhibitions trying to decide how close to hang the Titian and the Lochner, such different evocations and yet each brings out something in the other, when an assistant approaches. The courier has arrived with the artwork from Venice, she says.
    
    At the entrance stands an old man with a large package, bound up like a mummy, resting against his leg. Someone must have helped him in. Stooped, brittle, dressed in a tattered suit that was probably once quite elegant, the man says something in Italian, then Spanish, and, seeing her still struggling, in choppy English. Sorry it has taken so long, he says…
    
    Usually young people are sent as couriers, not individuals so timeworn they can hardly lift the work themselves, and yet when they shake hands she is struck by the softness of skin unacquainted with labor. Two technicians relieve him of the painting, place it on a nearby table and start to unwrap it. The man oversees the process.
    
    Here it is, the painting she’s been waiting for. She looks past Mary and Gabriel to the small figure at the back, sitting on the steps of a classical temple, leaning his head against a marble pillar. The crucifix and book lie in his lap, the skull nearby. A few steps away stands the lion, its head bowed and tongue unfurled as though in thirst or exhaustion. In fact, both look as though they’ve reached the end of a long journey. Painted in feathery white strokes, this is the most spectral St J and lion of them all.
    
    The old man watches the painting being hung on the wall, its hooks already waiting in place. From this moment onwards, no one else must touch the work until its return.
    
    Slowing her steps to match his, she gives him a cursory tour of the rooms. He only stops twice to inspect a painting – the Caravaggio and the Cranach – and once they reach the end of the show he mentions he hasn’t eaten since leaving home.
    
    She thinks of a wine bar on the corner, popular with museum folk. There’s a table at the far end. After a brief consultation they order wine and a cheese board. The man removes his coat and collapses back into his chair somewhat theatrically. It must have been quite arduous to bring this painting all the way from Italy, she says, sensing his wish to convey the immense effort. Oh yes, he replies, and goes on to explain that only after many hours of deliberation did they decide to lend it but no one could be bothered to come to Madrid, and they also refused to entrust it to anyone outside the family, so he took it upon himself to accompany this painting that had hung in his home since he was a child, even though he had now caught up with the age of the saint.
    
    The waiter reappears with a carafe of wine, two glasses, a cheese board and a breadbasket, lays everything out and departs.
    
    Now that the man sits across from her, she studies his face. She has always preferred landscapes to portraits but finds herself drawn to faces that resemble landscapes and to landscapes that resemble faces. This face is more of a landscape: deep-set eyes, a mountain ridge of a nose, thin lips like a forest parting. His features are sharp and only faintly softened by age. And his clothes smell strongly of pine – she imagines a large house encircled by dense garden – yet his face wears no vegetation.
    
    She stares down at his wrinkled hands, now cupping the glass of wine, and recalls their smoothness as he returns to the matter of the journey. He won’t deny it was difficult, he says, especially the ride on a gondola with the painting propped between his knees. As the gondolier steered them towards the train station they were rocked by a funerary gondola, it came so close their boat was sprayed with canal water, and he’d thrown himself over the painting to shield it despite knowing it had been very well wrapped. It wasn’t so much the water but the fact that this funerary vessel and its aura had passed so closely by, and he could even see the expressions of the mourners who, had they given it any thought, would have been surprised to see a man frantic about an inanimate object when they were there bidding their mortal farewells, but he had to guard it with his life. Apart from not eating he hasn’t slept either since he was too nervous to nap on the train and couldn’t let the painting out of his sight, you never know who might be lurking in a carriage nearby, so tonight he will stay at a hotel and in the morning catch the train home.
    
    Their conversation turns to the work itself. She’s thrilled to include the only instance where St J is present at the Annunciation, she says, topping up each glass. No, he’s just dreaming he is there, says the man, he really isn’t. He is there, she says. No, he’s dreaming it . . . He only imagines himself at the scene, can’t you see by the way he is drawn? Like the dream he had about reading Cicero? She asks. No, that dream he disowned later in life, he says. Erasmus said so himself. It hadn’t been a dream at all: Jerome really was punished for reading Cicero. It was not something he dreamt. But here he is dreaming he is present at the Annunciation.
    
    She doesn’t want to hear more and changes the subject. Tells him about how at the opening of the Saint Francis of Assisi exhibition at the National Gallery live wolves were brought in, and she would like to find a lion for hers. She pictures it sauntering up to the Puerta de los Jerónimos, scattering the guards like the monks at the monastery.
    
    She then tells him about the Saint Jeromes starting to arrive from around Europe and beyond, the daily tasks, the captions and the catalogue essay, the fantasist who spoke to her about having spent the day with Bosch. She tells him about the unrest in the city and the night she saw plumes of smoke rising from the museum.
    
    As she speaks the man tears apart the bread and dips chunks in his wine and eats them in loud, sloppy succession. She’s not sure how much he understands but that frees her tongue even more, and as she speaks she feels herself growing lighter and lighter like one of Poussin’s helium-filled puttis, pausing only to down more wine. Most of the cheeseboard sits neglected. But the sips have turned to swigs, and as she embarks on the subject of the woman upstairs and her white dog that has absorbed all of her energy, her eyes start to well up. Keep a lid on things, she tells herself, this really is too much, but she unravels. Something has unlocked. But only momentarily. After a minute or so of losing her composure she reins it back in.
    
    All this time the man has been wearing a silk scarf, midnight blue and pocked with cigarette burns or possibly moth holes, and he now removes it and leans across the table to pat the moist area beneath each of her eyes. This gesture of intimacy, brief and unexpected, is followed by an uneasy silence, which she meets by waving over the waiter and asking for the bill.
    
    The meal is over. They stand up from the table, released from the moment. Someone else will have to finish the cheese board. Outside the restaurant she offers him her arm, which he gladly accepts, and then offers to walk him back to his hotel. It is Thursday night and the bars spill out onto the streets, the pavements filled with revelers. Every now and then, especially when in the vicinity of loud groups, the man grips her arm more tightly.
    
    From closer up the fiery pink letters of the palace hotel she has seen from her terrace seem less gaudy, almost alluring. In the hotel lobby he doesn’t let go of her arm and he now leads her. They do not speak in the elevator or once in his room. No, no, he says when she starts to unbutton her dress. They climb into bed with only their shoes cast off and very quickly fall into a deep sleep. She hasn’t slept so deeply in months, or beside another body in years, and she dreams of a lion on which she rests her head, rising and falling with its breath, instead of a man she dreams of a lion and instead of her husband she is reunited with all the cats from her past, multiplied and magnified, a large collective rumble from the afterlife channeled through the giant purring beast.
    
    But time and space return, and at some point in the morning her dream is shattered by a group of men who come charging into the hotel room. There’s only four of them yet they have the volume of a mob and for a second she thinks they are protestors who have stormed in from the street. Yet these men don’t have flags. And they have only one focus: the old man beside her. Two are well-dressed, the third wears a uniform, and the fourth, well, she is never certain who he is. The two well-dressed individuals lift the man from the bed and one picks up his shoes as they explain that their father has brought the painting to Madrid against the family’s will, they knew he was concocting something but it never crossed their minds that he would fill out the paperwork and sail off in a gondola with this rather unwieldy heirloom, who knows how he managed to carry it onto the train, but in any case, they are sorry, well, actually they are not sorry, but rather must inform her that they have already collected the painting from the museum and will now bring it back, along with their father, to Venice.
    
    She is silent as they take turns speaking, their English more fluent than their father’s, who is propped up between them like a bewildered ragdoll. She longs to go over and tug him free but remains at a distance, thankful she never undressed the night before. As he is led out of the room the man looks back at her and in his face she sees something like exhilaration.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    She dispatches her headache with coffee, a shower and four paracetamols, and then heads from home to the museum. There is an empty space where the Annunciation had hung. She must rethink that area. For the first time she feels the gaze of every St J, her movements tracked by sixty old men, sixty old men caught between the vertical and the horizontal, as she buttons her coat, which doesn’t shield her from the collective scrutiny.
    
    She is glad the other exhibition exists, something against which to measure her own. Five men in overalls are busy hanging a life-size crucifix of polychrome wood, Christ’s body covered in painted wounds supposedly inflicted by Jews, torrents of blood spilling from a gash in his right side. The sculpture dangles from a thick green rope, attached to the top of a small forklift that slowly moves it backwards and forwards, up and down, animating the Christ as the handlers seek out the right height from which to hang it. A durmiente is installed under its feet. Once the crucifix is fastened to the wall, another man holds a spirit level to Christ’s outspread arm. Or rather, to the straight wood of the cross to which his hand is nailed. There it is again, the spirit level, and he continues to hold it there, the bubble at the centre sensitive to the slightest of tremulations. He is measuring the spirit level. She feels her face start to flush, she feels her coordinates vanish, she doesn’t know what she feels, and she hurries out of the room, no longer trusting the equilibrium."

    "text": "We went to Iceland, me, my sister and our parents, like six weeks before they got divorced. I was almost twenty back then and my little sister Maggie was eighteen. I was self-conscious and androgynous and Maggie was very beautiful and troubled. I didn’t really get what her troubles were about, or what the meaning of her struggle was. ChatGPT said that beautiful eighteen-year-old girls might be struggling with social and emotional challenges, jealousy and friendships, online harassment, body shaming, toxic relationships, safety concerns, strict parenting vs. independence, and being underestimated academically, but none of those seemed quite right for my little sister Maggie. I looked at her over the tables of the Icelandic restaurants, over the plates of cold fish or whatever it was. I don’t really remember what we ate, but I do remember one thing: the cows’ heads, skin all dried out, flaking off the bone. There’d be a horrible white cavity where the ear should be, a white-rimmed hole with red inside and I never knew if the white was a bone or some massive, thickened vein or something, white with pus or with the build-up of some other clotted waste product. I don’t mean to be rude about the food. But the cows’ heads really made me feel suicidal, the mouths half-open. Were there teeth inside? The eyes looked shut because the eyes had been cut out. What did the base of the head look like, the place where the neck should have been? I had to stop myself from looking, I badly wanted to look but I knew that if I looked I’d have to see, and I didn’t want to see, I only wanted to surrender for a moment to the urge to look . . .

    I watched as Maggie saw the heads. She shivered, then her eyes glazed slightly over. She was tuning out the heads. I thought I couldn’t do it, make my eyes glaze over, tune things out. I thought I didn’t have Maggie’s dispassion, yes, I thought I was so passionate. I thought it was impossible for me to tune the heads out but of course it was perfectly possible.
    
    Our parents had strange, fake-seeming arguments that week. They argued about the news, about news items from years ago, Brexit and tariffs. They argued about if it was fine for me to be a vegan and not eat the cod liver oil that the hotels gave us at breakfast but I was almost twenty years old and nobody was about to force cod liver oil down my throat. I almost wished somebody would, not my parents, someone else, a stranger, I wanted someone to care enough to really do something to me. Our parents fought about the cod liver oil and about Maggie’s predicted A-Level grades which were obviously perfectly fine. The arguments seemed contrived and performative. But what roles were our parents performing, and why? Me and Maggie walked behind them, looking at the amazing dead volcanoes of Iceland, the crashing white waterfalls, the foul-smelling sulphuric springs. I tried to work out if Maggie was worried about the smell, if she thought that it might stick to her clothes and follow her around or something. Maybe later, when she took her clothes off, she’d put them in a plastic bag to try and contain it, stop it seeping out and contaminating all her stuff. But she didn’t seem worried at all. Maggie wasn’t vain, she was just beautiful. Maggie Sophia Harrington: what was she going to be? I watched her ponytail swing behind her, side to side, as she walked ahead of me among the craters.
    
    Me, I wanted to be a great writer of autofiction. I’d graduated high school that summer and I planned to spend my ‘gap year’ writing. But my life was so boring, there was no way it was ever going to work. Iceland had seemed promising, because it was Nordic, which sounded like Norway, the land of great autofiction. But it was boring here, the only special thing was the landscape but I wasn’t interested in describing that. The sunken blue lake at the bottom of the crater where a volcano had erupted 10,000 years ago: it was beautiful, it filled me with awe and with a weirdly thrilling feeling of destructive potential (was it perhaps the desire to die?), but I really didn’t care about describing it. It was better to just see it, to actually look at it, or to look at a picture of it, and it was easy to find pictures, anybody could do that, just type ‘crater’ into Google. I guess I wasn’t cut out for literary stardom. My parents stood behind me, arguing about whether Maggie and my expensive educations had been worth the money and about whether it was worrying that both me and Maggie were mentally ill and needed therapy and medication and didn’t seem to be getting better. It was all a bit much for me, to be honest.
    
    ‘Jane,’ Maggie said. It was funny that my name was ‘Jane’, the most generic female name, a female placeholder, and old-sounding, classic and ‘elegant’. . . I turned around. Maggie looked stunning against the grey clouds and the mist of rural Iceland. She wore sparkly eyeshadow and slightly sparkly blush and it shimmered on her clear smooth skin. She was so young and I am ninety-nine percent sure she was a virgin just like I was. She looked cold, she was shaking and she seemed pretty excited about something.
    
    ‘Yeah?’ I said.
    
    ‘I’m going to be in a movie,’ she said. ‘I mean I might. They’re still deciding.’
    
    ‘Who?’
    
    ‘The director. Or producers. The production company.’
    
    ‘How come?’ I said. ‘Is it for school?’
    
    ‘No, no, it’s Hollywood. It’s LA.’
    
    Probably she was lying. Maggie had some psychological problems which were supposed to cause lying. ‘Symptoms: Lying,’ the NHS website actually said about one of Maggie’s many alleged mental problems. I don’t say ‘alleged’ to dismiss her, I just mean that Maggie got labelled too much by doctors. She was just a troubled girl, I think. But what did I know? ‘It’s LA,’ I repeated and my heart was racing in spite of myself. A thousand songs about LA and California started playing in my head. I loved four or five different songs called ‘California’ and at least ten that mentioned LA. Everything I loved was American except for one or two Nordic things. I was obsessed with America and especially California and I guess Maggie was too.
    
    ‘That’s amazing,’ I said. ‘Congratulations.’
    
    ‘Thank you,’ she said.
    
    She said the movie was about some teenage sisters who kill themselves.
    
    ‘It exists,’ I said. ‘The Virgin Suicides. It already exists. It’s very famous.’
    
    She said the movie was a remake of The Virgin Suicides.
    
    ‘Weird,’ I said.
    
    ‘The Virgin Suicides is so good,’ Maggie said.
    
    ‘I know,’ I said. ‘It’s super good.’
    
    Maggie got me to take photographs of her beside the crater, so that she could send them to the adults who apparently cared about her out there in Hollywood. She looked ethereal. She kind of did look like somebody who might die young for tragic reasons, one of five doomed sisters. Maggie took her coat and tracksuit bottoms off and maybe I should have felt protective or worried about what was going on but I didn’t, not at all. I felt disturbed and quite enchanted. Maggie was wearing M&S kids’ underpants with the word ‘Tuesday’ written on them in pink cursive. Was she wearing those by accident or had she planned all this? In fairness she looked totally amazing. She let her hair down and it fell over her shoulders and all down her back. She took her jumper and her T-shirt off. Where were our parents? I looked to the horizon and I looked down into the crater: they were near the centre and I couldn’t see their faces. I could barely even tell them apart from up here. I needed new and stronger glasses. Maggie had small perfect breasts and frankly so did I, I knew I did. Nobody had ever seen them but I didn’t need anyone else to tell me how nice they were. Maggie took photos of me in all my clothes: it would have seemed contrived to take them off. It would have seemed imitative and therefore humiliating, even though I knew that I looked good. I kept my denim jacket and my jumper and my trousers on and Maggie said I looked like the young Donna Tartt. She was a sweet little sister, kind and thoughtful with great cultural references.
    
    ‘Thanks,’ I said. ‘That’s so nice.’
    
    ‘Please don’t tell anyone about the movie,’ she said.
    
    Who did she think I would tell? I never told anyone anything. I was a true teenage loner. I was reclusive. I was an artist, almost. I was the twenty-first century’s answer to Holden Caulfield, or maybe Esther Greenwood. Was it possible that Maggie was about to become famous? Me and Maggie were both smart, progressive, anti-capitalist people, and we were both quite rational, I really think we were, but we were secretly obsessed with fame. We never talked about it, it was just obvious. Both of us wanted to be known, to be known very deeply by somebody who would love us, to be witnessed by strangers, to be seen on screens across the nation, to be in the papers, to be profiled in New York magazines.
    
    ‘I was a cipher when I was young,’ I’d tell the magazines. ‘I was a symbol, I was nothing, I felt I had no soul. I couldn’t speak because I had nothing to say. I had no personality. I was less than an absence, I was a black hole, that’s how I saw myself, it was a scary feeling, it was very dark . . .’
    
    I wanted to tell the magazines about my difficult thoughts and to be seen as interesting because of them. I wanted to be seen as a talented amazing person with a dark and complex heart. I didn’t know how Maggie wanted to be seen but I knew she really wanted it, she badly wanted to be seen, I think she wanted to be famous even more desperately than I did. Me and Maggie didn’t want to die unknown and for a moment, instead of just standing there, I wanted to take her in my arms and hold her as our parents slowly and silently walked up from inside of the dark core of the crater.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    In Reykjavik me and Maggie shared a hotel room and in the evenings she had to practice acting. To be honest I don’t think she was very good.
    
    ‘The trees, like lungs, filling with air . . .’ she kept repeating to the mirror in a sentimental and nostalgic tone. Why was she speaking so nostalgically? It wasn’t a nostalgic line. Had Maggie even read The Virgin Suicides? I’d read it twice, at age thirteen and then again at age sixteen. Did Maggie even know that The Virgin Suicides was based on a book?
    
    ‘Just say it like you normally would,’ I said. ‘Don’t say it like that.’ But Maggie couldn’t improve, she wasn’t capable. She never changed, that was part of her problem. I tried to write a more naturalistic script for her to practice with, but writing scripts was as impossible as acting was. People only ever said banal things that looked idiotic on paper, and any meaningful lines I added seemed so contrived. What was the point of speaking? It was all kind of bullshit. It was totally banal. That holiday everything seemed banal. Our parents had taken us to Reykjavik but it felt exactly like Brighton or something, only with incomprehensible words in foreign characters on all of the street signs and shopfronts. There were record stores and vegan cafes and pavements painted with rainbows. Our parents argued about if trigger warnings were bad for universities and about what would happen when our grandparents died, whether me and Maggie would get some of their money, or just our parents and our aunts and uncles. I closed my eyes and tried to walk in a straight line by keeping the left side of my left foot against the curb of the rainbow-patterned pavement. I kept my eyes closed so that I could think clearly about movie producers. I pictured movie producers sat somewhere and watching me, watching me walk along the pavement, they would think that I was perfect for the role, for any role, but mostly for the lead role in The Virgin Suicides with all my youthful anxiety, my self-consciousness. I was pretty, I looked kind of like Maggie but I also looked like a boy, I hid my body which just made it more desirable, it was a secret, it was my secret with the wide open deserts of California, the country clubs, the palm trees, whatever else there was out there and when I opened my eyes it was snowing, the snow was falling thickly on the rainbow-painted ground and children were jumping up and down and making memories. I was practically twenty, I had a ton of memories already. I knew snow and I knew winter, I knew joy and I knew childhood, I knew failure, I knew emptiness, I knew I hated myself even as I worshipped and fetishised myself and my body. What the hell was going to happen to me? I put my headphones on and played some great, timeless and famous American music. I caught Maggie’s eye and she smiled at me, then she turned away and I was left listening to Bob Dylan through my headphones, listening to him ask me how it felt to be all on my own.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    After a while the movie started to seem real. Maggie stayed up late, sat in the bathroom taking meetings on her laptop. When I snuck up to the door I could hear a bunch of American people speaking about The Virgin Suicides. They spoke about how to make the new The Virgin Suicides adaptation feel different from the old one. They said the girls’ innocence felt contemporary and the aesthetics of the original movie felt contemporary too, so how were they supposed to make something new? These were the sorts of questions the producers discussed, or the writers or directors or whoever they were. What the hell was Maggie doing there? She didn’t say much in the meetings. She barely said anything. It was all super weird. I lay on my back in the single bed beside Maggie’s empty untouched bed and heard the muffled voices of American adults through her laptop speaker.
    
    ‘We all agree we want to make it dreamier, more surreal. I think we should really lean into the sisters’ perspective.’
    
    ‘Right. In the original, we see them mostly from the boys’ point of view, and what if we turn that inside out? Show the world as the girls see it: warped, distorted, suffocating.’
    
    ‘Detached, like they’re already fading before they even die.’
    
    ‘The key is making the audience feel trapped with them, right?’
    
    Was this really how movies got made? It all sounded quite fake to me. It sounded pretty dumb. I walked towards the window and stared out into the dark night of Reykjavik. I wanted Northern Lights or some more fucking snow, I wanted to be amazing, I wanted to be unforgettable, I wanted to be a genius, I wanted to meet somebody who thought I was a genius, some producer or agent or professor, I didn’t care who. I put on Maggie’s gingham Urban Outfitters bikini and I looked like a model with a perfect figure. I think it’s okay to say that. I hated myself, I really did, but I looked totally amazing in Maggie’s teen girl bikini. I left the bedroom and I went to the hotel pool. It was closed and so instead I sat outside for ages in the hot tub looking up at the black and hollow sky. The bubbles gathered round my body, the bubbles clung to me, they wanted to be close to me, the warm and quickly dying little bubbles, they all loved me and my body. Who in the world was going to love me most? Did my parents love me more than anyone else ever would, or would I meet somebody who loved me more? Had that person been born yet? Would any famous people love me? These all seemed like the wrong questions. They seemed close to the real questions, which were deep and philosophical, and related to my own hidden nature, to my life’s internal core and to the meaning of the future. But I couldn’t work out what those questions were.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    In our twin beds the next night, Maggie asked me what I thought her boundaries should be for the movie.
    
    ‘What do you mean?’ I said.
    
    ‘Like nudity, violence, sex . . .’ she said.
    
    ‘Isn’t that something you’re meant to decide yourself?’ I said. ‘I don’t know what your boundaries are. What sister would you play?’
    
    ‘Lux, they think,’ she said. Lux was obviously the best character, the main sister, Kirsten Dunst.
    
    ‘Okay,’ I said. ‘Well, she has sex and dies. So obviously you’d need to be fine with those things. Sex and then dying.’
    
    ‘They all die. Lux doesn’t die violently. She suffocates. She asphyxiates.’
    
    ‘Okay, then you need to be fine with sex and nudity but you don’t need to be fine with violence.’
    
    ‘Should I be fine with self-harm?’
    
    Maggie was starting to piss me off. Why should I care if she was fine with doing fake self-harm for a Hollywood movie?
    
    ‘Up to you,’ I said. ‘What does Peter think about the movie?’ Peter was Maggie’s psychoanalyst.
    
    ‘He thinks I should have more boundaries for it,’ Maggie said. ‘Boundaries on nudity, self-harm . . .’
    
    ‘Okay,’ I said. ‘I trust Peter.’
    
    What sort of person would have boundaries in a situation like this? What sort of girl wouldn’t want to go as far as she could, as far as people would let her go? A girl owned her life and her body, really these were her only two possessions, and she could do whatever she wanted with them. What sort of beautiful girl wouldn’t want to give away everything she had, her body, all her thoughts and feelings, everything, because finally she was allowed to give those things away and put them out into the public sphere, so that the other people had to deal with them and they weren’t just hers anymore? Obviously, having a life and a body was way too much for one person to carry. What kind of girl didn’t want to sacrifice herself completely, to surrender in the name of ‘art’, to lay everything totally bare out there in Hollywood? I didn’t say this though, I tried to be a good big sister. Sweet, respectful, kind and sensitive. I don’t think Maggie even cared about how nice I was being. At dinner she ignored me completely, she made herself as beautiful as she possibly could and then ignored me the whole night and made eyes at built and handsome Icelandic men while our parents fought about the American government. Maggie would make her boyfriends crazy someday. Probably she made Peter totally crazy and that was why he told her not to show people her body for the movie. Sorry, but it really might be true. I’m afraid to say I think it was quite likely.

    Now it was time to go to a different part of rural Iceland. This holiday seemed way too long, but I was fine with it, it was good to be isolated in a bleak and unknown landscape in the last days of my nineteenth year. Me and Maggie had separate bedrooms this time, the house we were staying in was huge and futuristic, built out of iron and thick triple-layered glass. How much money were our parents spending on this trip? It was all starting to seem a little sinister: the length of it, the cost, the different properties, et cetera. Even then I had the vague feeling that the trip was meant to mark something, some kind of ending. There was a heated pool and I hung my long legs into it and thought of Bret Easton Ellis, I thought of Less than Zero, I thought of luxury, corruption, violent crime and California. Our parents were fighting about euthanasia in the living room and I sat by the pool playing the saddest ‘California’ songs I knew, Lana del Rey’s ‘California’ on repeat and then the Warren Zevon song about walking down the sidewalks of LA. At night I went to Maggie’s room and tried to listen to her meetings through the door. I couldn’t hear anything. I walked into the garden and I stood outside her windows in the freezing cold and there I could hear everything. Maggie was speaking, was she trying to ‘act’ again? Her voice sounded confident and pretentious, kind of arch.
    
    ‘They’re trying to escape themselves,’ she said. ‘But they also want to understand. And they know they’re young, they understand their power, of course they fucking do.’
    
    I felt the wind against my face and neck and on my ankles and my wrists which my pyjamas left exposed. All of a sudden I didn’t want to be listening to Maggie anymore. Instead I listened to Lana del Rey beg some man to open her up and fuck her to death. Was that what I needed? To be opened up like that? I wasn’t sure. How was I supposed to open myself up at all? I could try drinking and I went into the kitchen. I saw the liquors in the cabinet, red liquors glinting in the darkness. I saw the knives inside the knife rack. I saw the garden through the layers and layers of glass and in the garden I could see the pool, deep blue and gleaming, hungry, beautiful, American. Who in the hell was Maggie speaking to? I poured some liquor in a glass, I wanted it to taste of cherries, artificial sweetened cherries, summer, childhood, not our childhood, pretty childhoods from television, from the Disney Channel which we weren’t allowed to watch, not ever, we watched Švankmajer movies. I wanted it to taste like sports days which we lost at every time, me because I couldn’t understand my body, I couldn’t master it, and Maggie because she couldn’t handle the crowds and being witnessed which I could also relate to, or maybe I wanted it to taste like aestheticised teen suffering, Euphoria, whatever, I didn’t even care, but it was just some normal whiskey. Heavy, smoky, nothing like Maggie. I went back outside to look at the window of my little sister’s bedroom.
    
    ‘They know they can play with the boys’ perceptions,’ Maggie was saying. ‘They enjoy it, playing with it, seeing where it goes. But there’s this emptiness that’s underneath that, right? They know they have that power but they don’t even care very much. Not Lux. She barely cares at all. To her it means, like, less than nothing. It’s worthless. It’s worth shit.’
    
    Was Maggie drinking tonight too? Was she drinking the same whiskey as me? She sounded drunk. My little sister . . .
    
    I stared ahead into the iron wall of the bedroom, its cold form dark against the sky, blocking out stars. I stared into the wall as if somebody might come out from inside of the wall and say, ‘Jane?’ What did I want them to say? I wanted somebody to say my stupid name and hug or kiss me. I was a conventional person, Jane Theresa Harrington . . . I wanted to be famous and successful and for men to love and notice me . . . I wanted a new life . . . I wanted to die . . . I wanted to die and be reborn . . . I could hear creatures in the bushes but I had no idea what sort of creatures lived round here. Wolves? Possibly rabbits? It was dark, too dark to see.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Nothing even happened after that. The movie had nothing to do with me and then it didn’t get made. Either it never existed or it ended up happening without Maggie. There never was a remake of The Virgin Suicides, I don’t think. Or not yet. I don’t really understand what happened. I guess nothing happened. Nothing happened to us out there in Iceland. Nothing happened to me back when I was nineteen. And yet somehow most nights when I’m trying to fall asleep I see the cow heads, the white waterfalls, I see our parents in their raincoats, faces blurred because of my bad eyesight. Or no, that isn’t true. I just see Maggie, always Maggie in her knickers by the crater where the magma was at some point in the Earth’s distant historic past. I see the magma bursting through, splitting the ground and streaming out in rapid torrents. There’d be a crater, after that, and over time the wind and air and intermittent rains and the footfalls of the humans and the animals would deepen it, they’d deepen the depression. Then the depression would be very deep. Held at its centre would be me and Maggie, and people might circle us to take our photographs, they’d start out close and then get further and further away inside their helicopters. In my head there’s nothing, just silence and darkness, me and Maggie side by side. We define the image, we form its core, we are the heart of it but nobody can see us and we cannot see each other, we can’t even see ourselves. We can only feel the ground beneath us, hard and dry, and made of stone."

    "text": "The day didn’t start well. I was going to be evicted for non-payment of rent and I had a fight with my girlfriend.

    I said Why don’t you put the lids back on jars properly so they don’t come off when I pick them up?
    
    She said You think you’re so political but it’s all just meaningless crap.
    
    I said I don’t really think your paintings are any good, I just say that to make you feel ok.
    
    She said Of all the people I’ve slept with you’re the most dull.
    
    I said I wish we were both dead.
    
    She said Goodbye.
    
     
    
    I sat there a while. I sat there a long while.
    
    Right, I said to myself, I’ll go out.
    
    Walking down the street I checked my phone. I had an email telling me I’d got the job. I’d got the job. I wouldn’t be evicted. I’d begin to get somewhere.
    
    I wanted to tell my girlfriend but I didn’t.
    
    I kept on walking. The sun was out.
    
     
    
    I decided to go and see my friend whose brother just died in an accident. He was on holiday in France and he fell off a roof.
    
    I said Is it ok just turning up?
    
    He said The thing is he’s in heaven.
    
    Ok I said.
    
    I don’t feel too bad he said because it must have been very quick and of course he’s in heaven now, he’s in bliss and he wasn’t when he was alive. And I do miss him but life’s quite short anyway so I’ll soon see him again.
    
    Do you feel you’re in touch with him? I said.
    
    Yes he said he’s watching over me just like when we were little and he was my big brother.
    
    That’s great I said, that’s amazing.
    
    Yes I’m surprised myself how ok it is he said.
    
     
    
    I went on down the street. I saw a homeless man I sometimes give money to.
    
    He said Hey good news. I’m getting housed. Not in a hostel, I’ve got a flat.
    
    Very good news I said. How did that happen?
    
    Haven’t you heard he said there’s a new government policy, get people off the streets by next week, double universal credit and build thousands of low-rent council flats. Oh and stop rich foreigners buying up places and not living in them.
    
    I said What? Really?
    
    Yes he said it’s a complete turnaround. Like the boats.
    
    What’s with the boats? I said.
    
    They’re going to let most people stay he said. They’ll have a proper system. I don’t know the detail but check it out. And I hate to ask he said but
    
    So I gave him the change in my pocket and on I went.
    
     
    
    My phone rang. Was it my girlfriend? No.
    
    My friend said Guess what? About my brother.
    
    What’s happened? I said.
    
    Turns out he’s ok he said. He didn’t die at all.
    
    I said Wow how that’s amazing news.
    
    He said Yeah, seems he was just knocked out and his friends panicked and sent the wrong message, he just broke his leg but not badly, he’s completely fine.
    
    I said So he’s not in heaven.
    
    No he said but this is better.
    
    Of course I said. You can both be in heaven later.
    
    Exactly he said.
    
     
    
    So the day was looking up. I went to the park. I liked the bare branches. The clouds and blue sky were rushing through.
    
    I suddenly had one of those I can’t find words for it one of those moments of joy I suppose it is.
    
    One of those.
    
    They don’t last but they’re good when they happen.
    
     
    
    I went to see my mother. I hadn’t been for a while and she’s not well. I didn’t mention about my girlfriend.
    
    She said I’ve got some news. I had a scan result this morning and the cancer’s gone.
    
    Gone? I said. Like in remission?
    
    They said there’s no trace of it she said. It’s not at all likely to come back.
    
    I gave her a hug. I picked up her favourite vase and waved it in the air and shouted.
    
    She said Careful with that. She said Thinking about dying and my life I thought about ways I failed you.
    
    I said You didn’t.
    
    She said Of course I did. Like when you had chickenpox and I was working and you were looked after by the neighbour with the scary dog.
    
    I said I wasn’t scared of the dog.
    
    Well she said lots of small things and I’m sorry. Just let me know any time if you’re feeling wronged.
    
    Thank you I said. I don’t expect I’ll need to.
    
    I just thought I’d say she said.
    
     
    
    We were having a cup of tea and a biscuit and the news was on.
    
    The news said Israel had stopped bombing Gaza and pulled out of the West Bank. There was going to be a big reconciliation and a complete rethink.
    
    I was speechless.
    
    My mother said That’s another then.
    
    What? What else? I said.
    
    You must have heard about Ukraine she said. They’ve stopped fighting and they’re sorting it out. And I think there’s something about Darfur. Everyone seems to be changing their attitude she said. Like they’ve cancelled the poor countries’ debts. It’s a complete change in the world economy and we can stop worrying about the climate.
    
    I nearly dropped my mug and I grabbed at it and my elbow caught the vase and it flew up in the air and I reached for it with my right hand but knocked it sideways and I went down low and knocked it up with my left hand and it went up in the air again and on its way down my mother caught it.
    
    She said That was lucky because it’s really fragile. I love that vase.
    
     
    
    By the time I got home it was getting dark. I missed my girlfriend. She was the one I wanted to talk to about all the things that were happening. I picked up the phone and she walked in the door.
    
    She said I’m sorry.
    
    I said No I’m sorry.
    
    She said I just get upset and say stuff.
    
    I said I do like your paintings really.
    
    She said I know they’re not good, I just like doing them.
    
    I said I like looking at them.
    
    She said And obviously I love making love with you.
    
    I said I don’t want to die after all and who cares about the lids of jars?
    
    Why don’t we just get married and have kids? she said.
    
    I said Yes. I said I was thinking that too.
    
    Later on I said But what about –?
    
    We’ll work it out she said.
    
    I said ok.
    
    So it turned out to be quite a good day."

    "text": "Alexis spotted their dad across the train station car park and texted their mum. She was allowed a phone once a month, just for these visits.

    ‘Ready?’ Alexis said. She took Ben’s hand and they ran, hunched over in the rain, dodging puddles to the car.
    
    ‘I want the blue side!’ Ben said. Like always, he insisted on sitting by the mismatched door.
    
    Rain pummelled the roof.
    
    ‘You look like drowned rats,’ their dad said.
    
    ‘Do we have to stay in a motel tonight?’ Ben asked.
    
    ‘Yeah, bit wet for camping.’
    
    They waited to turn out of the car park, their dad tapping his fingers on the steering wheel in time with the indicator tick.
    
    ‘So, what’s new?’
    
    ‘Not much,’ said Alexis. She had been invited to Juliet’s birthday party, a girl at the centre of a friendship group Alexis had been on the periphery of all year. She had begged her mum to let her go to the party instead, but her mum hadn’t wavered. It was their dad’s weekend. That was the rule. There’ll be other invites, she had said, not understanding that turning down an invitation left Alexis in a worse position than not being invited at all.
    
    ‘I lost another tooth,’ Ben said, baring his teeth and squishing his tongue in the canine gap.
    
    ‘Awesome, awesome,’ their dad said, but he wasn’t really listening. He turned the radio on, then off, then on again. He was always nervous at the start.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Their dad had been living with Mick, his old school friend, for two years. For the first year, Alexis and Ben visited their dad there, sleeping in a spare room with creaky beds. Mick had inherited the house from his grandparents and hadn’t changed the furniture. He went to church on Sundays, and seemed like an old person even though he was the same age as their dad. Once Alexis overheard Mick on the phone talking about their dad, saying he was while he battled some demons and found his feet, and she had imagined him in a cartoonish tumble of monsters and lightsabers.
    
    The last time they slept there, Alexis had been in the shower when Mick had come in and stared at her in the mirror while he brushed his teeth. The shower door was glass, and if she tried to cover herself it would have been like accusing him, so she stood still with the water running over her, aware of the scribble of new dark hairs between her legs. When Mick had finished brushing, he wiped his mouth with a wet hand and held a finger to his lips, shh. As soon as he left she had turned off the water and grabbed her towel. Outside the bathroom were raised voices.
    
    ‘You alright, Lexi?’ her dad had called through the door.
    
    ‘Yep!’ she had yelled back, pulling on her clothes in a rush.
    
    The rest of that day her dad had kept asking her if she was okay, and she kept saying she was fine. Later, he said, ‘This morning in the bathroom, Mick just wasn’t thinking. It won’t happen again. No need to say anything to your mum, eh?’
    
    Alexis didn’t need convincing. She hoped no one ever mentioned it again.
    
    They didn’t stay at Mick’s after that. In bad weather they went to a motel. In good weather they went camping, meaning they slept in the station wagon with the seats down flat, in a car park at a forest or beach. Their dad had a little gas stove for instant noodles, and at the supermarket he let them get whatever else they wanted – sweets and chips and sugary drinks, saying that he bet their mum never let them eat that stuff.
    
    It was true, she didn’t, but Alexis shrugged and said sometimes.
    
    On the camping weekends, even Ben knew better than to tell their mum exactly where they had slept and what they had eaten. On the train home Alexis brushed their hair and made Ben copy her, rubbing toothpaste on his teeth. For Ben the camping was all still fun, with the boundless choice in the supermarket, not washing, peeing against a tree and sleeping in his clothes. Alexis increasingly dreaded the awkwardness of having nowhere private to get changed, how the car filled up with the smell of their breath, the corrosive feeling in her mouth after all the sugar and salt.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    ‘You two are like peas in a pod,’ the motel receptionist said, nodding at Ben and their dad as she handed over the key. It was true – the crooked smile, the curls, but also the way their clothes seemed too big. Their dad was tall, but skinny in a way that looked like he wasn’t done growing. Once Ben asked their mum what a teenager was. She explained it was someone not quite a child anymore but not yet a proper adult.
    
    ‘Like Dad?’ Ben had said. Alexis had laughed at his mistake, but their mum had looked tired.
    
    ‘No, Ben, your father is an adult.’
    
    Alexis knew not to talk about Dad with her anymore, but Ben came back from their visits recounting things he had said, not noticing the uncomfortable, careful way she responded.
    
    ‘Dad said he’s gonna be his own boss soon.’
    
    ‘Well. Good for him.’
    
    ‘He’s gonna organise other people to paint houses so he doesn’t have to anymore.’
    
    ‘I hope that works out.’
    
    ‘Then will you get back together? He says you left cos he didn’t have a good job.’
    
    ‘No, Benny, this is the way things are now.’
    
    Alexis never wanted them back together. She was old enough to remember how it had been.
    
    The rainy day crawled along in the cramped motel room. They borrowed Monopoly from the reception, and Ben insisted on being the banker, even though he was slow and got the notes muddled. Their dad started going on about capitalism after landing on Park Lane, which Alexis owned. The game was abandoned to an argument.
    
    Alexis wondered what everyone was doing at Juliet’s. The unfairness of not being there stung.
    
    In the evening their dad got fish and chips. It was meant to be a treat, but Alexis didn’t feel like eating. Ben picked at the chips, his bottom lip protruding, still holding a grudge from Monopoly.
    
    ‘Eat up, you two,’ their dad said.
    
    ‘I’m not really hungry,’ Alexis said.
    
    ‘I only like chips with tomato sauce,’ said Ben. ‘And this sauce tastes funny.’
    
    ‘It’s just different to the one we have at home,’ Alexis said.
    
    ‘This is your home,’ their dad said.
    
    ‘This isn’t our home. It’s a motel,’ said Ben, perking up at the opportunity to correct an adult.
    
    ‘Wrong.’ Their dad grabbed some chips, stubbed them in the tub of sauce. ‘You’re here with me. So, you’re home.’
    
    ‘But we don’t have any of our stuff here.’
    
    ‘Stuff isn’t important. Doesn’t mean anything.’
    
    ‘What about school? We don’t go to school here,’ Ben said.
    
    ‘None of that matters.’ Their dad slammed his hand down. ‘You’re here with me.’
    
    No one said much after that. They watched a movie on the old TV about two bungling police officers. Their dad said it was a classic.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Alexis woke to pain in her stomach. The room was dark and still, and she could tell that their dad was out. The pain came and went, a dull stabbing. After a while, headlights glared through the thin curtain, swooped across the wall. Alexis pretended to sleep as he came in with shopping bags and his big backpack. She lay, not moving, and watched him pack it all, then slump, hunched and shaking. Crying, Alexis realised with a mixture of thrill and fear. He was crying.
    
    He kicked off his shoes and got into bed. The feeling in Alexis’s stomach subsided. She tried to stay awake to listen, but if he was crying it melded with the rattling hum of the mini fridge, the rain on the roof, the wind.
    
    In the morning, sun slanted in. Their dad was up and dressed, hair wet from a shower, and it was like Alexis had imagined the scene from the night before. They checked out and drove to the beach for a breakfast of chocolate biscuits in the dunes. It was too cold for swimming, but Ben and their dad dug a huge hole and channel to the sea, yelling encouragement at the waves to reach the hole. Alexis drew pictures in the sand with driftwood and signed her name with great swooping letters. She checked her phone, but there was nothing to see. When her mum had first given her the phone, it had felt, momentarily, like a gate opening to a new world. But her mum made it clear it was only for emergencies, and only for these visits. She had blocked it from downloading apps, and her mum was the only one with the number. Alexis’s argument that other people her age had their own phones hadn’t swayed her at all.
    
    Alexis had been given the phone after the visit in March when their dad hadn’t turned up at the station. Trains had rumbled past and Ben had whined about being hungry and bored. Alexis had been hungry and bored too, but there was no one for her to whine to and nothing to do except sit and wait.
    
    The man from the ticketing window had come over.
    
    ‘You two look like lost luggage,’ he had said, and lent Alexis his phone. She had tried their dad twice, but he didn’t pick up. So she had to call their mum, and because there wasn’t a train for two hours, she had driven an hour to collect them. She had just pulled up and they were about to get in her car when their dad arrived. He stopped so his car blocked hers from leaving and got out. Their mum wound down her window.
    
    ‘No way!’ he said. ‘This is my night.’
    
    ‘Nope. You weren’t here, so they’re coming home with me.’
    
    ‘A mate was helping fix my car, it took longer than we thought.’ His grey car had a blue door where the dented one had been.
    
    ‘So what? They’re kids! You don’t just leave them waiting for hours.’
    
    ‘Chill out, they were fine.’
    
    ‘They were scared.’
    
    Neither was right.
    
    ‘One night, Justine. One night a month.’ Their dad had turned to Alexis and Ben who were still standing by their mum’s car. ‘You guys wanna come with me, right?’
    
    ‘You don’t have to,’ their mum said. ‘You can come home.’
    
    Alexis had wished there was a third option, something that would beam her up and away from the car park, and this contest between her parents that went on and on, with barbed little victories but never a resolution. Ben tugged at her hand and she let him decide.
    
    ‘New door!’ he said.
    
    ‘That’s right,’ their dad had said, opening it like a chauffeur, standing wide, waving them in. Alexis had hated his look of triumph.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    The wind whipped up the sand on the beach, so they walked over the dunes to the playground with the skulking seagulls. Alexis sat on a swing and scuffed her feet. Their dad stood, watching Ben climb up the slide, and Alexis thought he might cry again.
    
    ‘Can I have a push to get started?’ she called out, although she hadn’t needed that for years.
    
    He came over and pulled the swing back, making a beeping sound like a reversing truck. As he let go, Alexis dropped her head back and the sky lurched. She moved her legs in and out, swinging until the chains juddered at the top of the arc as if they were trying to buck her off.
    
    On the way to the station Ben complained that they hadn’t had lunch.
    
    ‘I can’t send you back hungry,’ their dad said, and stopped at the mall. Alexis’s stomach felt heavy. She didn’t want food, she wanted to be home. This meant they would have to wait until the 3 o’clock train. In the bakery their dad filled a bag with cakes and pastries. It was too much, far more than they could eat. Her stomach twisted. That stabbing feeling again.
    
    ‘I need to go to the toilet,’ she said.
    
    ‘Okay, see you back at the car.’
    
    Alexis walked through the mall. Her parents had met here, working at shops that didn’t exist anymore, her mum an apprentice in the hair salon, her dad at the butcher’s, both just out of school, only six years older than Alexis. All her mother ever said about that time was that they were way too young. In the bathroom, the air thick with pine air freshener not quite masking the other smells, Alexis twisted the lock closed and sat down.
    
    There was a reddish smudge in her underpants. She wiped herself and there were more streaks of red on the paper. It was her first time. She knew what it was – from her mum and from a session at school where boys had been ushered out of the classroom and girls were shown diagrams about how to use tampons and pads. Not many people in her class had their period yet, or had admitted to having it. They had all been told it was natural and normal and nothing to be ashamed of. But boys playing lunchtime cricket at school had found a tampon once, and took turns throwing the little white bullet at each other, full of derision and disgust. Accusations had circled about whose pocket it had dropped from. Alexis had been mentioned, and like everyone else she had denied it – no way, as if – but she felt tainted all the same.
    
    She folded toilet paper into a wad and put it in her underpants, hoping it would last the couple of hours until she was home.
    
    Leaving the bathroom, she was sure people were staring. Could everybody see? A group of teenagers erupted into laughter as she passed and her face burned, thinking the blood must be showing. But she glanced sideways and they were in a huddle, fixated on one of their phones.
    
    Ben and her dad were waiting in the car.
    
    ‘You were ages,’ Ben said with a mouth full of cake.
    
    Their dad said they had time to kill and drove in the opposite direction to the train station. The town wasn’t big. Within a few streets, houses were sparse, then they were driving past farmland, cows and sheep and mathematical rows of something green. Their dad had started doing that thing, where he talked on and on, looking at them in the rear-view mirror.
    
    ‘The thing is, the system gears us to be dissatisfied with what we have. It’s like sugar. They load it into everything – bread, mayonnaise, you name it. So basically, we’re all addicted. We crave it, but we need more and more of it to actually taste sweetness. Go back and measures of status were different. Cars? Didn’t exist. En suites? There wasn’t indoor plumbing! A few hundred years ago if you got to my age with your own teeth in your head you were winning.’
    
    Ben didn’t even pretend to listen. He dabbed his finger against his tongue and made a pattern on the car window with his spit. Alexis just wanted him to keep his eyes on the road as it got steeper and winding. She guessed he was taking them to a forest park where they had camped a couple of times. Alexis didn’t like staying there. Even on nice days it felt gloomy, closed in by trees and mountains, and it was popular with hunters, who frightened Alexis with their guns strapped to their backs and their bristling, impatient dogs. Now her dad was talking about food productivity. The toilet paper between her legs was bunched up and uncomfortable. They drove past the entrance to the car park where they had stayed, and then turned off down a narrow, unsealed road, with bush pressing in each side. They needed to turn around now if they had any hope of making the 3 o’clock train.
    
    ‘Dad? Shouldn’t we be heading back?’ she said.
    
    ‘There’s no reason for anyone to be going hungry.’
    
    ‘Dad?’
    
    ‘There are 400 golf courses in New Zealand alone. 400!’ A few minutes later he came to a stop, motor still running. ‘Out we get.’
    
    Alexis and Ben stood at the side of the road. He opened the boot and unpacked their bags.
    
    ‘What about the train?’ Alexis said, but he was back in the car, wheels spinning on stones, and then he was gone. The sound of the car faded and the silence left behind was too big.
    
    ‘Is he coming back?’ Ben whispered.
    
    Alexis had no idea.
    
    ‘Yeah, of course,’ she said, like he was dumb for asking.
    
    ‘What if he doesn’t? I’m hungry.’
    
    ‘Eat, then.’ Alexis nudged the bag from the bakery that was at their feet. ‘God, don’t be such a baby,’ she said, trying to keep her own worry in check, sick of having to be the one to reassure.
    
    She got the phone out of her backpack. There was no reception. Ben sat down, eating a donut quickly and unhappily. The sun dipped behind the trees and the drop in temperature was immediate.
    
    ‘Jacket on,’ she said, making her voice soft. Ben hated his jacket because it was yellow and used to be Alexis’s and still had her name written inside. But when she held it out he put it on without complaining. She wiped cream from the corner of his mouth and handed him a chocolate milk. She was going to take one too, but worried that drinking would make more blood come.
    
    ‘Dad’ll be back real soon, Benny. Any minute.’ As if on cue he jogged into view.
    
    ‘Man, you should see your worried faces!’ he laughed, and stood hands on hips, catching his breath. ‘Good news! It’s camping time. I spoke to your mum earlier and she agreed you can stay another night.’
    
    ‘Where’s the car?’ Alexis asked.
    
    ‘I had to find a spot for it. There’s no room to park here.’
    
    ‘Where are we going to sleep?’
    
    He gestured to the forest behind her. ‘In there.’ She hadn’t noticed the start of a track.
    
    ‘We’re going to do proper camping. I’ve got a new tent.’ He hoisted on his backpack, so bulky that he almost lost his balance. ‘Ready for an adventure?’
    
    He started walking. Ben put on his own bag and scrambled after him and all Alexis could do was follow. The track was overgrown, or maybe it had never been well-formed. Orange tags nailed onto trees marked the route. Leaves held on to yesterday’s rain and dampened her clothes as she passed. Mud sucked at her sneakers. Had their mum really said they could stay? They had missed a visit two months ago when she and Ben were sick. It was possible she’d agreed to make up for that. But with school the next day? And there was the other problem. Alexis slowed down, slipped her hand down the front of her jeans and touched her underpants. Her fingers came back red. She called out that she needed to go to the toilet.
    
    ‘We’ll wait,’ her dad called back.
    
    She found a spot hidden by bushes and pulled down her jeans. The toilet paper was sodden and shocking red. She scuffed a hole in the earth with her heel and dropped the wad in and covered it. Blood was showing through on the outside of her jeans. She opened her bag trying to find something to use, but they never brought much with them. It was only meant to be one night.
    
    ‘You okay, Lexi?’ her dad called out, and she could see him through the trees, coming towards her. She grabbed a sock and stuffed it in her underpants.
    
    ‘Coming,’ she called back, pulling up her jeans. She took off her jacket and tied it around her waist.
    
    She thought about telling him. Maybe he would say they could go back. But did men even know about it? What if he didn’t understand, or he didn’t believe her? What if he wanted to see?
    
    ‘Here, have some water. This walking is thirsty work.’
    
    He handed her a bottle. She took it and pretended to drink.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    They perched on a log, eating instant noodles. Alexis was relieved it was nearly dark. She couldn’t see the state of her jeans, which meant neither could Ben or her dad. Alexis only ate the noodles, tilting her bowl and pouring out the liquid when they weren’t looking. Their dad packed away the gas cooker and said it was time to go.
    
    ‘We’re not staying here?’ she said.
    
    ‘We’d roll down the hill in our sleep. We’ll be on flat ground soon.’
    
    ‘But it’s dark,’ Ben said.
    
    ‘Good thing I thought ahead.’ He rummaged in a pocket of his backpack then dangled a headlamp in front of each of them. ‘Told you this would be an adventure.’
    
    He helped adjust the elastic, showed them where the on button was, and they set off again. Three bright eyes in the night.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Alexis stared at the blank blue of the tent wall. She had almost believed their mum had agreed to an extra night. But in the lamplight last night, when her dad was getting the tent out of his pack, she’d seen a big bag of rice, packets of noodles, extra gas canisters, enough for days and days – far more days than their mum would ever agree to. She could see now it was all deliberate, walking on this track that didn’t even have a sign, the car parked who knows where. He didn’t want them to be found. But the longer it went on the more trouble he would be in – and not just from their mum.
    
    She rolled over carefully. Ben was a scruff of hair at the top of the sleeping bag next to her, and her dad was a featureless mound on the other side. She gathered her things, and eased up the tent zip, glad that sleeping through anything was another way her dad and brother were the same.
    
    Outside it was light, but not fully, like the colour of the world was still getting turned up. Everything was covered by a soft fuzz of moss, and beech trees stretched up towards the brightening sky. Walking at night, it had seemed the trees were props that sprung up when she shone her light on them and collapsed again when they were in the dark. Now she could see the trees went on forever.
    
    Alexis moved away from the tent and squatted down, but no wee came out. The sock had moved out of place in her sleep and her underpants and jeans were a mess. She smelled bad down there. Not drinking was working though, she noted with relief. The blood was coming out thicker and darker, like it was drying up. It was worth feeling thirsty.
    
    She needed to start walking.
    
    The day before they had walked for five hours, maybe six. Her phone had run out of battery and her had dad said the time didn’t matter. If she left now she could maybe contact her mum by lunchtime, they could be home in the afternoon, and sleep in their own beds that night. Maybe it could all be explained as a misunderstanding.
    
    There was the matter of her jeans. She needed to find a river or a stream to wash herself. They hadn’t crossed any on the track walking in, but she thought she had heard water a few times. Then, when she was clean, she would find the road and walk until she saw people and could ask to call her mum. A river then the road, she repeated in her head. She found an orange track marker nailed to a tree and started to walk.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Water. She was sure of it. She turned sideways to edge down the slope, using trees as handrails to steady herself. But where it seemed there should be water, there was only the sound of it, and more forest, more slope. She kept going down until she reached the bottom of a gully. There might have been a river there once but she had heard only the ghost of it, or a trick of the wind, because there was no water there now. She had wasted what, an hour? She started climbing. It was slower, and harder, pulling herself up. When she thought she had climbed enough, she looked for a marker on a tree but there were none. The forest made false paths, with tree roots suggesting stairs, ferns seeming to line a trail, before ending in a rock or a drop or a dense tangle of bush.
    
    Her tongue felt like carpet, throat like sand. She would give anything for a drink. It had been dumb not to take any food from the tent. She sat down and looked through her bag, just in case. Toothpaste? She squeezed the tube into her mouth, thinking it might at least get rid of the rough feeling, but the gob of gel was thick and gummy. She didn’t have enough saliva to spit it out so had to wipe her tongue on her sleeve.
    
    The sun was beyond its high point so it must be afternoon. It had been in front of them yesterday, and so if she kept it behind her, surely she would reach a road eventually. She made herself stand, made herself keep going.
    
    The sun tracked its way across the sky. Had anyone walked here, ever?
    
    The trees thinned and she hoped, briefly, that she was coming to the edge of the forest. She imagined emerging into a backyard with white sheets flapping on a washing line. But no. She stood on a rocky ledge, and the ground dropped away and a valley spread out before her. There were mountains waiting behind the mountains. The low sun caught on the seam of water far below, turning the surface gold. She had found her river, but it was impossible to reach.
    
    Wind blew and she could see its progress, a huge invisible hand skimming across the trees like velvet pushed the wrong way.
    
    It would be cold soon. Everything ached. Pain knuckled her head. Her tongue was too big for her mouth. Her body was a too-heavy thing she was sick of hauling around. Time to rest.
    
    Back in the forest, Alexis found a hollow in the earth beside a fallen beech tree. It would fit her fine. She lay on her side, the way she always fell asleep. She pulled her green jacket around her. The ferns formed an awning and the tree was reassuring against her back. Nothing here minded the blood. The smell of her was just another smell alongside sap and damp earth and rotting wood. She was lost luggage. Her mum would come and get her, or her dad would find her. Next to her face, her hand was resting on fallen beech leaves, each the size of a fingernail and coloured dark green, or red, or brown the same shade as her hair. Alexis shut her eyes.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    The white dog moves through the night forest, a whorl of muscle and intention. Time is running out. His people are tired. He absorbs the scents from the earth, the scents in the air, his whole being filtering them.
    
    Then – there – a scent, pulling him along a ridge, over rocks, moss, through the bush. There is nothing elective to this movement. The scent splits, intensifies, and he slows, nose to the ground. He is close. Tree, tree, tree, ferns, girl.
    
    She is oil and salt and a streak of chemical mint and blood. Most of all she is blood. Wounded? He nudges at her. Not wound blood, but her own, old, and new.
    
    The girl jerks and opens her eyes. Fear rises off her like steam. He inhales it, and the hairs on his neck stiffen automatically, his mouth ready to snarl. But she doesn’t move, just lies, body tense, breath like she has been running. Then, because he has been so long, two faint whistle blasts. He tilts his head towards the sound, then back to consider her. He whines. He could bark. He could draw his people here.
    
    No. She is not the animal they need.
    
    And he is off, running again through the scents, trying to find a good one, before the night is done."

    "text": "When Jean was nearly seventeen years old, she instigated an affair with a house painter in his early forties who played drums in a Beatles cover band. Her boyfriend had asked her to go with him to the all-ages early show at a bar that was usually only for people who were over twenty-one. They quickly saw that even at the early show the crowd was still mostly people their parents’ age, though neither set of parents would come to a place like this. Jean could think of a few of their teachers who might, but none of them were there either. Maybe they were waiting for the late show? Jean had driven so that her boyfriend could eat some psychedelic mushroom caps he’d foraged a few days earlier and dried at home with a lamp whose intended function was to regulate his little brother’s iguana’s body heat.

    ‘You’ll be okay?’ she asked as he unbuckled his seat belt with a demeanor indicating that whatever had happened to him was still happening to him. They were parked in his driveway and she could see the play of TV light on the drawn curtains in the living room.
    
    ‘The world is just the truth,’ he said. ‘There isn’t anything extra.’ Jean did not agree, but he hadn’t phrased it as a question. He leaned in to kiss her and she turned her face slightly to the side. If she allowed him a full kiss he might say something else ridiculous, perhaps about the fundamental strangeness of a ritual that involved touching tongues.
    
    Instead of going home she drove back to the bar. In the parking lot, under the glow of the dome light with her face framed in the mirror of the flipped-down sunshade, she applied a layer of makeup that made her look like someone older who was trying to look younger. Her boyfriend kept a spare pack of cigarettes in her glove box and she took one, though she did not smoke. She walked up to the bar holding it and said hello to the bouncer, who gave a nod and waved her in.
    
    The late show drink special was two-for-one daiquiris because it was Wednesday. This was Florida, in the late 1990s, in a strip mall on Griffin Road, thirty or forty minutes to the north and west of what you’d probably think of if someone said ‘Miami’. Until relatively recently, this had been part of the Everglades, the famous River of Grass, a unique, irreplaceable wonder of the Earth that was being methodically drained for developments such as the one where Jean lived, the one where her boyfriend lived, the high school they attended, and this strip mall.
    
    Jean had not planned further than achieving re-entry to the bar. She probably would have turned around and left but just then the performance began. It felt natural to drift toward the front of the room, to a cocktail table shared by a couple, where there was an empty third chair. She asked if they minded if she sat. They said no, not at all, please join them. The man introduced himself as Grayson and the woman as Cori, short for Corinth, not Corinne like most people would assume. They explained this in husky whispers while the band warmed up the crowd with ‘I’ve Got a Feeling’. Grayson wore a green Lacoste shirt tucked into his jeans; Cori wore white stretch pants and a floral peasant top that was as long as a short dress. They both wore Birkenstocks and expensive rings and it was clear they were reliving their own youth or some version of it that they’d seen on television and over the years had come to believe had been their own. They hadn’t quite dressed the part for whatever they thought they were doing, but they were having a good time and Jean recognized that she herself was playing dress-up, so what was it to her. Grayson got up to get a drink and Cori told Jean she had a good aura. The band played ‘Ticket to Ride’, then ‘Nowhere Man’, both of which Jean had heard at the early show. Next they played ‘Taxman’ and everyone started cheering because it was April. The drummer sang lead and he had an excited sneer in his voice when he sang lines like ‘Be thankful I don’t take it all.’ This was Leon. The audience whooped and booed, thinking of cruel and beloved Uncle Sam, who gave them their freedoms but also said pay up or else.
    
    Grayson returned to the table with a pint of beer in one hand and two strawberry daiquiris teetering in the other. ‘They were two for one,’ he said. ‘So I figured.’ Jean thanked Grayson and accepted the drink. It was sickly sweet but also tart, like a Pixy Stick. She liked that the crushed ice chilled her while the cheap rum warmed her. She liked that she already felt like a regular at this bar though she didn’t particularly like this bar. She had a good view of the drummer from where she was sitting and she liked his voice and the fact that he was a singing drummer. She decided to introduce herself to him after the show.
    
    When the show ended, she thanked Grayson again for the drink and said goodnight to him and to Cori, who leaned in and kissed her on the cheek. The couple left and Jean walked toward the stage, where the band was packing up their equipment, unplugging various cords and wrapping them tightly, using their forearms or fists as spools.
    
    Leon had curly hair that was not yet entirely gray. He had worn it in a stumpy ponytail while he played but now it hung freely about his ears. Jean had straight black hair that spilled nearly to her waist. She was tall and sturdy in bootcut jeans and a loose white shirt of her father’s, untucked, with the sleeves rolled up and the top buttons undone so you could see the gray ribbed tank top underneath. People often took her for Native American, which she half was – her mother was a registered member of the Cowlitz nation – but she always denied this when asked. She had no shame about her heritage. She only hid it because of how weird people could get about it. This was a few years after Disney’s Pocahantas and she had been asked more times than she cared to remember whether she could paint with all the colors of the wind. In the seventh grade her math teacher had told the whole class that the land on which the school sat was rightfully Jean’s. She’d raised her hand and explained that the Cowlitz were Native to the opposite side of the country and that this was, if anything, Tequesta and Seminole land, though the history of the Seminole tribe as a tribe was complicated, being largely an epiphenomenon (she didn’t use this word) of resistance to colonization and chattel slavery, and anyway the land wasn’t really anyone’s, it was the Everglades. Or it had used to be. Her parents had met at Stanford and were no more native to South Florida than whites, Cubans, or anyone else. The teacher had been afraid to interrupt her while she spoke, but when the bell rang he held her back and handed her a detention slip for being disruptive. After that, she answered all queries about her heritage by saying that her father was an emotionally abusive Jewish real estate lawyer. Nobody had any more questions after that, and the statement had the further virtue of being true.
    
    Decades later, a therapist in Chicago would ask her whether she thought there was a causal link between her complicated feelings about her father, who had recently died after a long battle with stomach cancer, and her affair with the middle-aged drummer when she was sixteen. ‘Nearly seventeen,’ Jean would correct him, and she would say she did not see any link and would mean it, but she would not be believed. She’d only mentioned Leon at all because it had occurred to her while talking about her father that the two men were roughly the same age, and she wondered whether Leon was still alive. Also, that the period of the affair had tracked closely with the period of her father’s worst emotional abuse, the dark time which had preceded and ultimately resulted in his entering therapy, though by that point the affair with Leon had ended. Jean’s therapist would assure her that he understood correlation was not necessarily causation but that in this case, well – come on! He would say this to her: ‘Come on!’ She would end the therapeutic relationship on the spot. He would object in strenuous terms, and then fall to pleading, which would strike Jean not only as inappropriate but pathetic. She found displays of male weakness repulsive; they hardened her heart against whoever was blubbering in front of her. The therapist told her that the affair with Leon had left her emotionally arrested and that this was not only the reason she was still single – being incapable, as a perpetual adolescent, of adult relationships – but was also the reason why she had chosen a high school teaching career and now spent her days around teenagers. He told her she was living in a self-made cage that only he could free her from and if she did not continue her treatment, she was likely to fall into a situation with one of her own charges that would reproduce what had happened to her, but she would be the perpetrator this time. She laughed aloud when he said that, a vital disbelieving laugh that captured the absolute contempt in which she now held him. She had never once considered a sexual relationship with one of her students, not even the most attractive or emotionally mature of them, any more than she had considered a sexual relationship with one of her teachers when she was a student. She was a good and committed educator and had always believed, rightly or wrongly, that her experience with Leon had been unique, self-contained, and without lasting consequence: entirely her own. That had been the point of it from the start. And it was for that reason that she had never told the story to anyone before.
    
    She’d liked his ropy forearms and his chinos with frayed cuffs, the fact that he wore flip-flop sandals like life was a beach, and that the sandals never caught on a drum pedal or amp cord when he played. He always wore band T-shirts, onstage as well as off, but never for the band that his band pretended to be. It was all groups he’d seen, mostly in the 80s, such as Aerosmith and the Allman Brothers. But the first night she’d seen him play – and then again three weeks later when she returned to the bar to reintroduce herself and make her interest unmistakable – Leon wore a T-shirt commemorating the Steely Dan 1993 World Tour. The shirt featured the band’s name in hideous blue below a tableau of national flags arranged vortically around an electric guitar the same hideous color as the band name. The graphics were printed on white cotton that reminded her of the phys ed uniform she’d had to wear in middle school, which was where she had been the year of this tour.
    
    She sat again with Cori and Grayson, who said they’d missed her. It dawned on Jean with muted horror that these people came to this place to see this band every Wednesday of their lives. Leon was singing the lead on ‘Carry That Weight’. She told the couple that she was twenty-three years old and working as an in-home caregiver for the elderly and disabled. It was contract work and the hours were unpredictable; she hoped to save up and go back to school to finish a teaching certificate. They accepted all of this without question, which gave Jean confidence that Leon would as well. Grayson treated her to another BOGO daiquiri and she drank it as fast as she could.
    
    Leon did believe her story – why wouldn’t he? – and she stuck to it for three months. After school let out for the summer she had fewer hours of unavailability to account for and that made things easier. Her boyfriend was away being a camp counselor in Maine. She told Leon that the reason they could never go to her apartment was because she had an agoraphobic roommate who would listen to them through the wall with a cup to her ear. Leon suggested she move. He didn’t like to think of her living with someone who was both mentally ill and a pervert. Jean said this was a good idea, but you know how these things take time. Leon did know. He’d been there. And as far as the two of them were concerned, it was fine to always go to his apartment. He didn’t care.
    
    Leon was generous in all ways: as a listener, as a lover. If they split an entrée, he was careful not to eat more than his share. Boys her own age (and, later, men her own age) were always saying they were cool with splitting an entrée, especially if they were treating, but they counted on you not eating more than three bites of the steak or whatever it was. Jean liked to eat her share of food and she liked that Leon liked for her to do this. He would have showered her with gifts all the time if he’d had any money. Her birthday was approaching and she had mentioned it in the hope that he would do something special for her. Nothing expensive, just special. She reminded herself that, as far as Leon knew, she was turning twenty-four.
    
    He lived in a humid ground floor apartment in a building on a canal near a massive outlet mall that when viewed from above was revealed to have the shape of an alligator. Alligators had been common here before the Everglades was drained to build the alligator-shaped mall. When the mall had opened in 1990, Jean vaguely remembered, the local news had sent up a helicopter so everyone could see what it looked like from above. When you were inside the mall it did not feel like being inside of an alligator. There was no sense that this particular store or corridor was in the snout or tail or claw. Mostly you knew which food court you were closest to, the one with the fresh-baked pretzel kiosk or the one with the teriyaki chicken place that gave out free samples. Toothpicks in rows straight as veterans’ gravestones sticking out of chunks of glistening meat each the size of a throat lozenge. The platter was held by an employee in a red apron and matching hairnet who would not look you in the eye but wouldn’t scold you if you came back for a second sample.
    
    Jean’s family lived in a monied suburb south and slightly to the west of this mall. They lived at what was now the frontier of the Everglades, though it wouldn’t always be. Jean’s father, who’d had a hand in making their subdivision possible, sometimes stood in their back yard and looked out toward the flat horizon and told Jean or her mother or the maid, whoever was around, that someday soon there’d be a Starbucks and a Shell station out there. He was right.
    
    In the fifth and sixth grades, Jean would go to the outlet mall with her girlfriends to cruise the long body of the alligator. They’d dip fingers into fountains and flick the water. They’d laugh at lingerie in display windows and take second samples of chicken. One time Jean went back for thirds. She’d met no resistance from the employee and returned to the girls in triumph, with the morsel in her mouth and the toothpick poking from between her grinning lips, but something had shifted in the mere moments that she’d been away. She’d looked at her girlfriends uncomprehendingly, searching each stony face for a clue. The sweet gooey chicken, still unswallowed, was cooling on her tongue.
    
    ‘You can be such a piggy sometimes,’ Charlene Stevens said, and then all five girls turned on their heels like it was something they’d practiced, which for all Jean knew, they had.
    
    Now she went to the outlet mall with Leon. Not only was it cheap but she was sure she’d never see anyone she knew there. All the kids from her school went to the fancy mall on the other side of town. Nobody wanted anything from an outlet store. Leon and Jean were free to hold hands while they strolled. She tried on some of the lingerie that she and her friends used to gawk and howl about. She thought lingerie was silly but it wasn’t as though she didn’t understand the principles involved. She’d taken AP Psych! Her parents paid for HBO! She was coming to understand that sex was a secret you shared with another person, but sexiness was sort of a joke that you were in on with yourself. She stood in the changing room before the full-length mirror, admiring herself in a matching bra and panty set the color of fresh blood, as bright as if it were oozing from a newly scraped knee. She closed her eyes to make sure she really liked the fit, and not merely the look, of the garments. Leon stood on the other side of the curtain, being chivalrous and very excited because, this being the outlet mall, and the garments in question on clearance besides, he would be able to afford the set and so insisted on purchasing it for her as a gift for what he believed was her twenty-fourth birthday. She handed the garments to him around the side of the curtain and he went to pay and have them wrapped while she put her regular clothes back on.
    
    Jean asked if he’d like to split a plate of teriyaki chicken over rice. He said he would be happy to share with her. They walked to the food court and over to the restaurant stall and stopped at the free sample station as though considering their options, though the decision had already been made. The employee holding the platter today was a short plump woman with gold clasps high on her earlobe cartilage. She was wearing latex gloves that were translucent enough to reveal a dreamcatcher tattoo down the side of the index finger of the hand with which she proffered napkins in case anyone wanted to wipe their mouths. The dreamcatcher design included an eagle feather that dangled down to her fingertip.
    
    ‘Norma!’ Leon said when he saw the tattoo. He’d not yet looked at the woman’s face nor she at his, but he’d have known that tattoo anywhere. He’d been there when she’d gotten it, had in fact supplied the Vicodin that had made the procedure bearable. Some people found transcendent calm or even ecstasy in submitting to the tattooist’s needle, but not Norma. She and Leon had been living together at the time. Norma looked from Leon’s face to Jean’s face and then to the paper bag Jean held, the name of the store emblazoned on its wide side.
    
    ‘Oh boy,’ Norma said. ‘Don’t look now.’ But she already had.
    
    Leon and Norma caught up for a couple of minutes, not getting overly sentimental or specific in their reminiscences, except about a mutual friend named Arnold Anderson who had died a few years earlier. They both knew he’d overdosed but avoided saying so. They only said what a shame it was. Jean was not jealous. It made sense to her that people would have histories. When she had a history of her own, this would be part of it. She was over by the counter waiting for the food, which she’d already ordered and paid for. ‘It looks like you’ve got your life all figured out,’ she heard Leon say to Norma.
    
    Norma replied, ‘Well, I’m hanging in there.’
    
    ‘Yeah, that’s it,’ Leon said, with a forced cheer intended to direct the conversation to its end. ‘Hanging in and not hanging out.’
    
    They took their food to a table far from the chicken stall. With their sporks they scooped and poked into the hot wet heap of meat and rice.
    
    ‘Sorry about that,’ Leon said. ‘I hope it didn’t put a dampener on this wonderful day we were having.’ Jean assured him that it did not. To prove it, she asked a few questions about Norma and those bygone times. Leon answered dutifully, even when the answers cast him in a less than flattering light, as far as the overall way he’d been living back then and what had led to the break up. But all that was a long time ago, even before the 1993 Steely Dan world tour, the commemorative shirt from which Leon happened to be wearing yet again.
    
    Jean appreciated that Leon was so emphatic in his performance of candor, on top of the fact that he actually seemed to be being candid. Beneath his honesty about the squalid chaos of the Norma days, Jean sensed, there was genuine affection for Norma herself that wasn’t yet abated and that he hoped not to trouble her with. She thought this a sign of sophistication and respect and wanted to demonstrate a maturity commensurate with his own. So after they’d returned to his apartment, and she’d duly donned, modeled, and been relieved of the birthday lingerie, and they were lying sweaty flank to flank in the narrow bed the apartment had come furnished with, she told him that there was something about her upcoming birthday that she needed him to know. He laughed and turned her face toward his by touching his pointer finger to her chin and gently pushing her head. He said women always lied about their ages. He had figured this was coming and it was okay if she was really twenty-eight or even thirty. Women thought thirty was a big deal, Leon said, when really it was nothing. You could easily view it as still being the start of your life.
    
    ‘Oh boy,’ Jean said, quoting Norma from earlier without realizing it. She no longer wanted to tell him the truth but there was no obvious way out of the conversation and she was too proud or honest to take the lifeline he did not know he had thrown her.
    
    All the color drained from Leon’s face. He jumped out of the narrow bed, accidentally pulling the top sheet with him so Jean was fully revealed. She sat up. A scream stalled in Leon’s throat as he threw the sheet over her. She looked like a child pretending to be a ghost. He grabbed his pants from where they lay on the scratchy brown carpet that always felt a little damp even when it definitely wasn’t. He ran with pants in-hand to the bathroom and locked the door. She could hear him crying on the far side of it while she dressed.
    
    ‘I could be in prison!’ he yelled. ‘I might never see my kids!’
    
    Jean apologized a few times but she was getting impatient. She was annoyed by his refusal to come out of the bathroom. She had not meant to precipitate a breakup but since it was happening she felt that they ought to do it face to face. This in the name of that same maturity that had provoked the honesty that had ruined everything. But that didn’t matter anymore, and neither did mutual respect, apparently. Leon would not see her. He would not discuss things. He had stopped responding to her entirely. She was already in the rearview mirror of his life, one more thing that had seemed so promising as he’d approached it, but was now bitterly relieved to see receding behind him to a speck and then to nothing at all. If she hadn’t still been able to hear his hitched breath and quiet crying she might have guessed he’d climbed out the bathroom window, like in that one Beatles song he sang, but in reverse. She was one more thing he would count himself lucky to have survived.
    
    Jean didn’t see Leon again for nearly a year. Then she happened to see him twice in the same week. On a Sunday she had gone with her age-appropriate boyfriend (a different one) to a free all-day local music festival in a city park. She had noticed that Leon’s band was on the bill and so had known that they might run into each other because it wasn’t like the musicians were tucked away in some fancy backstage area. It was the kind of scene where everyone mingled and hung around. A sign said that the purpose of the festival was to raise money to save the Everglades. The music was free and the idea was that the money you would have spent on a ticket to the concert would be given as a donation to the organization that had sponsored the festival. The organization’s goal was to raise awareness. Their private expectation was to recoup in donations slightly less than half of what it had cost to stage the festival.
    
    Jean’s current boyfriend was unlike the last one in almost every way, but the boyfriends did have one thing in common, which was a desire to take drugs to establish a deeper relationship with music they already knew. Jean had driven to the festival so that her boyfriend was free to get as high as he wanted to get. He’d figured he’d be able to find some psychedelics once they got there, but he failed. He went back to the parking lot. In the car he had stashed three Xanax that he had taken from a bottle his mother had been prescribed after a minor car accident. He chased these with glugs from a plastic water bottle that he’d filled with vodka that morning. It had sat in the hot car for hours and he felt proud at being able to keep it down.
    
    Jean had expected this to be a long day and her expectation was being met. She had agreed to come in part because the prospect of running into Leon excited her. Not that she was hoping to run into him, just that it was exciting to know that she might. Maybe he’d apologize for his behavior, the crying and locking himself away. She felt she was owed this. She also felt she owed him an apology about creating a situation that could have possibly affected his visitation with his children. She hadn’t known about that at the time. Maybe Norma would be with him and there would be a dramatic scene.
    
    None of that happened. Her boyfriend overheated in the midday sun. She took him to the medical tent and left him there. She stood at the back of the crowd during Leon’s band’s set. She wasn’t hiding, she was simply more comfortable out of the crush by the stage. The band wasn’t doing Beatles covers that day. They played a few originals, songs Jean remembered Leon playing for her in private – demos the guys had recorded, or sometimes he’d pluck one out on his acoustic guitar and sing it for her – then they did the Allman Brothers instrumental ‘Melissa’, from which they attempted an improvised segue into ‘Blue Sky’, also an Allmans tune. The lead guitar player’s work during the segue was labored and Jean could see the frustration on Leon’s face as he drummed. Or maybe she was imagining that, because she was still at the back of the crowd, but she did remember what his face looked like when he was frustrated. Leon had complained to Jean about the lead guitar player many times. She had once suggested firing him from the band but Leon said they had grown up here together and he would never betray a friend even if the friend was a middling talent and sometimes a pain in the ass. Besides, the lead guitar player owned the band’s van.
    
    Now the lead guitar player said into the mic, ‘We’re gonna bring it down for a minute, folks,’ and then turned to Leon, who hit the kick drum and the snare at once, inaugurating the new song, on which he would sing the lead. The song began, ‘By and by, girl, we’ll get over things we’ve done and the things we’ve said.’ Jean did not recognize this song, which was from Steely Dan co-founder Walter Becker’s solo record 11 Tracks of Whack, which had come out in 1994, the year after Leon had seen the Steely Dan world tour. Jean thought that this was another original song and that Leon had written it, since he was singing it. She began to fantasize that he had written it for, or rather about, her. When he sang the chorus, in which the line ‘There’s a star in the book of liars by your name’ is repeated twice, she felt gooseflesh ripple down her bare arms despite the heat of the afternoon. She was absolutely certain that this was her song.
    
    The set ended and the band was still packing up but Leon seemed to have left by the time Jean got to the stage area. Someone else was packing up his drum kit. She wanted to ask about him but didn’t want to talk to any of the bandmates. She didn’t know what Leon might have said about her – not the truth, surely – to have explained her abrupt expulsion from his life. She picked up her boyfriend from the medical tent and they left the park.
    
    That was Sunday. The following Thursday, her no longer very emotionally abusive father asked her to go to the hardware store to pick up an orbital sander so he could refinish their back deck. Normally he would have hired someone to do this for him but he was currently in a form of therapy that encouraged physical activity and home improvement projects as means of developing self-control, learning to find satisfaction in small things, and channeling one’s energies into healthy interests rather than getting trapped in the cycle of repression, explosion, and remorse. Jean’s father said he was going to leave work promptly at five. If she could pick up the orbital sander on her way home from school, which got out at three, he would have a few good hours of daylight left to put into the deck. Jean, who wanted to encourage these healthy interests and development of self-control, agreed to run the errand. At the hardware store, she saw Leon. He was wearing an orange uniform smock and working in the paint section, running the machine that mixed the custom colors.
    
    She stuck the bright green box containing the orbital sander under her arm. She waited until he was without customers and then strode boldly up to him. ‘I heard your song,’ she said, trying to sound brazen, perhaps affronted, though she wasn’t.
    
    ‘What?’ he said. And then, ‘Not here.’
    
    He said he was about to go on break. She went to the front of the store and purchased the orbital sander while he clocked out. They reconvened a few minutes later in her parked car. He insisted that he had not written a song about her. She sang the chorus for him and he laughed like he had during their last happy moment together, when he had thought she was about to tell him that she was secretly thirty years old.
    
    ‘Okay,’ he said, still laughing. ‘You caught me.’
    
    ‘I guess it was pretty messed up, what I did,’ she said. He patted her thigh reassuringly. The reflexive intimacy of the gesture was a shock to both of them. He quickly withdrew his hand.
    
    ‘If anyone should be apologizing,’ he said, and took a deep breath as though preparing to make a statement rehearsed in private countless times.
    
    ‘Oh no,’ she said, cutting him off. ‘I take it as a gesture of respect.’ She meant the negative portrayal of her in the song she thought that he had written.
    
    Leon had no idea what to say to that. His break was almost over. He was back with Norma now. They were doing the one day at a time thing – hanging in, not hanging out – and even his kids’ mother said that the situation was better than in who knew how long. She was sometimes allowing sleepovers on nights that were technically hers.
    
    Leon telling Jean that he was back with Norma seemed to foreclose whatever line of conversation she’d been about to open. She herself could not have said for certain what line it would have been. Unlike Leon, she had rehearsed nothing, had not imagined a single thing about this moment beyond the fact that it might, at some point, occur. She was enamored of the mystery of her own heart, the inherent outlawry of desire itself, which she and Leon had translated into an actual if inadvertent crime, a crime with which they’d gotten away. Jean was looking forward to breaking up with her boyfriend, who had been cheating on her with Charlene Stevens, who would, in the weeks following 9/11, abruptly become an evangelical Christian and call Jean, who was away at college at Reed because she’d been offered a scholarship there and liked being close to the Cowlitz Nation, and Charlene would confess her high school sins to Jean and Jean would tell her that she’d known about it at the time and it didn’t matter, not then except as a pretext for a breakup and not now in any way, shape, or form. If Charlene were really looking for something to apologize for, Jean would say, why not that time at the alligator mall when she turned all the other girls against her over chicken on a toothpick? That moment, Jean would say, was the loneliest she had ever felt, or expected to feel, in her entire life. It had changed a lot of things for her in ways that were difficult to explain. There would be a long silence on the phone and then Charlene would say, ‘My word, Jean, grow up, there’s a war on,’ and hang up without saying God bless you or goodbye.
    
    In this moment, all that was still to come. So much was to come! Jean was looking forward to all of it. She would go home and hand the orbital sander to her father, and hear the whir and whup of it from her bedroom window, which she would have already opened to receive the cool evening air. Then there was the whole rest of life to look forward to, all that future history. Her heart was full of love for the life she would live, and when she was the age that Leon was now, and firing her therapist, she would think back to this long-ago time and recognize that she had been right. She would say to the therapist, ‘All anyone wants is to love their life and I have loved mine.’ After saying this she would slam his office door behind her, rattling the frame of an expressionist female nude whose presence in the waiting room had always irked her.
    
    In the meantime, Jean gave Leon a chaste kiss on the cheek and released him back into his workday. She pulled out of the hardware store parking lot, still humming to herself the brutal and beautiful song she still believed and would always believe that he had written. It was the most generous thing anyone had ever done for her – borne witness to her full true self – and she did not mind that there wasn’t another living soul who she could tell."

    "text": "The first mother Avni brings home is too clean. She wears white at all times, perpetually a mourner, and roams the two-bed flat with a feather duster tied to her slim wrist. ‘Don’t I look just like Aishwarya Rai?’ she asks, and pours bleach into the bathtub and onto her body. Scrub-a-dub-dub. Avni asks her no questions and takes her straight back.

    At the shelter, they lead her to the back and shoot her. ‘She’s had multiple placements,’ they explain. ‘Sometimes, this is the humane option.’
    
    The second mother is mean, and very, very beautiful. This one actually does look like Aishwarya Rai, Avni thinks. A star. She buys a weighing scale and makes Avni stand on it and watch the numbers wobble.
    
    ‘Too high!’ she decides when they steady.
    
    ‘Let’s play a game,’ Avni says, stepping off the scale. She crosses her arms over her body and watches as she shrinks in the mirror. ‘Would you rather have a fat, happy daughter, or a daughter who is thin and sad?’
    
    The second mother doesn’t hesitate: ‘Thin.’
    
    ‘And sad.’
    
    ‘Yes,’ she agrees.
    
    Avni nods. ‘How do you sleep?’
    
    ‘Too well,’ she confesses. ‘Like a baby.’
    
    The shelter people take her back, no problem. She has a highly desirable look, they say, and will find another home quickly. And does Avni want to take another look around?
    
    Avni does.
    
    The third mother is sad. All she talks about is the village she came from, where she’d had cows and babies who all died one by one. She’d longed for a living child her whole life, she says, but Avni has never been to a village, nor once felt the urge to milk cows.
    
    ‘Did you love your husband?’ she says, and when the third mother nods, asks why.
    
    ‘My choices were to love him or not,’ she says. ‘And loving him seemed easier.’
    
    ‘That’s a good answer,’ says Avni, and decides to keep her, at least for a while.
    
    They learn each other slowly. Third Mother wakes each day to make kadak chai and drink it on the two by two foot balcony with a wrought iron railing that Avni never uses except to dry her underwear. Third Mother drinks several cups of chai a day. Third Mother cooks in the late afternoons for dinner and next day’s lunch. Third Mother packs tiffins and sends them to Avni’s office with the neighbourhood dabbawala. Third Mother puts too much salt in her food, but Avni’s tastebuds adjust. Avni starts to crave salt. Avni likes having a hot lunch every day. Avni likes having a hot dinner. Avni likes that Third Mother snores because she can hear it through their shared wall. Avni has panic attacks when she tries to sleep. Avni gets cold all over and her legs twitch like the limbs of a dying insect. Avni feels frightened and lonely and frequently lightheaded. Avni needs company in the night-time but Avni doesn’t like men.
    
    ‘How old are you?’ Third Mother asks one week into living together. She’s opened the small kitchen window for ventilation while she fries bhindi in hot mustard oil. Through the metal bars, Avni can see the alley, and past it, into the balconies of the building next door. In the early mornings they are parrot perches, and in the afternoons, drying racks. In the nights, smoke spots for fathers, sons, rebel daughters.
    
    ‘Twenty-three,’ Avni replies. ‘You?’
    
    ‘Thirty-seven,’ she says. The bhindi crackles.
    
    ‘You look much older,’ says Avni, surprised. ‘It must be all the grief.’
    
    Third Mother wears salwars on weekdays and sarees on weekends and tries on short dresses from Avni’s cupboard when Avni isn’t home. She marks her parting with sindoor and has long, butt-length hair that Avni pulls from between her teeth at mealtimes and out the shower drain each week. Her eyes are deeply lined.
    
    Avni panics on a Saturday night and doesn’t know why. Her arms and legs spasm, stop being hers. She clenches her muscles for ten seconds, breathes in, breathes out. She wants to call her mother but they haven’t talked in nearly six months. She folds her knees under herself and leans forward in child’s pose. She lets her belly hang between her thighs. She tries to rest her forehead on the floor but fails. She times her breaths to Third Mother’s snores and makes it through the night.
    
    ‘How did you sleep,’ Third Mother asks the next morning, and Avni lies.
    
    ‘Fine.’
    
    Third Mother hums but doesn’t push.
    
    Avni had thought that she liked that about her. She doesn’t say anything. She says, ‘Do you need anything washed?’
    
    Third Mother brings her a basket full of clothes and cotton panties with lace trims.
    
    Avni’s bedsheets are soaked in sweat. She strips them and throws everything into the machine. She sits, watches soap bubbles form and froth and go round in circles. The day is a wash. Scrub-a-dub-dub.
    
    ‘Why did you choose me?’ Third Mother asks one day while Avni is making coffee.
    
    It has been nearly a month since Avni brought her home. The knobs for the stove stopped working years ago, so she turns the dials until she hears the click of the gas then holds a lighter to the burner until it catches flame.
    
    ‘You looked like all the mothers on TV,’ Avni says.
    
    All the mothers on TV look tired and sad and like they are singularly holding their families together.
    
    At work, Avni adds subtitles to ads for shampoo and Knorr instant soup mixes. Her desk is infested with roaches but the view is good. Sixteen floors high, the Arabian Sea a kilometre away. Aishwarya Rai tosses her gorgeous, bouncy hair over her shoulder and says, ‘Total Repair 5: Because we’re worth it.’ A little boy says, ‘Mom, do we eat or drink this?’ and his mom replies: ‘Knorr Soupy Noodles! Swallow how you like.’
    
    The noodles make Avni hungry. She sneaks away. Outside the front of the building, there’s a Starbucks and a Crêpe Suzette. To the back of the building, under big swathes of tarpaulin stitched together, a khao gully. She buys a vada pav for thirty rupees and asks for extra salt, extra chillies, extra bhajji. Her mother had never let her eat street food growing up. She breaks off small bits of the soft buttered bread and feeds them to the calico on the corner.
    
    Her job bores her. The cat accepts crumbs from her hand then sets to work with her rough tongue. Scrub-a-dub-dub. All detergent ads are the same. A child comes home from school dripping in mud. A mother says, ‘Ay-hay!’ But she isn’t angry. She knows she can fix this. Avni remembers this from her own childhood. Laundry’s an easy thing to fix. Her mother calls. She doesn’t pick up and she feels guilty about it. She doesn’t want to fight.
    
    They’d fought frequently when she was young: about Avni’s weight and her face and her body and her birth. They were very good at fighting – they always said things that were mean and true. Avni would say something mean and true, like, ‘You’re just a mother,’ and Mother would say something meaner and truer, like, ‘I was going to leave your father but I got pregnant with you.’ Then Avni would run away to the terrace and pretend that Aishwarya Rai was her real mother, that any minute she’d show up in a white stretch limousine and take her away.
    
    Avni strokes the cat’s white patches. The cat blinks at her, and she blinks back. She’d heard that slow-blinking is a way of saying ‘I love you’.
    
    When the cat wanders away she goes back upstairs. Dating apps. Wellness drinks. Travel agents. Paint. Bridal lehengas. Coffee. Gold. Food delivery. Dabbawala delivery. Third Mother sent mooli ke parathe and thecha. The parathe are soft and flaky. The thecha is sour and spicy and tingles all the inside walls of her mouth. Her co-workers buy food from the trolley like she used to, but she finds it bland now. Lacking salt. She cries on the bus home. There’s the salt. She licks her stinging lips and thinks of Mother.
    
    ‘Tell me about her,’ Third Mother says, when Avni explains why she’s been crying.
    
    ‘She was a size four her whole life,’ Avni says. ‘Except when she was pregnant with me, and then she was a size eight. She was a bad cook but a good baker. She never let me lick the spoon. Her Victoria Sponge was so soft you hardly had to chew. She didn’t love my father until she had me, and then she had two choices, and loving him was easier. She loved yoga and she could carry her whole body on the palms of her hands like a crow. She didn’t have any friends except me. I was her only friend. She thought Saif Ali Khan’s voice was sexy. And she sang to me most nights.’
    
    ‘She sounds nice,’ Third Mother says.
    
    They hug for the first time. Third Mother’s arms circle her shoulders loosely, cautiously. Avni finds it lacking.
    
    In the morning they brush their teeth side by side, spit-spit-gargle-spit. The Colgate is minty-fresh and the shower is freshly wet and the bathroom smells like mehndi. They drink chai on the balcony, then Avni drives Third Mother back to the shelter.
    
    In the car she whites and wilts and asks what she has done wrong. Avni notices newly the way her hair catches a copper tang under sunlight, like Aishwarya Rai in 2008. She doesn’t know what to say.
    
    The shelter people fuss over Third Mother and give each other knowing looks. ‘Perhaps,’ they suggest gently. ‘You might try an older mother? One with more training and experience?’
    
    The shelter houses one hundred and fifty women who used to be or long to be or have no choice but to be Mothers. They live in small double rooms with identical furniture. They cook together in a common kitchen and grow tulsi plants on the windowsill. On Sundays they sit in a long line that winds its way past the rooms and around all the living room furniture. They oil and braid each other’s hair. Avni did high school community service hours here. They seem happy enough to her.
    
    ‘All right,’ she decides. ‘I’ll give it a shot.’
    
    They bring out a tall, unsmiling woman with white hair pinned behind her ears.
    
    ‘Avni,’ they say. ‘This is Nazneen.’
    
    And so Nazneen becomes the fourth mother. She is significantly older than all the other mothers. Practically a grandmother. She is stern, but when Avni drives them home she rolls her window down and sticks her head out to feel the breeze. Then she laughs and laughs like a child.
    
    Nazneen makes different food than Third Mother had. Lots of meat, cheap cuts but perfectly cooked so they fall off the bone. She is from Hyderabad and she buys whole chickens straight from the butcher. She makes Avni learn how to clean and cut.
    
    ‘It’s gross and sad,’ Avni says. ‘I don’t want to do it.’
    
    ‘If you want to eat you will cook,’ Nazneen replies, unfazed. ‘You have got yourself a mother, not a maid.’
    
    She places the chicken on a wooden chopping board. ‘See,’ she says, indicating where with her big knife. ‘If you can, always cut through the joints instead of the bones.’
    
    Avni watches as she makes clean lines across the body of the chicken until it is disassembled and what’s left looks less like bird and more like meat.
    
    ‘This knife is not sharp enough,’ Nazneen observes. ‘Got it?’
    
    Avni nods. Her mother calls and she hits ignore.
    
    Nazneen’s face softens. She cuts breast, thighs, drumsticks, wings into small, fairly even pieces. ‘This is called karahi cut,’ she says. ‘Your mother never taught you?’
    
    ‘No,’ Avni says. ‘She must have thought other things were more important.’ ‘Like what?’
    
    Avni shrugs. ‘I don’t know,’ she says, picking up a piece of raw chicken and squishing it between her fingers.
    
    Nazneen thwacks her hand with the hilt of the knife and she puts it back down. Nazneen says, ‘Tell me more.’
    
    ‘There’s nothing to tell,’ Avni says, pressing her damp, sticky fingers together. ‘My mother never really cared for food. And I think I was a disappointing child.’
    
    She was not a beautiful child. The last time she had spoken to her mother, she had been on her knees. They were doing yoga together in her mother’s spare room. Child’s pose. Avni couldn’t fold herself forward far enough for her forehead to touch the floor then, either. Her stomach got in the way. Mother had been genuinely sad. She had said, ‘You look nothing like me.’
    
    The chicken karahi has less salt than Avni is now used to, but it’s moist and delicate and she hardly has to chew. She swallows; Nazneen pretends not to see her tears. It goes down easy, and there’s the salt.
    
    They do dishes before bed. Avni scrubs, Nazneen rinses.
    
    Nazneen doesn’t snore, so Avni feels extra alone in the nights. She can’t sleep again. She paces the flat and tries to regulate her breathing. Over and over, she counts down. Five things she can see, four things she can feel, three things she can hear, two things she can smell, one thing she can taste. She watches people smoking from the kitchen window. She chews on ice; she throws away the weighing scale.
    
    ‘I heard you,’ Nazneen says in the morning. ‘Do you often sleep badly?’
    
    ‘Yes,’ Avni says, stirring instant coffee into her bubbling milk.
    
    ‘Does anything help?’
    
    Avni shakes her head. ‘Nothing you can do.’
    
    ‘Something for another mother, perhaps?’ Nazneen guesses.
    
    Avni takes her coffee to go.
    
    At work she gets to observe a shoot for the first time. She is tired and jittery and building a booth with thick black cloth in the lobby of an ugly high-rise near Atria Mall. She stands in for the model while the cameramen set up their lights. She moves as instructed to. She flinches at the flash. She closes her eyes when the lights get too bright.
    
    ‘You, move!’ someone yells.
    
    When Avni opens her eyes, there, two feet away, surrounded by hair and makeup ladies, dressed in all-white with strings of pearls wrapped around her swanny neck, wind machine blowing her hair dramatically back, is Aishwarya Rai.
    
    The shoot takes hours. Aishwarya turns this way and that, offers long, slow, catlike blinks to the cameras. She is selling ‘Volume Shocking Mascara’ and it is shocking how beautiful she is. Avni tries to lock eyes, tries to slow blink back at her.
    
    They break for lunch and someone brings around chutney-cheese sandwiches for the crew. Aishwarya sits on one of those high makeup chairs and feeds herself a Caesar salad. Avni watches. The pieces of romaine are too big. Oh no. They’re smudging her perfect makeup. Her personal assistant is putting on a pair of disposable gloves. Her personal assistant is ripping each romaine leaf into smaller bites, one by one by one.
    
    ‘Chai?’ someone says.
    
    Avni takes it without shifting her gaze. She drinks without shifting her gaze. She spills chai on her white shirt and says, ‘Shit!’
    
    Aishwarya hears; Aishwarya sees.
    
    Avni doesn’t know what to do now that they are actually holding eye contact. She slow-blinks. Aishwarya’s eyes narrow, but she does not blink back. From somewhere else in the room, the director claps his hands loudly and Aishwarya disappears under a fluster of people armed with cotton pads and makeup brushes and bobby pins.
    
    Avni dabs at her shirt but she only makes the stain worse.
    
    Her boss’s boss’s intern, a skinny man in skinny jeans and a ganji, comes up to her and says they don’t need her anymore. She can leave.
    
    ‘But what if I don’t want to leave yet,’ she protests, holding the shirt away from her body and squeezing. A few drops of chai fall to the floor.
    
    ‘Sorry,’ he shrugs. ‘Aishwarya Ma’am wants you gone.’
    
    ‘No,’ Avni says, letting the fabric go. It falls back onto her body, sticks wetly to her stomach. ‘Why?’
    
    The intern tugs at his own ganji uncomfortably. ‘She said you scared her?’ he says, like a question.
    
    In Avni’s head, an image reverses: a white stretch limousine pulls up outside a middle-class apartment building in Panvel, Aishwarya Rai inside. The passenger door opens, then closes. The limo speeds off. A young girl picks herself up off the ground and watches as it disappears.
    
    ‘Aishwarya,’ Avni says, while the intern tries to tug her away. ‘Aishwarya, I’m sorry!’
    
    From the middle of all the make-up artists and hairstylists, a long, pale arm extends outwards and rises up like a kind of deity. It offers a graceful red carpet wave. Goodbye.
    
    Avni drives home in a very regular sized Maruti Suzuki.
    
    When she arrives, Nazneen is at the dining table. She has found Avni’s old photo albums and is looking through them carefully.
    
    ‘Hey,’ Avni says, reaching for the book. ‘No.’
    
    She flips, unrepentant. ‘Is this your mother?’ she asks. ‘It must be. You look just like her.’
    
    Avni sucks in a breath. She sits down. ‘I don’t want to talk about her,’ she says.
    
    Nazneen closes the book. ‘I do,’ she says. ‘Do you want to tell me what’s wrong?’
    
    ‘Not really.’ Avni gets up and moves to the kitchen. Nazneen follows her in. She takes off her shirt and stands over the sink in her bra. The Vim is running out, she notices. She drips what’s left onto the top and turns on the geyser, then the tap. Scrub-a-dub-dub. When she bends over she feels her stomach curve and expand over the waistband of her pants.
    
    ‘Why don’t you call her back,’ Nazneen says.
    
    ‘I can’t let the stain set,’ she replies.
    
    Nazneen takes off her dupatta and drapes it over Avni’s shoulders. She says, ‘I would like you to take me back to the shelter.’
    
    ‘What,’ Avni says, dropping the shirt. ‘Why?’
    
    ‘You should be using Surf for this. Never mind.’ Nazneen takes over. She switches off the geyser and turns the tap to the coldest temperature. She soaks the stain. A few minutes pass. She says, ‘I don’t think I am the right mother for you, Avni.’
    
    Avni laughs. ‘What a shit day this is,’ she says. She pulls the dupatta over her body and covers herself.
    
    ‘I am sorry to upset you,’ Nazneen says, switching off the tap and wringing the shirt with all the ferocity of a TurboDry until the excess water has sweated out. ‘But I don’t think you will find what you are looking for in a new mother.’
    
    Avni says, ‘Let me put on a shirt.’
    
    The shelter people are tired of her, Avni can tell. What is wrong this time, they ask, and why has she returned, and does she understand adoption is a serious lifetime commitment?
    
    Avni says she is very sorry for troubling them and lets Nazneen go.
    
    Nazneen doesn’t try to hug her. She takes her hand and holds it just long enough for Avni’s to feel warmed.
    
    ‘You must have been a good mother,’ Avni tells her.
    
    Nazneen smiles. ‘You say that because you are not my daughter.’
    
    In the house, Avni finds her white t-shirt drying on the balcony that has been unused since she took Third Mother back. It is spotless, as if the stain was never there. As if the chai had never spilled. Somehow she knows that she could have done exactly what Nazneen did and still made everything worse instead of better. Something-something mother’s touch.
    
    She goes to bed without eating and she can’t sleep. Her stomach feels like it is being wrung dry and her head is on a spin cycle, being vigorously washed. Scrub-a-dub-dub. She draws her legs up to her chest. She clenches her muscles, she breathes in, she unclenches her muscles, she breathes out. She picks up her phone and calls her mother back.
    
    ‘I didn’t call you to fight,’ she says as soon as Mother picks up.
    
    ‘I know why you called,’ Mother says. ‘I can always tell.’
    
    ‘Sorry,’ she says, and feels better already.
    
    ‘You can’t do like this,’ Mother tells her. ‘Calling me only when you need me.’
    
    Avni closes her eyes and decides to say something mean and true just one more time. ‘If I call you when I hurt,’ she says, ‘you make it better. If I call you when I’m not hurting, you make it worse.’
    
    Mother says, ‘Well,’ and blows her nose loudly.
    
    ‘Sorry,’ Avni repeats. The breath on the other end of the line tells her Mother is still there. She pictures her, in bed at this hour, in one of those thin cotton nighties she buys from Love Lady every spring. For better or worse, she knows Mother as well as Mother knows her.
    
    ‘Do you want to hear about my day?’ Mother asks finally. ‘Do you want me to sing for you?’
    
    ‘Yes,’ Avni says. Her head slows down. She uncurls her legs slowly and evens out her breathing. She stretches out so her whole body is flat against the mattress. ‘Please.’
    
    And Mother starts to speak, and Mother starts to sing."

    "text": "This fine creature falling into your lap when you were sixty-two and looked it and felt it was no hardship. Jean just needed to get the hang of things, that was all. Lily was an orphan in every regard – apart from the embarrassing fact there were two parents extant. To say they were not up to the job was to mock the notion of employment. Eleanor, the mother, a walking catastrophe – her self-murdering zeal matched only by a talent for staying alive. The wolf lived permanently at her door without quite reaching the upper chambers. The father – a complete nothing – to the extent one didn’t know his name.

    There was something about Lily going out into the world, a girl in a hoody with a basket in the forest, hem of her dress caught up in her fingertips, heart pried open so you could almost hear the pumping of her heroic (O positive!) blood type, urging her to receive life without judgement or grudges or speculation . . . Perhaps that was what was unbearable, the sense she would get mashed and pulped like all the other bright heroines, if Jean took her eye off her.
    
    She hadn’t had such worries with her own child. Louisa wasn’t vulnerable she was solid, thoughtless, flushed-cheeked, curly of hair. Like a small red car in an Enid Blyton she was self-reliant, forward-moving. She was lucky and had a tendency to land on her feet, whereas Lily stepped through rooms on tiptoe, peering behind her for ghosts. Powered by whirrings of bright moral energy, a ripe determination to emerge unscathed – those were strong things – but was it enough?
    
    The facts were sharp if not entirely clear. As luck would or wouldn’t have it, Lily had been brought up since late babyhood by Ruth, her grandmother. Seven weeks before her last breath Ruth asked Jean if she would take Lily on. They were not family but best friends of long-standing, colleagues at the coalface of the blackboard wiper, sober doler-outers of the detention baguette. Ruth’s voice struck an elaborately casual note, as one might ask, before a journey, if a neighbour could shake a hose at the sweet williams or put out and roll back the Wednesday bins. She spoke as though there was a possibility of a no, which there was not.
    
    ‘Sure,’ Jean said, matching Ruth in tone.
    
    ‘Sure? ’ the word was queried, found wanting, condemned.
    
    ‘It would be a great honour,’ Jean bowed.
    
    ‘Thank you.’
    
    She promised Ruth, at the end, she would not let anything bad happen. ‘Not on my watch,’ Jean said. ‘No! Never! No way!’ Who in their right mind dished out such pronouncements? Frank Sinatra? Lily would thrive and Eleanor would stay alive. Jean rubber-stamped it. Had they actually shaken hands? But Jean’s night self, which was less staunch than her day self, wanted some backup, some heavies, some sentinels. So here she was going to sleep singing ‘For Those in Peril on the Sea’. And sometimes ‘Those in Peril or at Sea’ to broaden its application.
    
     
    
    *
    
     
    
    ‘Idon’t want her to feel unentitled to mind things,’ Ruth was saying. She was propped up in the hospital bed, clipboard at the foot, clipboard at the head, as though the bed itself were conducting a thorough survey. Two winded pillows barely reached four inches thick. ‘Days not weeks,’ the doctor said, a certain shyness round the well-worn death sentence. Minding things was an entitlement, Jean pondered it. It was a step up from suffering; it was the belief your suffering was unjust. That you weren’t afraid to show you thought something of yourself. Very important. (Of course, some people made a blood sport out of minding everything – so dreary.)
    
    ‘That it wouldn’t destroy anyone if she thought now and then she had been dealt a cruel hand,’ Ruth spoke slowly but her diction was immaculate.
    
    ‘You have never been cruel.’
    
    ‘I know, but a start in life ought to be more solid.’
    
    ‘Yours wasn’t.’
    
    ‘Still. She may need at some point to allow herself to wail and flop a bit.’
    
    ‘These things can’t be forced.’
    
    ‘I don’t know. They can be accommodated.’
    
    Oh. So I’m to accommodate the unspeakable things because you did not? Jean moved the words round her mouth with stealth. Instead, ‘She will need buffers. Mechanisms to hand that will help. But of course she may be that rare soul with the kind of hardware to weather tough things. In which case that tendency, that infrastructure, should be respected.’
    
    ‘Christ, Jean! Buffers? Infrastructure? You hate resilience. You think it’s a racket. That it’s what’s expected from those who aren’t treated well. They’ll put it on your headstone!
    
    ‘OK. God! You’re impossible!’
    
    They both laughed.
    
    ‘Sorry,’ Ruth said.
    
    ‘No, I’m sorry,’ Jean said. ‘I suppose I want to tie things neatly in a bow.’
    
    ‘Well you can pack that in for a start.’
    
    ‘Understood.’
    
    ‘Isn’t it great we can still drive each other mad?’
    
    ‘I agree. I think it’s very authentic of us.’
    
    Then – ‘How will she grieve me?’ Ruth asked.
    
    What a question!
    
    ‘I wish I could slip away, so she wouldn’t notice. How could I wound her like this?’
    
    ‘It doesn’t work like that.’
    
    ‘I’ve let her down.’
    
    ‘I don’t see it that way.’
    
    ‘I do.’
    
     
    
    Later when Ruth woke, Jean steadied herself. She had a speech prepared and practised in the visitor’s chair. Trial and error, a good deal of editing, a passable dress rehearsal with moving lips. ‘I’ve a good plan,’ she said. ‘Would you like me to say what I think we would –’
    
    ‘Please.’
    
    ‘Well, we will miss and mourn you together. We’ll celebrate you as we do our teeth and drink our morning tea. You’ll top and tail our days.’
    
    ‘But how will you actually –?’
    
    It was evening now – a crescent moon, very still, in the corner of the window like a stamp. Ruth said it looked Parisian. One of the side lights in the ward was on the blink. It cast a queer throbbing intensity over the dangerous talk. A man in a blue boiler suit was up a ladder, fiddling away, quite merry.
    
    Jean reeled off her list like a little poem. It was as though she was scaling a tall glass building, but she tried for a restful atmosphere. ‘We’ll speak of you every day. We’ll continue some of your favourite routines and make the food you made and read the books you loved. We’ll walk through London parks, marvelling at all the different greens. We will cook now and then from Elizabeth David although, as you know, I’m not big on her superior tone. We’ll get out letters and photographs of you on Sunday afternoons, if there’s nothing decent on TV. We’ll come and visit you to say hello or when we have news, good or bad, and we’ll sit on the bench and fill you in on what’s going on at school and in the world. What’s on special at the supermarket! And we’ll bring coffee and viennoiserie sometimes to where you rest and just sit and chat there, showering you with croissant crumbs. We might sing, if you can stomach it, I know you’re not a fan of my country and western side. We may suggest we have read more than we have to impress you, so you can discount twenty-five per cent of our claims. If I say I’ve learned Russian to read Chekhov in the original you can take it with a pinch of salt. We’ll laugh and we’ll have a cry, I might bring the travel backgammon in case boredom sets in. We will have cream cheese and cucumber sandwiches and slot plain crisps inside for the crunch factor. That do you?’
    
    ‘Oh oh oh!’ Ruth murmured. There was pleasure there. Strong pleasure, weakly expressed. Jean stood and leaned over the bedside. She held out her hand and stroked Ruth’s hair. She thought suddenly of babies’ hair, the way when their hair first came in it didn’t always look real.
    
    ‘Oh yes, and I forgot, we’ll plant snowdrop bulbs beside you; I’ll order a load of them when I get home. They should be up nicely by mid-Jan. And we can put in something more scented and frothy for the spring, Lily can choose it, but I’ll steer her away from yellow, if I may. Soft blues and lilacs would be more my –
    
    ‘And I will answer any questions that she has about her life, and your life. I’ll do it carefully, laying things out little by little. And I’ll wait to be asked, like we said.’
    
    Jean exhaled and cast her eyes about the ward. It was one of the more difficult exams she had taken.
    
    Ruth was beginning to look uneasy. Had she under-delivered? Had she over-? There was something crass in giving all the details. It was always better to preserve your mystery. Were there omissions that grated? Had she hoped for more sorrow in the delivery? Did she require mention of black garments – on a child? Jean put her hand gently to her mouth to convey she didn’t blame it. She wasn’t going down that road.
    
    The sadness was spreading thickly between them now. Words couldn’t do anything, not really.
    
     
    
    After school, Lily arrived at the hospital. She often took refuge in the lavatories on the ward, disappearing for ten minutes or so, the days in need of breaking up and brokering. Her face damp and glistening on her return gave Jean the idea that she splashed herself for courage, taking time to think and feel the things necessary to her emotional privacy. But one couldn’t know. It might have been the remnants of tears, or steps taken to hide or dilute them. She came back refreshed-looking in any case. She was professional in that way, not in the sense of being controlled or businesslike, but in knowing what she needed. She was respected by the hospital staff who looked her up and down with great approval. They addressed their comments to her in the main – family had a higher status to friends in a hospital setting – but she was only fifteen. There was a lozenge-shaped pink patch of dry skin under Lily’s chin, and she rubbed away at it without seeming to notice. It expressed a form of physical sympathy with Ruth’s state, Jean thought. A dab of Vaseline ought to do the trick. Perhaps when they got home she ought to – no, it would be better coming in the morning.
    
    The doctor made his evening rounds, the tall, grand English one. His august look held both glamour and humility. ‘More like three or four days, now, I’m afraid.’ Then: ‘Less than a week, certainly.’ He lingered for some sort of civilised response. Jean rose to her feet, but she could not speak.
    
    ‘OK then. Fair enough,’ Lily murmured, nodding, meeting the doctor with a cool thin smile. That was incredible. The way she took it upon herself to lead them all into this new phase. Such maturity and authority. And if Lily could accept it, it meant they all could/must follow suit. So now it was just about how to colour in those precious hours. Just!
    
     
    
    Little tableaux from the past bobbed about them all the time, marking the scene for future memory. When Lily was small, five or six, something difficult happened, Jean half remembered, to do with her mother, it always was, who had shown up in bad order, or more likely not shown up at all. There was some kind of ensuing episode or confrontation, and Ruth took it hard, which was unusual, and had to go to bed for a time. Jean was put in charge of taking Lily on an outing, but on being asked what she’d like, Lily thought she was being quizzed about a present, and had spoken, if it wasn’t too expensive, of a new nail varnish she fancied. The shade was called Sunflower Mist; the stockist the chemist next to the laundrette. With ceremony, not quite marching but almost, they went and bought it, took it to a bright cafe.
    
    They ordered hot chocolates, not too sweet as Lily liked it, and she did them both with concentration, as good as a nail bar, pushing back Jean’s cuticles with an orange stick she brought from home, massaging the nail beds with the edges of the napkin, applying the colour with the tiny brush in three even strokes. The yellow had a greenish tinge, more Van Gogh’s chair than his sunflowers, the shade of Jean’s-Ex-Alan’s fingertips before he gave up smoking, Jean remarked. Still, Lily was thrilled. The atmosphere between them deepened. It was a powerful connection to have matching nails. Jean asked her if she felt OK, what with her mother coming round in a bad way or not coming when she had said she would or whatever it was that had gone awry – ‘It’s got to be tough to take’ – and Lily said, quite sensibly, ‘It’s cheered me down, Jean.’
    
     
    
    Jean fell for her then. She reached for something outlandish such as, ‘From now on instead of Jean will you call me . . . Gigi?’ but it might have pissed Ruth off, the wanting and organising of a special name. It smacked of that dread phrase ‘Our little secret’. It was enough their nails were twinned. Still – tempting.
    
    Gigi though, Jean rolled her eyes now, looking at Lily on the other side of the bay. What on earth had she been thinking? Gigi, my arse.
    
    Jean watched Lily approach the nurses’ station, take the nurse in charge to one side asking if it wasn’t time for a syringe driver. The nurse said no, not yet. There wasn’t any discernible breakthrough pain, apparently. How on earth did Lily know about syringe drivers? Jean was amazed.
    
    ‘I don’t think we should wait until there’s breakthrough pain,’ Lily said. ‘That would be bad, if we left it that late. No. Can we revisit tomorrow when the doctor does his rounds?’
    
    Revisit! What a mild and elegant way of saying I don’t agree.
    
    The day before, while Ruth slept fitfully, Jean and Lily had a conversation about ‘life-savers’. ‘When someone doesn’t see things my way,’ Jean said, ‘I used to tell them to get lost but now I just say,’ she sweetened her voice to benign automaton setting, ‘ “Do you have any flexibility?” And although it’s less satisfying I seem to get better results.’
    
    ‘Like wiggle room,’ Lily said, her face creasing. ‘Or is it wriggle room? I’m never sure.’
    
    ‘It’s wiggle,’ Jean said. ‘Easy to remember because a wiggle is a small flexible movement whereas a wriggle . . . a wriggle room would be a room in which to twist and writhe!’
    
    ‘Sounds good!’
    
    ‘Another one is, “What would you do if you were me?”, which is meant to get the other person to walk in your shoes. Swap allegiances,’ Jean said. ‘Change their perspective, at least. So they say.’
    
    ‘I heard Ruth say it on the telephone once. I don’t know if it worked. It was when my – when Eleanor was in the prison that time.’
    
    ‘Oh yes,’ Jean said. She heard her breathing coarsen. ‘I remember how unusually warm it was, that autumn, sometimes even hot, until halfway through November . . .’
    
     
    
    ‘Did you know I was born here?’
    
    ‘Yes I did know.’
    
    ‘SO cool!’ Lily said. ‘I might pop down to the baby place. Revisit the scenes of my earliest youth!’
    
    ‘Yep!’ Jean said. ‘Amazing!’ She closed her eyes. She’d heard of scenes she couldn’t stop herself animating – an infant trailing wires in a see-through box, skin crawling with sores and rashes, trembling unfocused limbs, despair. A babyscape ought to be soft and sweet but here there were only sharp-edged things. It was faintly pornographic in its crisis and craving. Failure and insufficiencies as far as the eye could see. It provoked in Jean a moral vertigo. She closed her eyes more tightly. It’s all right, she reassured. You’re beginning the grief I expect, that’s all. It’s starting.
    
    ‘What?’ Lily said. ‘What? Why have you gone all weird?’
    
    ‘I was . . . I was just thinking how the time flies, how it has flown, from that day to this. Incredible. All in the blink of an eye in the same building. One minute you’re down on the second floor and . . .’
    
    ‘OK?’ Lily said, grinning warily. ‘What have you done with Jean?’
    
    ‘What do you –’
    
    ‘Aren’t you the person I once heard say to the whole school in assembly, “Teenagers, they grow up so slow”?’
    
    ‘Well,’ Jean said. ‘I suppose I may have done. All right. All right. Got a laugh though, didn’t I?’
    
     
    
    The next day Ruth lay like a mound of ashes. Her mouth was a separate species though, the lips a good firm red, apart from some white marks that flecked the borders. She was not going to go quietly, that was certain. Odd when she’d never been exactly chatty before. Perhaps that was why it was necessary – shop now while stocks last. Unless the need for privacy was dying too . . . privacy had always been her dominion. Jean admired her for that. Her high, dry style – the things she bit down on habitually.
    
    ‘You won’t outdo me will you Jean?’
    
    ‘Well I’m going to outlive you, unless you’ve got a gun.’
    
    ‘No, I mean you won’t be so much better than me that you make me look awful.’
    
    ‘Of course I won’t. Wait – what?’
    
    ‘Can you mess up a bit, not do everything perfectly?’
    
    ‘These things happen naturally in households staffed by human people.’
    
    ‘It’s just your standards are higher than mine and you’re calmer and you’ve got money. And you’re cuddly and cosier too. You have a pink sofa and sweet things in pretty boxes in a cupboard.’
    
    ‘Everyone’s more cuddly than a cancer patient.’
    
    ‘Oh.’
    
    Then after a minute: ‘I mean, you’re being crazy. People idolise the dead! You’re not thinking straight.’
    
    ‘I don’t know.’
    
    ‘I’m not sure I can sign up to this. I know you want me to do my best for Lily. You said to knock myself out in every way. Think of the lists of instructions we drew up together. Twelve pages, single-spaced, both sides of the paper. Times New Roman! I am going to give it everything I’ve got – that’s the plan. Also, let us not forget, you don’t have any choice! There isn’t anybody else.’
    
    Ruth’s skin had altered subtly in tone and texture this last half-hour. Her arms had gone the colour of cement.
    
    ‘You’re just, you’re just feeling sorry for yourself!’
    
    ‘I am on my deathbed Jean.’
    
    ‘You don’t want me to fuck it up to make you look better. Not really. That’s not your style. Come on.’ Jean’s voice descended into its Tippex is the Devil timbre.
    
    ‘I’m so jealous. All the things I’m going to miss.’
    
    ‘Well – yes. I know.’
    
    ‘How can I compete?’
    
    ‘Well – but you’ve already given Lily the earth.’
    
    ‘It makes me think all sorts of terrible things about you.’
    
    ‘That’s all right. It’s normal. I can take it.’
    
    ‘It’s not very nice though.’
    
    ‘You’re going to need to die soon if you keep this up,’ Jean said.
    
    Ruth almost giggled but her face was watery against the parchment skin.
    
    ‘You know I think what I’m going to take from this little talk is that when I do err as I inevitably will, I’ll imagine you punching the air with the angels.’
    
    ‘I’m not much of an air puncher, though, am I? Could you imagine me clapping with them and their golden harps all in a row?’
    
    ‘Yes, I will, that’s much better. And I shall bow and feel the warmth of your approval beating down on my skin. That sound all right?’
    
    Ruth nodded painfully. There were vivid waves of pride and waves of shame. It had always been her currency, Jean thought. She pictured a passport with dual nationality.
    
     
    
    ‘There’s a girl in year seven at school,’ Jean began, ‘told me every night her big sister says to her, last thing, after they’ve done their teeth, “Night Sophie. Hope you die in your sleep.”’
    
    ‘Oh?’
    
    ‘Isn’t that . . . severe?’
    
    ‘Maybe she means I hope you die in your sleep when you’re an old lady, peacefully and not in pain or in a car accident or at the hands of some axe murderer. I hope you have a good death. It’s sweet.’
    
    ‘You think? She’s twelve years old.’
    
    ‘Well yes, I think so. Why not?’
    
    ‘Whatever you’re on can I have some?’
    
    Ruth pointed at two brown bottles on her nightstand. ‘Fill your boots.’
    
    ‘They just leave them lying about? I thought it was all under lock and key.’
    
    ‘Not really,’ Ruth said. ‘I’m not sure. The nurse does usually . . . there’s different stuff for different things. They bring round little paper cups.’
    
    ‘I see!’ Jean picked up the bottles and tried to read them but the writing was impossible.
    
    ‘Maybe I will try one,’ Jean said. ‘I need something. What’s that one there?’
    
    ‘A strong one, I think. Tramadol, or is it the other –? There’s the pale blue ones. Lovely colour. What’s that play where the man says “That’s a lovely shade of blue on your woolly”?’
    
    ‘Not sure. Is it Pinter maybe or more like Joe Orton? Whoever it was makes shade sound filthy!’
    
    ‘I know! And Gabapentin is the yellow ones with the numbers. Quite strong. I like that one. We could take it together, bit like holy communion?’
    
    ‘Ha! What time you due your next? We mustn’t be silly about it.’
    
    ‘I just wait until the nurse comes usually. It’s my favourite one today, Irene. She’s got four sisters in Jamaica but she is the cleverest and the most beautiful.’
    
    ‘Even so, she’s unlikely to hand out freebies to visitors. Or is there happy hour on Fridays?’
    
    ‘Is it Friday? That was quick. Thank God it’s Friday Jean!’
    
    ‘Maybe,’ Jean said. Then, ‘No I mustn’t, it’s irresponsible. What am I thinking?’
    
    ‘We are in a hospital.’
    
    ‘Yes, but we’re not in the business of creating more patients. The nurses don’t need extra dramas.’
    
    ‘But I never ring my bell or anything. Wouldn’t dream of it. Even if I was –’
    
    ‘I know. I know you wouldn’t . . . I, on the other hand . . .’
    
    ‘Yes, yes you would. Night and day.’
    
    The song ‘Night and Day’ hovered in the air between them, but neither had the heart to take the bait.
    
    Jean unscrewed the nearest brown bottle and lifted a yellow pill to her mouth. She imagined Ruth’s daughter Eleanor swinging onto the ward, putting on a bright brave blank face for her mother, although they all knew there was no saving things, not now. All the damage imprinted on Ruth’s flesh. Broken tissue scarred and inflamed. And that very odd thing indeed of no one ever judging her. Did they try hard not to, did it just come naturally?
    
     
    
    At home in the private solace of her sofa, Jean judged Eleanor mercilessly. She permitted herself little fetishised stints. They hit her system with force, like whipped cream folded into melted chocolate. She admired the judgements that she fashioned, the severity of their tone and tilt; above all their certainty. The wry internal musings of the critic. The sharp observations in the vocative case. What you put your mother through! The breathtaking cruelty of your leisure activities. Wrecking lives with no awareness or compunction. To dedicate your life to torturing others – what venomous career counselling did you attend? And forcing everyone to feel sorry for you in the process. Pitiful girl.
    
    Eleanor ruled through fear, left her mother and daughter routinely stunned and quaking. Afraid to answer the telephone. Afraid to take breaths. The amount of daily courage she exacted from them was an obscenity. Lily wearing yellow to prove she wasn’t crushed, dotting her i’s with hearts to convey optimism. What a strain to perform I’m all right with your every move, hopes pared back beyond what was decent, unable or unwilling to take the measure of the pain.
    
    Eleanor brought Ruth to her knees, kept her there, liked her there. And for what? To what aim? Jean flexed her strict beliefs before her like the founder of a cult. That Ruth also depended on opiates now was a parody of homecoming. Of leave-taking. What ugly parallels. Scoring in the morning, scoring in the evening. Jean shook her head with great bitterness. Still Ruth preferred parody to satire, she had said so more than once. Parody was playful. Less mean-spirited.
    
     
    
    Jean’s skin grew hot. It reddened with injustice. She held the pill from the nightstand against her lips in the spirit of can’t beat ’em join ’em. She saw three witches, in her imagination, ancient, cobwebbed and with red-rimmed eyes, but it was just Ruth, Eleanor and Jean when you looked closely – all lolling on the hospital bed singing songs and nodding out. Broomsticks ahoy! Night and Day. Death and Life. They would all go down or all go up together.
    
    The reality was, there was not a single spell left to be cast. A terrible Brecht poem called ‘I am Dirt’ sprang at Jean from God knows where. ‘Unfortunately, I had to do lots of things / That were harmful, purely to stay alive.’ The speaker took so many drugs she called herself a ‘bedsheet with no bones’. Sheets never have or have had bones, Jean was doubtful – but still the phrase had great power. It was how Eleanor was.
    
     
    
    The way Jean’s thoughts were going it was as though she was dying. She was too close to things. That was it. All of life was contagious. Of course your head would get muddled with the other person’s at the end. It was just the practical side of ‘for better or for worse’. That was friendship so much more than marriage. No one had a husband from seven to ninety but with women’s love it wasn’t even especially unusual. It would just merit an ‘Oh’ of recognition from another. No one would faint or anything.
    
    Lily arrived and sat with Ruth while Jean palmed the pill and made a raid on the vending machine. A four-finger KitKat detached from its coil and fell with a clunk to the grey trough at the base. Suddenly Jean lifted her hand and banged the glass front with her fist as though it had cheated her. Something was cheating her. Everything was. She didn’t stop beating until the whole machine rattled and began to emit a disastrous echoey wail. She nipped back to the ward in disgrace then, sitting on the blue vinyl chair at the edge of things, giving Ruth and Lily some privacy. She could see they were plotting something.
    
    I’ll get my mum here, leave it to me, no problem.
    
    God. Please not that.
    
    Lily came over to kiss them both goodbye. She was going to a friend’s for a sleepover. It was a good idea and Jean encouraged it. They must pace themselves. She could hold the fort. ‘I’ll ring you at Beth’s if I –’
    
    ‘Sure.’
    
    Jean gazed at Ruth in her parlous state. Perhaps Eleanor would come but in what condition? People being absent was more acutely felt by a certain type of individual than people being there. The tendrils of un-love went deeper. A disposition for grief. The impact had been searing, unforgettable, beyond endurance. There was nothing equal to it.
    
    She blinked and took in the facts of the room. Easy does it. Well done. It was routine for her to congratulate herself. Her high opinion was important. She named all the white things she could see on the ward: pillow, sheet, clipboard paper, teacup and saucer, Ruth’s ghost-face beginning to shut down. Ruth was peaceful in her slumbers. Concentrate, Jean told herself.
    
    She sat herself up, stiff in the visitor’s chair, the yellow pill still in her fingers. Sensible and calm now, she weighed things carefully. The truth was she could do with a lift, a break from all the pressure. Lily was off for the night, leaving Jean free to retire from the human race briefly. Saturday tomorrow – no school – excellent. It wasn’t an insane idea. The pill might help her sleep, which would be good. Sleep had become a complete stranger to her nights. She was feeling the strain now, all the time, no denying. Work hospital, work hospital, marking at the bedside, watching over Lily, helping Ruth get to the one thing she didn’t want. Fuck! This hinterland was stretching out for weeks and weeks. Aspects of her personality were becoming inoperable. She needed something. She popped the pill in her mouth – why not? And the way Ruth opened her eyes and shimmered with delight!
    
    ‘Oh no Jean stop! I’m so stupid. Christ! That’s Dulcolax.’
    
    Jean yanked it out with the tip of her little finger, scarlet nail nicking the fleshiest part of her gum. The pill was intact and still dry. ‘Ah, that I don’t need,’ she said.
    
    ‘Sorry about that.’
    
    ‘Never mind. No harm done. I wasn’t thinking.’
    
    ‘No you weren’t, I am a bit shocked.’
    
    ‘Good!’
    
     
    
    ‘You ever taken drugs much Jean?’
    
    ‘Well,’ she said. ‘I have and I haven’t. I had a very bad time with Dexedrine when I was young. Put me off for life. It was dreadful. I went mad for six weeks, but when you go mad you assume it’s forever. It was a shocking time.’
    
    ‘Why d’you take it?’
    
    ‘This,’ she said, grabbing a handful of belly.
    
    ‘Did you go very thin?’
    
    ‘It’s hard to know when you’re insane. They had to take me away in a van. It wasn’t pretty.’
    
    ‘Christ.’
    
    ‘Same thing happened to Muriel Spark! That was some consolation anyway. She wanted to get all slinky one Christmas, save money on her food bills – Dexedrine seemed the perfect answer. But one unexpected side effect – she got completely obsessed with T.S. Eliot! His most Christian play The Confidential Clerk – she thought it held special messages for her, beaming directly from T.S. himself. Then she started to believe he was communicating with her through the Times crossword.’
    
    ‘The Confidential Clerk? The crossword? Jean you’re making this up.’
    
    ‘No. It’s all there in black and white. All her hallucinations starred Eliot. Isn’t that just so chic? Then she convinced herself he’d taken a job as a window cleaner with some of her friends to get even closer. Rumour has it news reached him of her predicament and he wrote to her to say he wasn’t trying to reach her at all.’
    
    ‘Christ! Sending a message to say he wasn’t sending messages. Only a man!’
    
    ‘I know.’
    
    ‘Mine are mostly weddings and christenings.’
    
    ‘Well a hallucination ought to feature rites of passage I think. That sounds good and proper. I think it’s healthy.’ At her ‘healthy’, Jean winced. What the fuck is wrong with you?
    
    Snoozing happened to both of them then, Ruth’s head on the pillow, Jean’s nestled against the chair. It was very warm in the bay – Jean couldn’t help think free heating. And later, in the night, when the ward was lightless apart from a pale column of blue and almost dead apart from a pair of drowsy nurses, Jean woke and started whispering.
    
    ‘Hey! You knew all along about that pill! God I’m slow. You were teasing me. You beast!’
    
    Ruth stirred and rigged up a dim smile. Her eyes lit a little. Were there the dregs of mischief there?
    
    ‘Oh, I could kill you! You villain!’
    
    ‘Better get a move on then.’ Her voice was dry and sore and inhospitable.
    
    ‘Don’t . . .’
    
    And after a few minutes, ‘Jean?’
    
    ‘Yep?’
    
    ‘I do love you.’ Their fingers wove together hungry on the damp top sheet.
    
    ‘You’re not so bad yourself.’
    
     
    
    It was their last speaking.

    "text": "Originally I had planned to get to New York the normal way, fly there, but then Harris and I had gotten into an odd conversation with another couple at a party. Our friend Sonja said she loved to drive; she missed having the time to drive across the country. And Harris said, Well, that figures.

    What do you mean? we all said. Harris just shrugged, took a sip of his drink. He doesn’t talk much at parties. He hangs back, not needing anything from anyone, which of course draws people toward him. I’ve watched him move from room to room, running in slow motion from a crowd that is unconsciously chasing him.
    
    ‘Why does that figure?’ Sonja said, smiling. She wasn’t going to let this go. And maybe because it was her, so charming with her Auckland accent and big breasts, Harris suddenly laid out a fully formed theory.
    
    ‘Well, in life there are Parkers and there are Drivers,’ he began. ‘Drivers are able to maintain awareness and engagement even when life is boring. They don’t need applause for every little thing – they can get joy from petting a dog or hanging out with their kid and that’s enough. This kind of person can do cross‑country drives.’ He took a sip of his drink. Dogs were a hot‑button topic for us. Harris and Sam wanted one; I was ambivalent about pets in general. Are we totally sure about the domestication of animals? Will we not look back on this as a kind of slavery? But how to get out of it now when the world is so populated with dogs and cats that can’t fend for themselves? It’s not humane to just release them. It would have to be a group decision: No more pets after this. This is the last round of them. But that was never going to happen, even if everyone agreed with me, and literally no one did. Being anti‑pet (pro‑animal!) was one of my least winning qualities.
    
    ‘Parkers, on the other hand’ – and he looked at me – ‘need a discrete task that seems impossible, something that takes every bit of focus and for which they might receive applause. ‘Bravo,’ someone might say after they fit the car into an especially tight spot. ‘Amazing.’ The rest of the time they’re bored and fundamentally kind of . . .’ He looked at the ceiling, trying to think of the right word. ‘Disappointed. A Parker can’t drive across the country. But Parkers are good in emergencies,’ he added. ‘They like to save the day.’
    
    ‘I’m definitely a Parker,’ said Sonja’s husband. ‘I love to save the day.’
    
    ‘Wait, parking is exciting?’ said Sonja. ‘That seems counterintuitive. Wouldn’t driving –’
    
    ‘Think about it, hon, you have to get the angle just right –’
    
    ‘Okay, but are Drivers boring? I don’t want to be the boring, dependable kind of person.’
    
    ‘No, not at all,’ said Harris. ‘Drivers can have a good time more easily. That’s not boring.’
    
    ‘I want to be a Parker,’ Sonja said, pouting. ‘Too late,’ Harris said. ‘You can’t switch.’
    
    At this point I peeled away from the conversation. Message received. Harris and Sonja were grounded, easy going, people who liked to pet dogs and have sex whenever. And I was a Parker. What he called disappointed was really just depressed. I’d been a little blue recently, not a lot of fun around the house. Not like Sonja. I watched the two of them chatting – his barrel chest and graying black curls somehow looked boyish and his level of animation was totally unfamiliar to me, I guess she brought that out in him. It wasn’t jealousy exactly; being a third wheel is my native state. Sometimes Harris will seem to have rapport with a waitress or a cashier and I immediately cede to them as a couple – I internally step aside and give my place to the other woman, just for a few seconds, until the transaction is over.
    
    There was a small group of people dancing in the living room. I moved discreetly at first, getting my bearings, then the beat took hold and I let my vision blur. I fucked the air. All my limbs were in motion, making shapes that felt brand‑new. My skirt was tight, my top was sheer, my heels were high. The people around me were nodding and smiling; I couldn’t tell if they were embarrassed for me or actually impressed. The host’s father looked me up and down and winked – he was in his eighties. Was that how old a person had to be to think I was hot these days? I moved deeper into the crowd, shut my eyes, and slid side to side, shoulder first, like I was protecting stolen loot. Now I added a fist like a brawler, punching. I made figure eights with my ass at what felt like an incredible speed while holding my hands straight up in the air like I’d just made a goal. When I eventually opened my eyes I saw Harris across the room, watching. I could tell from his face that he thought I was being ‘unnecessarily provocative’. Or maybe I was projecting my parents onto him – that’s more something my mom would say – but he’s always leaned a bit traditional. On our second date I began revealing my peep show past the same way I always did, like a verbal striptease, until I noticed his face kind of shutting down. At which point I immediately began reversing the story, narratively putting my clothes back on, as it were, and minimizing the whole thing – a youthful misstep! Ancient history!
    
    Now he touched two fingers to his forehead and I did the same, relieved. We’d done this saluting thing the first time we ever laid eyes on each other and across many crowded rooms ever since. There you are. He didn’t look away. Dancers kept moving between us, but he held on for a moment longer, we both did. I smiled a little but this wasn’t really about happiness; it hit below fleeting feelings. At this slight remove all our formality falls away, revealing a mutual and steadfast devotion so tender I could have cried right there on the dance floor. Sure, he’s good‑looking, unflappable, insightful, but none of that would mean anything without this strange, almost pious, loyalty between us. Now we both knew to turn away. Other couples might have crossed the room toward each other and kissed, but we understood the feeling would disappear if we got too close. It’s some kind of Greek tragedy, us, but not all told.
    
    I wandered off the dance floor and into the master bathroom, washing my hands with the host’s facial cleanser. Of course it wasn’t too late to switch from Parker to Driver – anyone with a driver’s license could drive across the country. I could see myself pulling up in to the driveway with dusty tires, Sam running to greet me and Harris just standing in the doorway. He’d salute and I’d salute, but this time I’d walk into his arms, knowing I was finally home in a way I’d never been before.
    
    By morning the idea had taken hold. Why fly to New York when I could drive and finally become the sort of chill, grounded woman I’d always wanted to be? This could be the turning point of my life. If I lived to be ninety I was halfway through. Or if you thought of it as two lives, then I was at the very start of my second life. I imagined a vision quest – style journey involving a cave, a cliff, a crystal, maybe a labyrinth and a golden ring.
    
    ‘I’ve driven across the country,’ said Jordi. ‘It’s not that great.’
    
    ‘It’s not supposed to be! Is a silent meditation retreat “great”? Do people hike the Pacific Crest Trail because it’s “great”? And this is even higher stakes because if my mind wanders too far I’ll crash and die.’
    
    ‘Oh god, don’t say that.’
    
    ‘But my mind won’t wander! I’ll be totally present all the way there and all the way back. And for the rest of my life I’ll tell people about this cross‑country drive I did when I was forty‑five. That’s when I finally learned to just be myself.’
    
    Of course I was always myself with Jordi; she knew I meant be myself at home. All the time.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Harris had found an old foldout map of the United States and was tracing his finger across it. ‘If you take the southern route you can go through New Mexico and spend the night in Las Cruces.’ I was holding a plastic hairbrush and trying to focus on all the red and blue squiggles, but my eyes bounced off them.
    
    ‘Couldn’t I just put New York City into my Google Maps?’
    
    ‘But there are different ways to go. Different routes.’
    
    He said I should take an extra week so the drive wouldn’t eat into my New York days.
    
    ‘Really? That’s more than two weeks without you guys.’ I had never been apart from Sam for that long. Each time they ran past us I tried to hand them the hairbrush; surely at seven one could be the steward of one’s own tangly hair.
    
    ‘Well, you don’t want to drive for a week and then just turn around and come home. You should really take three weeks to make it worth your while.’
    
    ‘Three weeks? No, that would definitely be too long apart.’ He was being generous because I had done a lot of childcare recently while he worked with his twenty‑seven‑year‑old protégée, Caro. Is protégée the right word? Ingenue, whatever. He’s a record producer, which is actually ideal – there’s no competition between us but he knows what an artistic soul needs. Early on I called her Caroline; Caro felt too intimate, like a pet name.
    
    (‘Only the press calls her Caroline,’ Harris had said.)
    
    (‘That’s fine. I don’t mind being like the press.’)
    
    But it wasn’t just that he owed me childcare; Harris doesn’t have a lot of conflicted feelings vis‑à‑vis the domestic sphere. I didn’t either until we had a baby. Harris and I were just two workaholics, fairly equal. Without a child I could dance across the sexism of my era, whereas becoming a mother shoved my face right down into it. A latent bias, internalized by both of us, suddenly leapt forth in parenthood. It was now obvious that Harris was openly rewarded for each thing he did while I was quietly shamed for the same things. There was no way to fight back against this, no one to point a finger at, because it came from everywhere. Even walking around my own house I felt haunted, fluish with guilt about every single thing I did or didn’t do. Harris couldn’t see the haunting and this was the worst part: to be living with someone who fundamentally didn’t believe me and was really, really sick of having to pretend to empathize – or else be the bad guy! In his own home! How infuriating for him. And how infuriating to be the wife and not other women who could enjoy how terrific he was. How painful for both of us, especially given that we were modern, creative types used to living in our dreams of the future. But a baby exists only in the present, the historical, geographic, economic present. With a baby one could no longer be cute and coy about capitalism – money was time, time was everything. We could have skipped lightly across all this by not becoming parents; it never really had to come to a head. On the other hand, sometimes it’s good when things come to a head. And then eventually, one day: pop.
    
    Harris was using a highlighter directly on the map and telling me I could always decide later to stay a few extra days.
    
    ‘That’s the great thing about driving; you can play it by ear.’ He could be generous like this for the reasons I just explained. Not me! I always wanted him back right on the dot – extended trips, school holidays, a child being too sick to go to school, these things run a chill down the spines of working mothers whose freedom is so precarious to begin with. Still, I loved this about Harris, how he always encouraged me to stay longer and have fun. I reminded him I had to be back by the fifteenth anyway. Of course, he said; obviously.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Jordi and I were sipping milkshakes; mine strawberry, hers chocolate. Once a week we meet in her studio and eat junk together. Usually desserts we’d eaten as kids but almost never again since we’d discovered the healing power of whole grains and fermented foods and how sugar was basically heroin. This was part of a larger agreement to never become rigid, to maintain fluidity in diet and all things. At home I baked high‑protein, date‑sweetened treats. No one knew about our medicinal junk food, are you kidding? Harris and Sam would both be jealous, each in their own way. Similarly, I never told Harris what I jerked off to.
    
    ‘But maybe you guys could role‑play it?’ Jordi suggested. ‘Do you guys role‑play?’
    
    ‘Never.’
    
    ‘We don’t, either.’
    
    We decided then to tell each other exactly how a typical fuck played out in our marriages. We couldn’t believe we’d never done this before. If there was a good reason, neither of us could think of it.
    
    ‘Who initiates? You, right?’ I knew she was that sort of totally present, body‑rooted lover who felt like sex was a basic need.
    
    ‘Yes,’ she sighed, ‘it’s always me.’
    
    ‘I’m the initiator, too, actually, but only because I’m trying to get out ahead of the pressure.’
    
    ‘How often?’
    
    ‘Once a week.’
    
    ‘Wow,’ she moaned. ‘I wish I was having sex once a week!’ I laughed. We were so opposite.
    
    ‘I see it like exercise,’ I said. ‘You don’t ask yourself if you want to exercise, that’s the wrong question.’
    
    ‘You don’t exercise.’
    
    ‘I know, but if I did, I imagine it would be similar. I also don’t love getting in pools, by the way. Sunday nights! Packing for trips! Any transition. Whatever state I’m in I just want to stay in it, if that’s not too much to ask.’ It was, though, for a married person. Sometimes I could hear Harris’s dick whistling impatiently like a teakettle, at higher and higher pitches until I finally couldn’t take it and so I initiated.
    
    I went step by step, demonstrating some movements, saying who put what where, how many times I came, how it ended.
    
    ‘Geez,’ said Jordi. ‘So many positions.’
    
    ‘Yeah, that’s more his thing. I’m completely inside the movie in my head. It’s like I have a screen clamped in front of my face.’
    
    ‘What’s on the screen?’
    
    ‘Oh, you know, I’m a gross stepfather getting a blow job from my nineteen‑year‑old stepdaughter, or I’m the stepdaughter, getting tucked in. Or I’m flipping back and forth between them. There’s a lot of special tucking in involving boners.’
    
    ‘A stepfather and she’s over eighteen,’ Jordi laughed. ‘Very legal.’
    
    ‘It’s consensual! They’re mutually obsessed with each other; that’s a big part of it. You probably just think about Mel.’ ‘You don’t think about Harris?’
    
    ‘No, I do. Same dynamic, but with an intern or assistant. Usually I’m Harris being seduced by her. She’s reassuring me that my wife will never know and finally I just let her suck it.’
    
    ‘Geez, I feel so unimaginative,’ Jordi said. ‘I’m just like, ‘Body feel good. Me want.’’
    
    ‘You’re present – that’s much better! A body‑rooted fucker.’
    
    ‘Is there another kind?’
    
    ‘Mind‑rooted.’ I pointed my thumb at myself. ‘But I’m hoping to be more like you after my trip. Now you go.’
    
    ‘Oh, it’s so boring compared to you guys.’
    
    I was pleased she felt this way.
    
    ‘Just tell me.’
    
    She took a sip of her milkshake and pulled her mountain of black curls into the hair band she always wore around her wrist.
    
    ‘Sometimes it starts when we’re asleep, we just kind of start having sex without even knowing it. So we’re half‑awake and sort of sloppy and then it gets more heated and . . . oh god, it’s not . . . sexy‑sounding like you guys.’
    
    ‘Keep going,’ I said. I was starting to have a bad feeling.
    
    ‘Well, often we’re in a kind of ugly position, like with both our legs wrapped around each other, kind of in this tight ball, and I really like my mouth to be overfilled so almost her whole hand might be in my mouth so there’s drool running down the sides of my face and we’re just, you know, humping, kind of like animals. I’ve actually thought about how ugly this must look, like two desperate cavewomen. Usually we’re too asleep or lazy to go down on each other or use a dick so there’s just, like, a bunch of fingering, or not even that, just grinding. Sometimes I will literally just hump her butt until I come, without even fully waking up. Sometimes I fall asleep with my fingers in her cunt and when I wake up they’re all pruney.’
    
    I was quiet now, bludgeoned by this vision of intimacy. It wasn’t a matter of having lost at this conversation; I had lost at life.
    
    It was almost midnight. Moonlight and lamplight came through the window and her sculptures gleamed around us. They were Jordi’s own body but morphed, ghoulishly skewed toward animals, cars, monsters, always headless, in wood or limestone or plaster. We wouldn’t see each other again before my trip.
    
    ‘You know you can just fly if you want,’ she said. ‘Are you saying that because you think I’ll crash?’
    
    ‘No, no, not at all. Just that if you don’t transform . . . that’s fine, too.’
    
    I stared at her in the half‑light and she looked straight back at me.
    
    ‘I’m just making it harder for myself, aren’t I?’
    
    ‘Maybe.’
    
    I came into the house my usual way, like a thief. I turned the lock slowly and shut the door with the handle all the way to the left to avoid the click of the lock. Took off my shoes. Rolled my feet from heel to toe, which is how ninjas walk so silently. I was often two or three hours late because I had trouble admitting that I was planning to talk to Jordi for five hours. But how could it be any shorter, given that it was my one chance a week to be myself? My heart was pounding as I tiptoed through the living room. I know the quietest way to wash up, too: picking up and putting down the cup and face wash with this technique where you pretend each thing is heavier than it is. Imagine the cup is made of brick, so that as you put it down you’re also lifting it up, resisting its weight – the opposite of this would be just dropping it, letting gravity put it down. When I walk past Harris’s bedroom I think glide, glide, glide.
    
    When Harris comes in late he slams the door cheerfully behind him. He’s trying to be quiet, but not that hard. His mind is on other things, and why not? This is his house. Why behave like a thief? He doesn’t see how each moment can be made terrible if you only try. There can be a problem every second so that life is a sort of low‑grade torture. Then, when you are free, like when I was eating dessert with Jordi, it feels really, really good, like a drug high. So: grit, grit, grit, then: release. Joy. This works especially well for a life built around grueling self‑discipline culminating in glittery debuts and premieres. Grit, grit, grit, then: ta‑da! The thing that links the two states is fantasy. As a girl I fantasized about the perfect dollhouse, now I fantasize about the moment when I would finally reveal what I’d been making in the garage and be suddenly seen, understood, and adored – or at least get to stay in a nice hotel. These rewards really took the edge off life, carried me through the endless cleaning and cooking and caring and working. As a child I knew these weren’t just fantasies. One day I really would leave this house, these people, this city, and live a completely different life."

    "text": "When my eye fell out of its socket, I called for my mother.

    ‘Ma! Ma! What’s happening to me?’ I cried.
    
    She came running into the room from the kitchen, flustered, knife still in hand from chopping onions. ‘What’s wrong?’ she asked. She seemed annoyed that I had interrupted her flow of work. It took her a second to look down at the floor, where my eyeball lay. ‘Oh! Oh God forgive us!’
    
    Ma couldn’t bring herself to touch it; she picked up my eye using two spoons. We weren’t really sure what to do with the eyeball, so we plopped it in the bag of frozen peas she used to make pulao. The entire time I kept one hand over the hole in my face.
    
    We called my father, who was at work. Ma put him on speakerphone so I could explain what had happened.
    
    ‘My eye fell out!’ I said.
    
    My father came home immediately. Ma was in hysterics, pacing back and forth, phoning family and friends and friends of friends who might know what was happening to me.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    The day started off like any other. My father was the first to rise. As usual, he woke the rest of the household with his loud retching over the bathroom sink. Ma got up soon after, heading to the kitchen to heat up leftover daal and cook fresh roti for our breakfast. Sometimes, if I was especially hungry, I asked her for a fried egg. I didn’t that day.
    
    I remembered watching my father that morning as he flagged down a rickshaw and climbed onto it. Off he went to work. After he was gone, I played some songs on the harmonium. Ma was in a good mood and came in to watch me for a bit. She always said my singing calmed her, although I could think of a few instances throughout my life when the sound of my voice had driven her berserk.
    
    It was a few hours later, while I was preparing for the visit of a student, when the eye fell out.
    
    My father took us to the family doctor – a stocky, talkative man we had been visiting ever since I was twelve. I think he was related to my father through some long-winded connection. A cousin of a cousin, maybe. I couldn’t be sure. I watched the two men discuss my condition, occasionally dropping in some personal anecdote or news about the extended family, but otherwise they stayed mainly on course. Ma had brought along my eye in the pea bag, which was now dripping condensation on the floor.
    
    ‘I know exactly why this is happening!’ exclaimed the doctor. ‘You must take her to the marriage market!’
    
    All attention shifted to me.
    
    ‘The market?’ Ma replied, hand over her mouth. ‘But –’
    
    ‘You’re an expiring woman,’ said the doctor, pointing at me. ‘This happens to women of a certain age, you know, to the ones that put off getting married for work or school or whatever various reasons . . .’ He trailed off and looked at my father. ‘She’s in rot now. You’ll have to take her to the market before it’s too late.’
    
    ‘How much time do we have?’ my father replied.
    
    ‘How much time do you want?’ said the doctor. ‘Thirty-four years old! Not young anymore, eh? I don’t think there’s much time at all!’
    
    ‘And the eye?’ I asked. ‘Can you put it back?’
    
    ‘I am sorry,’ replied the doctor. ‘But no, I cannot.’
    
    The doctor gave me an eyepatch to wear and instructed me to keep the area clean. My father was quite silent in the taxi home. I asked Ma to let me sit on the left side of the car, so that I could look out the window through my one remaining eye.
    
    ‘Say something!’ my mother exclaimed. ‘Your daughter is falling apart!’
    
    My father grunted. ‘You heard what the doctor said. She is not young anymore. Perhaps we waited too long. We should have started looking a long time ago.’
    
    ‘We can start looking now.’
    
    ‘No, no one will take a one-eyed woman. We must go to the marriage market, like the doctor said.’
    
     
    
     
    
    That night Ma slept next to me, just in case something else happened. Restless, I kept turning towards her. In the glow of the air conditioner lights, I could see her rough outline, even with one eye. She was on her back and didn’t turn towards me.
    
    It was so cold that night. Somehow I was simultaneously shivering and sweating. Even with the wintertime duvet I felt a chill penetrating deep into my bones. Ma seemed to be awake too.
    
    ‘Ma, what will happen to me now?’
    
    She held my hand. ‘Don’t worry so much. Your father took the day off work tomorrow. In the morning, we will figure out what to do.’
    
    ‘Will you really take me to the market?’
    
    ‘I don’t know.’
    
    ‘Will I still be able to play the harmonium?’
    
    Ma sighed. ‘I don’t know.’
    
     
    
     
    
    When I woke in the morning, I peeled off my blanket to find that one of my legs had shrivelled up and turned black, detaching from the rest of my body just below the knee. Looking at it, I felt a strange mixture of disgust and wonder, the former because it was a ghastly sight overall, and the latter because I was amazed at my body’s capacity for self-destruction.
    
    I thought of the house geckos in our flat. Once, some twenty-odd years ago, Ma had thrown a book at one on the wall of our living room, cutting off its tail. Ha! I finally got it! she said, rejoicing in her victory. Three weeks later, I noticed the same gecko loitering on our flat walls once again, its stubby, regrowing tail sprouting from its tiny body. I wondered if my leg would come back that way.
    
    When my parents saw my dead, gangrenous leg, the severity of my situation must have dawned on them. My father skipped breakfast – unusual for him, as he was generally a hungry man – to schedule a house call from our family doctor. Ma phoned my grandmother, who arrived an hour later with freshly-made samosas.
    
    ‘Oh, you poor thing!’ said my grandmother, sitting next to me on the bed. ‘Look at the state of you!’
    
    ‘Hi, Nani. How are you?’
    
    ‘Oh, who will marry you now?’ she cried. She glared at my mother. ‘This is all your doing!’
    
    Ma looked down at her feet. I grabbed a samosa from the paper bag Nani had brought with her. It was my favourite kind: filled with ground beef and perfectly crispy on the outside.
    
    ‘Amma, we didn’t know –’
    
    ‘Don’t “Amma” me! I told you how this happened to my brother-in-law’s daughter! He waited too long, encouraged her to study and work instead of settling down –’
    
    ‘Amma, how was I –’
    
    ‘– and she rotted! Expired, just like your daughter will now! You modern women, with your modern ideals. Well, look at where it’s gotten you. A one-eyed, one-legged woman no one will marry!’
    
    I failed to see what was so modern about studying and working. The men in my life had been doing these things for decades, and many of them were very old-fashioned. I kept silent and chewed. I was very tired. Besides, despite being present, this entire conversation between mother and daughter seemed to be going on entirely in my absence. I felt I had very little to do with it.
    
    ‘She had dreams!’ Ma yelled. ‘She was an excellent harmonium player. Still is!’ She shook with emotion. ‘She’s good, she’s on TV, she’s on the radio, she makes a significant amount of money from her lessons. People are desperate to have her teach their kids, did you know that? All because I gave her that freedom, I put her in harmonium classes, I took her there every weekend! Not even her father helped . . .’
    
    My father entered then. ‘Amma, thank you for visiting,’ he said. ‘If you ladies are done arguing, the family doctor is on his way.’ His gaze shifted in my general direction. I noticed he couldn’t quite look me in the eye. ‘Tomorrow we are taking her to the market.’
    
    The family doctor was about an hour late. He always made us wait when we visited him at the hospital too, so this didn’t surprise me. He looked at me with an expression of pity that was simultaneously full of smugness, as though he very badly wanted to say I told you so but couldn’t. It would have been very cruel of him to do so. The doctor fitted me with a prosthetic, prescribed me some medicine and told my parents there could be no more delay. They had to take me to the marriage market immediately, or my rapid decay would result in death, probably within the next two days. Ma and Nani let out cries of pain and panic, while my father nodded stoically. I was just happy to be able to walk again, even if I did stumble here and there.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    The following morning (fortunately, no other body parts had fallen off), Ma and my father were to take me to the marriage market. There was a certain degree of preparation required beforehand. With the help of the prosthetic leg, I was able to take myself to the bathroom to bathe. I took off my eyepatch and ran lukewarm water over my face, washing off the grime of the past two days. Once I was clean, Ma dried and styled my hair, applied heavy makeup on my face and dressed me in her finest sari. My father bought a fresh eyepatch from the pharmacy for me to wear.
    
    The marriage market, as suggested by its name, was a gathering place where the city’s single women put themselves on display for eligible bachelors. It was located at a convention centre. Women were priced, then assigned booths on the large, sprawling floor, where men were floated freely around, conversing, and ultimately choosing their spouses. Marriages occurred on-site, and most of the men who went in alone came out with a wife of their choosing. Most people – whether that was a woman on display or a man casually browsing – were accompanied to the market by their families, who helped vet, barter, and choose the best mate for their children.
    
    I had heard stories of the marriage market from friends and family, but these tales had always carried an element of detachment. I would never have imagined that I would become one of the market’s offerings. I suppose I was somewhat naive, in a sense, thinking I had more time.
    
    After we arrived, my parents and I stood in line for a booth assignment. I looked around and observed – as well as I could with my one remaining eye – the hordes of women that had come to take part in this grand exchange. They were of all ages – fresh-faced, newly-adult women, middle-aged women, older women, and even the geriatric. I also noticed a few expiring women, just like me, wearing eyepatches or wigs to conceal balding heads, or using crutches.
    
    Once we were at the front of the line, the ticketing attendant took one look at me and asked, ‘Expiring?’
    
    ‘Yes,’ said my father. ‘But it is still early, and slow. She is a very good harmonium player. You might see her on the television sometimes.’
    
    ‘And age?’
    
    ‘Thirty-four. But looks younger, doesn’t she?’
    
    The attendant, a young boy, no older than somewhere in the mid-twenties, said, ‘She’ll need a discount sticker.’ He reached for a bright orange sticker on his desk and peeled it off its backing, stood up and reached over to stick it on my forehead.
    
    ‘What does it say?’ I asked my father.
    
    ‘Discounted.’
    
     
    
     
    
    We went in. I was sure my parents had determined a suitable price for me, but I didn’t care to find out how much that was. I felt my value was diminishing, anyways, with the discount sticker and my missing eye and leg. Not that they were exactly missing. I knew exactly where they were (the eye was still in the pea bag, now back in the freezer, and the leg – well, my father had simply thrown it in the rubbish bin).
    
    Ma set up the booth with photographs of me throughout the years. She also put out business cards. My father arranged a few pamphlets containing my biodata –information about my schooling, work experience, and musical achievements. I didn’t remember ever making one, so it must have been my parents’ own creation, a carefully-constructed document of my identity as it existed in their eyes. Ma positioned me at the front of the booth, shifting my limbs and adjusting my sari – the way a shopkeeper would a mannequin’s – to maximise my appeal to potential suitors.
    
    As I stood there, watching one man after another walk past my booth, take one look at my eyepatch and quickly scurry away, I thought about what my life might look like after the market. Would I still have the freedom to sing and play the harmonium, the way I did while living with my parents? I suspected life as I knew it would be over, that my craft would have to take a backseat as I became one half of a whole, a wife to a husband, a mother to a child that would take root in my broken body. Suddenly I was overcome with emotion, a profound sadness I hadn’t let myself experience until right then. Also my legs – especially the one with the prosthetic – hurt from standing so long, and it was very hot inside the convention centre. I wept.
    
    ‘Don’t cry!’ warned my father. ‘You’ll scare off the potential suitors.’
    
    Ma gently – and silently – wiped away my tears.
    
    The first man to speak to my parents was a doctor-in-training. He was thirty years old and had been married once before. He said his first wife had passed away from natural causes, though it was unclear what these causes were.
    
    ‘Oh, may her soul rest in peace. When did she pass away?’ asked Ma.
    
    ‘Last week,’ replied the man.
    
    The second man must have been older than my father. He certainly had more grey hairs than my father did. He looked at me briefly, read my biodata intently, and spent an oddly-long amount of time going over photographs of me as a teenager. He was a businessman and spent much of the year travelling.
    
    ‘What kind of business?’ asked my father.
    
    ‘Oh, you know the kind. Shipping and trading.’
    
    My father really did not know the kind.
    
    The third man was the only one to address me directly. I think he recognized me from my brief stints on television, which came about when a few channels asked me to perform on one of their nationally-broadcast music shows. I’d made good money like this, and used my earnings to buy my parents gifts, or finance road trips with friends.
    
    ‘Discounted, huh?’ asked the third man. ‘Ridiculous! Do they know what a star they have here?’
    
    My father seemed to melt at this comment. ‘That’s what I told them! She’s a musical genius.’
    
    ‘Half a star now,’ I replied.
    
    The third man looked at me. His gaze was intense and full of curiosity. ‘Time caught up to you?’ he asked.
    
    I shrugged. ‘I barely saw it coming.’
    
    ‘Yes, well, I suppose you wouldn’t, not with one eye.’
    
    I laughed then. Really laughed. I appreciated someone approaching my situation with humour, although it did all still feel hopeless overall. I looked closer at the third man. He had a nice face, and a smile that was slightly off-kilter, but endearing regardless. He had the look of someone who knew something you didn’t.
    
    The third man bought me that evening. The formalities were quick and uncomplicated. There was an uttering of words, a signing of papers, and a commitment to be with one another till death did us part. My parents hugged me goodbye as I prepared to go to my new home. By the end of the night, I felt generally optimistic about life with the third man. Or, as he was now, my husband.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    There was kindness in the beginning. I like to remember it that way.
    
    But marital life required some adjustment. I came to realise how much I had taken for granted throughout the years – having both eyes, legs, and the freedom that came with being an unmarried, childless woman. The truth was I was very comfortable at my parents’ home; it had never really occurred to me that said comfort was at the expense of Ma’s constant labour. More importantly, I had been very free. If, for instance, I wanted to see a friend for poori and tea in the middle of the day, I could. If I wished to watch a late-night artist showcase across the city, my father (albeit begrudgingly) would accompany me. I’d stay up till the early hours of the morning watching natoks on television or playing songs on my harmonium, and no one could tell me anything. I had a solid circle of friends whom I could count on for a good time. My life had belonged entirely to me; I had been a bird in an unlocked cage.
    
    Now that I was on the other side of things – a wife to a man – life became very different, and I felt like I was always running out of time.
    
    My husband was a university professor. I liked to think we had that in common, that we had both taken on educating roles in life. However, my husband taught mathematics, and as a result (or perhaps due to the fact that he was naturally drawn to mathematics), he was very formulaic in his thinking. Very exact. He wanted for us both to wake together, and for meals to be served at certain set times. He wanted the house spotless at all times, and demanded quiet when he needed to grade papers or take a nap after a long day of teaching. I failed to understand how he could live life by such rigid rules, but I soon learned that it wasn’t for me to understand at all.
    
    I say there was kindness because my husband gave me grace, even if it was only during the initial months when I was still getting accustomed to life as his wife. He taught me certain things, like how to cook his favourite foods, wash his clothes, and how to behave when he climbed on top of me at night. He even let me play my harmonium – which my parents had dropped off along with the rest of my things – whenever I wished. In fact, he enjoyed it when I did. It was one of the reasons he had married me. When I sang, my husband would shower me with praises, telling me I had the voice of an angel. Those early days were nice, in a sense, but I wouldn’t call what laid between us love. Something resembling it, sure.
    
    About half a year into our marriage, some of my students’ parents reached out to me about resuming my harmonium lessons. I ran the idea by my husband.
    
    ‘I deal with enough overgrown children at the university,’ he said. ‘I don’t need more in my house. Unless you want to have one of our own.’
    
    I ignored the suggestion. ‘I could go to them,’ I counter-offered. ‘That’s what I used to do back in the day.’
    
    ‘With your one leg?’ he retorted.
    
    I never mentioned the idea again. I couldn’t bear the thought of my students being around someone as unwelcoming as him. What he said was true. I was a half-woman, with my one leg and missing eye. But my husband had known both these things before he chose to buy me at the marriage market. What good did it do him to taunt me now? I began wondering why my husband had purchased a discounted woman like me in the first place. He was relatively young (a man’s thirty-five was very different to a woman’s thirty-five), good-looking, and he had a stable job. His family, when I met them, seemed polite and welcoming enough. Why didn’t he leave a half-woman like me to the half-men (who weren’t called half-men at all, but just men)? Sometimes I thought he liked that I was wounded – that having my shortcomings so prevalent made him feel better about his own.
    
    It was around the eight-month mark that I became a whole woman again. One morning I woke to find that my right eye was back, as good as new. I think the new eye had even better vision than the old one. My leg, too, grew back with haste, just like the gecko’s tail from my childhood flat. It was an odd feeling, to have a functioning eye and leg after spending so long without them. It felt like a rebirth. And a death of sorts too.
    
    My parents were overjoyed; they came over with sweets – rasgulla and sandesh, my favourites – to celebrate the occasion. ‘I knew it!’ boasted my father. ‘I knew your husband was a good match as soon as I saw him at the marriage market! Look at you, my daughter, whole again!’
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    My husband was kind, and then he was not. With men, it is always the same story.
    
    My harmonium, which my husband had encouraged me to play, save for when he needed to sleep, became of utmost annoyance to him. ‘Keep it down, I’m grading papers!’ he’d say, or a simple, ‘Be quiet!’ If he had doted on me at first, any semblance of fondness was gone by the time we reached one-and-a-half years of marriage. The change was gradual, but it did not go unnoticed. My husband became short-tempered. He began to spend more time at the university, often staying out late with friends or colleagues. I grew suspicious, but never jealous. In a way, I felt like this man, this stranger I had married to save myself from the clutches of my body’s expiration, had always only ever been a stranger. He had never belonged to me, nor I to him. I knew that he kept a part of himself stored away in a secret place, a place that was forever out of my reach.
    
    Once, in the dark, I asked my husband whether there was somebody else. I told him I wouldn’t be angry, and that I was only curious.
    
    ‘No,’ he said. There was just enough hesitation in his tone to let me know I wasn’t being paranoid. ‘You’re being paranoid.’
    
    ‘Am I?’
    
    ‘Yes, you women are always overthinking. Now sleep.’
    
     
    
     
    
    I imagined our marriage as an egg: flawless and smooth at first, until gradually, cracks began to appear. Who caused them, I didn’t know. I imagined the yolk of it – my husband’s secrets, my resentment towards him, our general unhappiness – oozing out of the cracks on the shell. A rotten egg, that’s what we were.
    
    Ma came over frequently, especially towards the end. I think she could sense that I was preparing for departure. During one of her visits I lay my head down on her lap. She ran a hand through my hair and hummed one of my favourite songs. My husband was at work.
    
    ‘Ma, I’m going to leave him.’
    
    Ma’s hand froze. ‘Leave?’
    
    ‘Yes.’
    
    ‘And go where?’
    
    ‘Back to you and my father,’ I said. ‘Won’t you have me?’
    
    ‘You’ll die,’ she said, voice quaking. ‘The rot will come back.’
    
    ‘I’ll take it, Ma.’ My face felt warm, then tears.
    
    ‘Oh, what would people say?’ cried my mother. ‘A woman of your age, if you separate from him . . . No.’ Her tone turned stern, the way it used to sound sometimes when I was a child, and refused to study. ‘This is just what marriage is,’ she went on. ‘It’s new to you, so you don’t know how it is –’
    
    ‘I don’t need to know how it is anymore.’
    
    ‘You became too used to your free-bird life, your adventurous ways . . . Always running around the city, spending time out with God-knows-who! Your father and I allowed some of it, I admit, letting you go to those concerts and make those television appearances, oh and the radio –’
    
    ‘That made me happy, Ma,’ I cried. ‘I was so happy then.’
    
    ‘When your father and I first married, I cried every night for a month. But slowly, I came to accept my situation. Soon, with time, you will do the same.’
    
    I had always thought my parents were a happy couple. It occurred to me that there was much that Ma never told me. ‘I don’t want to do the same!’ I howled. ‘I had a good life before him. I don’t see why anything had to change!’
    
    ‘You were fading away! You were becoming half a woman!’
    
    My tears streamed down and onto Ma’s sari. ‘I’d rather have death than this kind of life.’
    
    Ma kept silent. She no longer hummed. She resumed running her hand through my hair, which felt very comfortable. Except for when her fingers caught in the tangles.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    As it turned out I didn’t have to leave my husband at all. I was preparing dinner one evening, months after Ma’s visit, when he entered our home with a woman in tow. She was young. I would’ve guessed she was in her mid-twenties, at best.
    
    ‘Who is this?’ I asked him. ‘Hello,’ I said to her.
    
    ‘I’ve married again,’ said my husband. ‘I went to the marriage market and picked her up today.’
    
    ‘What?’
    
    I had a strange experience then. As I looked at my husband, then at his new wife, then back at my husband, I left my own body and entered the woman’s. I was watching this ridiculous scenario through her eyes. What must she have thought of me, in that moment, wearing my raggedy, fraying nightgown and brandishing the wooden spoon I was using to stir the pot of daal on the stove? More importantly, what did she see in him, this man that had disappointed me in so many ways, and (though she didn’t know it) would soon do the same to her? To her, I must have seemed like the only obstacle between her and the picturesque marital life of her dreams. An angry, scorned first wife.
    
    It was a tragic situation, but slightly comical.
    
    ‘It is time for you to leave,’ continued my husband. ‘I have brought divorce papers –’
    
    ‘All right,’ I said.
    
    ‘All right?’ he asked.
    
    I realised my husband expected some resistance here, that perhaps I had been assigned the role of desperate wife – which I had no idea how to play. The truth was I felt no desire to stay in this home with a man who had only ever used me to alleviate the loneliness of his life. Half or whole, I decided then that I would face whatever fate lay ahead of me, whether that was a slow demise through further limb loss, or a quick, painless death as I once again became an expiring woman.
    
    I signed the papers right there at my husband’s dining table, grateful to still have two working arms. I can’t say I felt much in the moment except for relief – a sense of weightlessness that I hadn’t experienced in many, many months. As I watched my (now ex) husband embrace his new, fresh-faced wife, I felt no anger or resentment. I only thought of what lay ahead of me.
    
    ‘You’ll die,’ said my ex-husband as I left. ‘You’ll die without me.’
    
     
    
    That night, back at my parents’ flat, the atmosphere was one of overwhelming happiness and monstrous tragedy. We did not know how much time I had left, or what I would lose next. There was little scientific evidence as to how fading-away worked, and most women cured it by marrying. Well, we had tried that. I played the harmonium late into the night, as much as I wished, filling up our flat with the sounds of my sa-re-ga-mas.
    
    Ma slept next to me, just like she did the night I lost my eye so many months ago, and like she often did when I was a child.
    
    ‘I’m sorry,’ she whispered to me, just before I entered the world of dreams. ‘We should have looked into other ways to save you.’
    
    ‘It’s okay, Ma,’ I murmured. ‘You did what you could. It was all you knew.’
    
    The next morning, and for the rest of my life, I stood on two legs, and looked at the world through fresh eyes."

    "text": "When they start the announcements to say the plane is landing, thank you for flying with us, put your seatbelt on and don’t be wandering about, trying to use the toilet, all the rest of it, I press my forehead against the window.

    A cloud stretches across the sky. Bright white like hotel sheets. Unbroken, so I can’t see anything below. The airport. Or where the sea turns into the Lagan. Farmhouses and their neat green fields. Wild patches of forest. The navy ikea warehouse. The mountains. My da, recovering from his operation.
    
    When he called on Tuesday evening, drunk, and asked me back, the first thought I had was about the woman he’d been seeing. I vaguely knew she was younger and they’d met in a pub. I asked could she not help and he paused. Then he said he thought she’d moved back to Lisburn. I said had she moved back or did he think she had. He said he didn’t know.
    
    No. I said. You can’t not know. She’s either living with you or she’s not. 
    
    Right. He said. Right. Yes. No. No she’s not.
    
    I could have hung up the phone then and there. It wasn’t as if it had a whole lot to do with me, really. And it wasn’t even clear what he was asking me for. To come back and stay for a few weeks. To do what? I’m no nurse. And he’s hardly bedbound, taking his food through a straw.
    
    I wondered if there was someone else I could get in the mix. We could share, or ideally they could go instead of me. If not that woman he had on the go, maybe my sister? My mum? Ha! I raised my eyebrows there, just thinking about that one. Not a chance.
    
    Right, how long would you be needing me back? I said. It might be tricky, with work. You know. Silence. Then he said if I could come in the next few days and stay over the coming weekend, maybe the one after too, he would appreciate it. I’d be grateful, son. He said. My lips stretched into a line. Two weeks he’s wanting. Two weeks?
    
    Right. I said. Right. But then I remembered the Saturday I had coming up. Kimberly’s school friend Sophia’s wedding, at a big country house in Buckinghamshire. All Kimberly’s school girlies drunk on prosecco, drinking from three in the afternoon, competitively not eating anything. There’d be tears from one of them at some point, quite possibly Kimberly. And no free bar, so I’d have to buy rounds of cocktails and shots and God knows what to keep up with the other boyfriends and husbands. When I’d asked would there be a free bar, months ago, Kimberly called me cheap and then selfish, and then we were arguing and she was crying and locking herself in the toilet. Later she shook her head while she said I had no ambition in the voice I hear her use on work video calls. It was one of those arguments where it becomes about every argument you’ve ever had, or wanted to have, but held back.
    
    Compared to all that, how bad could my da’s really be? I could head down over the weekend, go out for a few drinks with the boys, see if Ciara’s about, help him tidy up, take my work laptop to a cafe during the week, back on the Friday. Worst case the Sunday. No bother.
    
    Right, you know what. I said to my da. I think work will be fine with it. I’ll say it’s an emergency or whatever. I’ll book a flight for Friday evening then, or Saturday morning.
    
    Thank you, son. He said.
    
    But now it’s Saturday, late morning, and I’m walking through the airport, past the Tayto welcome sign and out to the taxi bay, and I’m getting these texts from him, every few minutes, saying he’ll collect me, then that he can’t because there’s a problem with the car, then that he’ll order a taxi, and next is he can’t order one but if I order he’ll pay, and I’m in the mind to block his number and book on the next flight back.
    
    I stand blinking in the sun, my T-shirt sticking to my back, faffing around with the taxi app.
    
    When we pull into his street he’s standing in the doorway, waving. He looks small and his hair is grey. He hasn’t lost his looks though, he has a kind of chiselled thing going on. He doesn’t look infirm; I can’t see any crutches.
    
    Right son. He says, as I walk around to the boot of the taxi for my bag. Need a hand there, do you?
    
    He’s smiling but I can see panic in his eyes. He always seems mystified as to how to behave around me, as if being a parent has never stopped feeling surreal to him. The way I imagine an amputee might be about their circumstances. He seems frightened of me, almost. I suppose it’s not ideal for him, having me to stay for the first time in God knows how long when he’s in this state. I nod and smile, trying to force happy eyes.
    
    He pinches a lock of my hair. You’ve grown your hair. He says.
    
    Right. I say. Right. Yes. Thank you. Will we go inside then?
    
    In his living room the full extent of the problem hits me. Plates and cups piled under his coffee table. Beer cans and wine bottles. Plastic bags everywhere. I can see a pair of trousers slung over the back of his sofa. And the smell of the place, like sour milk and old wine. Jesus Christ.
    
    Right. I say. I’ll put my bag down here, will I? I set it down on the coffee table, the one surface in the room free of debris. Right, I need the bathroom here.
    
    The bath is full of clothes. A toilet roll has unravelled across the floor and the bin is on its side.
    
    Dad. I shout from upstairs. Why are the clothes in the bath?
    
    I walk out onto the landing and shout again. He comes and stands at the bottom of the stairs.
    
    Why are they in the bath? I say. The shirts and trousers?
    
    Right. He says. Yes. Yes, they’ve just come out of the wash. They were drying on the radiators.
    
    And then? He doesn’t answer. Did you take them off the radiators and put them in the bath? I say. He walks back into the living room.
    
    The kitchen looks like a bomb’s hit it. More dishes and plastic bags. Three bin bags tied up by the backdoor with flattened cardboard boxes stacked beside them. I open the fridge and there are empty takeaway boxes filling the shelves. I find tomatoes spotted with fur, onions sprouting long fingers and a tube of green slime. The remains of an ancient cucumber.
    
    I’m throwing out these old vegetables. I shout over my shoulder. They’re absolutely stinkin’ dad. Disgusting.
    
    He says something but I can’t hear what.
    
    They’ve all turned colours they shouldn’t be. I hear him on the stairs and then opening and closing doors upstairs.
    
    I’m going out to buy things. I’m telling myself as much as him. Equipment. Bleach and things. 
    
    Out in the street I look back at his two-storey red brick terrace. I can’t see him in the upstairs bedroom but it’s possible he’s in there, standing back from the window. I wave, just in case, and walk round the corner before I take my phone out.
    
    I click through to my mum’s number. I could call, but what to say? She has her new life now, her new husband who’s a doctor, and fair play.
    
    And if this new life goes wrong she’ll claw her way to another one. Probably an even better one, knowing her. If she lost her job tomorrow she’d have another lined up the same afternoon. And if she couldn’t find one she’d be out sweeping the streets. She grew up on the Bogside and ended up working as an HR manager at KPMG. She knows you have to keep going forward no matter what. I mean everybody sort of knows that, but she really knows it.
    
    Your da is the sort of man you give one chance. She used to say, during their divorce years. It doesn’t work, you cut your losses. Get out as quick as you can. 
    
    She was too tough for him. He underestimated that. I suppose there were a lot of things I didn’t understand about her either, and probably still don’t. I never even thought about the way she would carry on, the way she would talk, until long after I stopped living with her. If you’re ever in a situation where someone is shooting at you, where you’re being shot at, don’t run. Get down on the ground and lie flat. Don’t try to run. That was one she used to say all the time, on the walk to school, if she was taking us instead of the childminder. Now can you walk that last bit by yourselves or I’ll miss the start of my meeting?
    
    When he had his affair he thought he could scrape back into her good books. No chance. She changed the locks the same day. He came back and was banging on the door. She stood in the window and phoned his mobile. Fuck. Off. She said, when he answered. And I really, truly, mean that. I mean it. 
    
    I thought she might have been calling his bluff but the day with the chicken I knew it was real. She was never one for making dinners but during that whole business she had me and Maureen sitting at the table in the evening, eating our Dunnes Stores microwave lasagnes on plates with a salad. On the Sunday, she announced we would be having Sunday lunch. I looked at Maureen and she was staring straight ahead, frowning. My mum had bought a rotisserie chicken and coleslaw and there were oven chips and steamed frozen vegetables in dishes.
    
    Help yourselves to vegetables and I’ll serve the chicken! She declared, when we were seated.
    
    That was when I saw him, carefully pushing down on the handle of the glass door to the conservatory at the bottom of the kitchen. He would have come down the alley with the bins and then climbed over the fence and crept up through the garden. His body was pressed against the glass.
    
    I said nothing but she would have seen the look on my face. She spun around. Out! She shouted. Get out!
    
    He was already in the kitchen, approaching the table, holding his hands up in the air. I made a mistake. He said. Grainnie. I made a mistake.
    
    Out! She shouted. You will not ruin this lunch. No. 
    
    Thirteen years. He said. Grainnie. Thirteen years.
    
    She stepped forward and picked up the plate holding the rotisserie chicken. He grabbed it too. I never knew why he did that. He panicked, I suppose. She pulled it back towards her and the force of the two of them tugging sent the chicken flying into the air. It landed on the kitchen tiles with a sound like a smacked bottom. I couldn’t believe it had happened, but there it was, on its back on the floor. She looked like she would kill him.
    
    They’re my children too! His voice cracked. He’s my son. Grainnie, he’s my son!
    
    Stay where you are. She said, holding her hands up beside her head. Nobody move. I’ll stick it under the tap.
    
    That seemed like the opportune moment for me and Maureen to skulk off for pizza and the computer. I looked at her. She nodded and we slid out of our chairs. They were so busy shouting their lungs out they didn’t notice. They’ve barely been in the same room since.
    
    I look down at my mum’s number again. I hold my finger above the call button and then put the phone back into my pocket.
    
    In the Spar I stand in front of the cleaning products, weighing up my options. I choose bleach and blue cloths. What else? Sponges. There’s window cleaner, but that’s the least of his problems. Bin bags. Another bleach. Green surface cleaner spray? The label says it can be used on any surface. Right, let’s get that too. I grab beers, orange juice, eggs, bread and butter on my way to the tills. At the checkout I buy him a Galaxy bar.
    
    Back at the house he’s nowhere to be seen. Dad. I shout. I’m back with the shopping.
    
    I set my bags down on the kitchen table. Dad?
    
    My phone vibrates. A text from my da: Might have a lie down here son. 
    
    I laugh. Fair play to him. I reply: No bother :). I’ll clear up
    
    I start in the front room. At first I’m sorting tins from plastic for recycling but by the middle of the first bag I’ve given up. I just chuck everything in together. Plastic cutlery. Tins. Wine bottles. The old bits of toast I find wedged down the side of the sofa. The only saving grace is the size of the place puts a limit on the mess.
    
    On my third bin bag I check my phone. No more messages from my da.
    
    One from Kimberly: Missing you! And a picture. A selfie of her in her wedding outfit.
    
    I type a reply: Sooo hot. Delete it. I look at my emoji options. The flame? Not quite right. I type Sooo hot again. Stick with that. I add: How’s the wedding?
    
    She replies instantly: Yes! Fun!!
    
    Very shrill.
    
    Another Kimberly message: Emma-Kate and Harry engaged too now!!! Last week! They waited to tell everyone in person 
    
    Oh Jesus. Another of the school girlies engaged. More pressure there. More evenings where we have to have dinners as couples and Kimberly goes to the bathroom and the girlies ask me why I haven’t proposed yet. They’ll say she wants a special location. Edinburgh Castle is the latest. A place we’ve never been. They’ll go on and on about it, plastered. Why can nobody ask me for anything when they’re sober?
    
    I reply: Omg. Class! Tell them congratulations from me 
    
    She replies: I will!! 
    
    Another message: How is your dad?
    
    I type: Jesus it’s bad. Delete it.
    
    Where would you even start with explaining him to Kimberly? She’s never met him. She’s met my mum. And then our mums met once, in London. It was like watching a cheetah and a flamingo sitting at the table having dinner. Kimberly’s mum Sara is thin and always wearing grey. Well, both the mums are thin. For different reasons, and different kinds of thin. They’re both blonde too, but different blondes. My mum’s would be more yellow. She was wearing a leopard print dress and red high heels. Kimberly’s mum asked mine what she’d done earlier. My mum said she’d gone to a museum. She said the name of an artist whose exhibition had been on. Sara pronounced the name back to her in a French accent. Well, that was it. My mum asked her what she did for work. I looked at her. She knew fine rightly Sara had always been a housewife. Sara said that Kimberly’s father had been an investment banker before he retired. And yourself? Said my mum, topping up her wine glass. It was all downhill from there. I said to Kimberly after, about them being like a cheetah and a flamingo, and she asked which one was the cheetah. I just looked at her. Well I thought it was a lovely evening. She said.
    
    I type: He’s grand like. Just needs a hand tidying up. He’s resting now
    
    I close that chat and open the one with Liam. I type: What time tonight then? I’m around from whenever
    
    I can see he is typing. I’m easy. 7? 8? Will we grab dinner before or what? 
    
    I reply: I reckon I’ll eat with my da. 8?
    
    Sweet! He replies.
    
    I open my chat with Ciara. I type: Short notice, but I’m around this weekend. Are you about? 
    
    I can see she has read it. My face feels hot. I put my phone down and pick it up again.
    
    She replies: Hello, well this is a surprise
    
    Another message: A nice one, I mean. Of course!
    
    I catch myself in the mirror, smiling down at the phone.
    
    Another message: I have a birthday I can’t get out of this evening, but shouldn’t be a late one. Or tomorrow, depending when you fly back? How come you’re back anyway?
    
    Ok sweet, I’ll be about tonight. I’ll give you a message later. If not will we say tomorrow?
    
    And it’s my da, he’d an operation. I’m helping out for a bit 
    
    Sorry to hear that. Is he alright? 
    
    Aye long story, I’ll tell you in person
    
    Ok sweet. Let’s keep in touch this evening then? 
    
    I type: Yes! For sure I look through my emojis. Beaming smile? Too matey. Too . . .  asexual. The heart eyes? Too far the other way. Would the sunglasses be funny? What would be the joke? Right, no emojis.
    
    I send: Speak soon xx
    
    I can see a message from Kimberly. I ignore it and start on the kitchen. The vegetable crisper is worse than it appeared on first inspection. Papery garlic skins plastered over the bottom. I manoeuvre it out of the fridge. But how would you clean it? I fill it with water from the kettle and stick bleach in. The acid lemon smell fills the kitchen. I leave it to sit while I take the bin bags out.
    
    His majesty surfaces when the worst is over.
    
    Right. Have you thoughts on dinner? He says, standing in the kitchen doorway. There’s a wee Indian place on the next street. Tandoori Dream it’s called.
    
    Right. Hello. I say. Yes. I’ll eat anything. 
    
    I set the table with plates and cutlery when the food arrives. He heaps white rice and beef curry onto his plate.
    
    That’s beautiful. He says, before he starts eating. For some reason this annoys me. That smells gorgeous. 
    
    Yes. Nothing beats a curry. I say. So did you sleep ok earlier?
    
    Right. Yes. He says. So have you been to any gigs lately? What bands are you listening to? 
    
    He’s said nothing about how tidy the place is. I start to wonder if sitting in front of the TV and sticking some rubbish on wouldn’t have been better.
    
    Are you still cooking? I say.
    
    That beef is beautiful. He says.
    
    You were into your cooking there for a while? I say.
    
    Right. Yes. He says. Yes. Any good shows you’re watching? 
    
    Right. I say. Ok. None come to mind. I was thinking to go out after dinner. I’ll get some pints in with Liam and some people. 
    
    Right. He says. Yes. Get the drinks in with the boys. Good man.
    
    I stick my head into the living room to give him his Galaxy bar before I leave. I got that for your dessert. I say. He’s watching TV with a bottled beer. I toss it at him. He surprises me by catching it.
    
    I check my phone after I fix my hair in the hall mirror.
    
    Messages from Kimberly: Miss you!!!
    
    Pictures of the wedding, a card with Kimberly written in swirly writing, the couple cutting the cake, a group photo of the school girlies, another selfie.
    
    I reply: Apologies, busy with my dad. Gorgeous! Looks like a class day
    
    I stick my phone back in my pocket before any other messages come through.
    
    At the pub I text Liam while I wait for the second serving of my Guinness: Where yous at?
    
    I find him at the pool table, with Rory and Conor. The sight of Rory makes me wince. His hair. No amount of combing it this or that way can take the bad look off it at this stage. He’d be better off hacking it all off. You can see too, under his jacket, that he’s gone the shape of a dessert spoon. He’s a curved back and stomach. Jesus, the sight of him makes me feel about a hundred. Conor and Liam are still in good nick, at least.
    
    Liam waves me over. Alright man. He says. He slaps my back and grasps me into a half hug. Great to see you. I repeat the gesture with Rory and Conor.
    
    Looking well. Says Rory. Looking very well. 
    
    And yourself, big lad. I say, as we sit down in a booth. And yourself. I notice their Guinnesses are only a few inches down; we’re not out a round.
    
    Right so. Says Liam. Conor is just telling us about the new girl he has on the go. Conor’s beaming.
    
    Oh aye? I say.
    
    Twenty-three. He nods, he holds his left hand up, to make the numbers with his fingers. Two. Three.
    
    What happened there with your woman? I say.
    
    Oh that’s over. All over. He says, shaking his head. Long story. Long story.
    
    Well, twenty-three, cheers to that. I say. Yes. Twenty-three is the perfect age. 
    
    Liam laughs. The perfect age, is it? Why’s that? Conor is still beaming. Rory has a dreamy look on his face.
    
    Twenty-three-year-old boys still don’t really know how to fuck. I say. She’ll think you’re God’s gift. But you can have some kind of conversation with her. It’s not like she’s still in school. But then, at the same time, you’d sound wise. 
    
    Don’t talk nonsense. Says Liam, laughing. Twenty-three-year-old boys don’t know how to fuck. He scoffs. Yes they do. Catch yourself on. 
    
    Obviously they can. I say. Technically they CAN. But they haven’t a clue what they’re doing. I hadn’t a clue. Liam shakes his head, lifts his Guinness to his lips. You hadn’t either! I say. Admit it to yourself.
    
    He’s right. Says Conor, laughing. Think about it and he’s right. You’d have had to have had a girlfriend a fair while. 
    
    Exactly. I say. So now Conor. That’s you off into the sunset now is it?
    
    I wouldn’t go that far. Conor laughs. She’d be quite thick like. 
    
    That has me spitting my Guinness out. You can count on Conor never to sugar coat it.
    
    So how’s your da then? Says Rory.
    
    Grand! I say. Aye grand. Nothing too serious. Right. Another round then lads? Liam offers to come to the bar.
    
    As we wait for the drinks he asks me again. So things are good with your da? We’re watching the barman, not looking at each other.
    
    Oh aye. I say. I think so. 
    
    Right. He says, putting a hand on my shoulder. But if you need to talk. 
    
    Right. I say. Yes. I put my hand on his shoulder too. Then we both drop them. What were my hands doing before? Just by my sides was it? Doesn’t seem right.
    
    I look around for something else to talk about, anything. I spot a familiar face on Liam’s left. Brown eyes. Long shiny hair. Sean’s little sister’s friend, or cousin? But what’s her name? Geraldine? No. Katy? If I introduce her to Liam she might say it.
    
    Alright. I say. I lean over and touch the inside of her wrist. She smiles. Good to see you. Very good to see you. I say. Oh and this is my friend Liam.
    
    Hello, I’m Roxanne. She says. Jesus, yes. Roxanne. How did I go forgetting that one? Not too many of those you meet.
    
    She glances away from me to nod politely at him. Then she’s back, smiling up at me. There’s something in her face. Adoration? I mean, she’s drunk. But she clearly has a thing for me.
    
    I was almost not going to say hello there. She says. I wasn’t sure you’d recognise me.
    
    What. You? I say, laughing. No, I wouldn’t have forgotten you. I can see her face flush. If there’s one thing I know about women it’s that they all want to think they’re unforgettable. So what are you at tonight? I say.
    
    Oh it’s a friend’s birthday. Upstairs.
    
    A birthday is it? I say. And what age is it? 
    
    It’s her twenty-fourth. She says. Actually it was mine too there, a few weeks ago. 
    
    I glance at Liam, I can’t help it. And then I bark with laughter at the look on his face. I rub my mouth right after, as if I could wipe the laugh away. That starts Liam laughing too.
    
    What’s the joke? She says.
    
    Ah it’s too long a story. I say. It’s not a good joke anyway.
    
    Right. Liam says, nodding to the pints. Will we get these back upstairs? 
    
    She hugs both of us before she heads back off to her birthday, but she definitely lingers on me.
    
    Those looks will fade. Liam says, laughing, on the way up the stairs. I tell you.
    
    Do you reckon she was that good looking? I say. I think it’s the long hair. Picture her without it like. 
    
    Oh god. He says. Guinness sloshes out of one of his glasses and onto the floor. I didn’t mean her.
    
    I know. I know. I say, laughing. Believe me. I am well aware. 
    
    As we approach our seats I get the fright of my life. Ciara is sitting in the booth, nodding along as Rory talks. She’s frowning in concentration. She always looks like that when she’s listening. And she always says sure, a lot, and nods. And you feel like she understands. And you find you can talk to her about anything. And then whatever she says about it is always surprising, because you can never really tell what she’s thinking. Which is not the only surprising thing about her. For example, every time I see her naked I’m surprised at how muscular her arms and back are, because her hands are so delicate. And every summer, when she has freckles on her nose, there is something strange about that, something uncharacteristically childlike. And the last time I slept with her I found myself saying I would end things with Kimberly. And I was surprised I’d said it but didn’t want to take it back. I couldn’t tell what she was thinking, though, which was terrifying.
    
    She took a photograph of me later that morning. She’d never done that before. I asked if I could see it and she said no, but she did show me some others. She asked me to help her choose between five to submit for an exhibition. I barely remember the photos. But I can still see her hands pointing out certain details. Then she had to go to work at the museum shop.
    
    She turns around and sees us and the concentration in her face opens out into a smile. A bright smile, but with cheekiness underneath it, with raised eyebrows. I feel like I’ve been kicked in the stomach. My face goes red. The thing is nobody else smiles like that.
    
    Hello! She says. She doesn’t stand up.
    
    Right. Hello. I say. My voice sounds shrill. Right. So, what are you doing here?
    
    It’s good to see you too. She says. The birthday I’m at is upstairs and I thought I’d have a wander around. I had a feeling you’d be here too. 
    
    Yes. No. Good to see you. Of course. I say. Great to see you, definitely. Yes. So it’s upstairs? Whose birthday is it again? I can feel my face going redder and redder.
    
    I don’t think you know them. She says.
    
    Right. Yes. I say. So what age are they turning?
    
    What? She says. Why are you so interested in this birthday? She’s the same age as me.
    
    Right. Yes. No. Great. No reason. I glance at Liam.
    
    What is it? She says. Why are you looking at Liam?
    
    Someone we know was out for a birthday pub crawl, we were hoping to avoid it. But he’s older. 
    
    Right I see. She says, shaking her head. I don’t know if she believes me. Well, Rory was just telling us about his Tinder exploits. It sounds tough out there. You were in the middle of the latest one? Did you hear from her again?
    
    Rory starts on about the date they’d had, and how well it had gone, and the follow up messages. I wonder how she’s got him onto this. But that’s what she’s like. She doesn’t seem like she’s judging you, so you find yourself telling her things. I told her that once. I’m not judging. She said. Or I try not to. You can’t get anything out of anyone that way. I hadn’t a clue what to do with that response. I tried to make a joke out of it, saying that if the photography thing didn’t work out she would make a great therapist. I think it’s all the same thing really. She said. I mean, I think that’s what art is about. Trying to understand people better. I didn’t know what to say to that. The sincerity of it.
    
    Liam and I take our seats. I’m opposite Ciara and I consider stroking her leg with my foot under the table.  I don’t even realise how bad an idea that is until my left foot is poised and ready to go. We sip our pints as Rory talks. She catches me looking at her as Rory is explaining about how he saw this girl out, after being ignored, and she pretended she’d got a new phone, and smiles.
    
    Do you fancy another drink? I say to her. We’ll go to the bar, will we? It’s my round.
    
    Thank you. She says. But I’m not drinking, actually.
    
    Right. I say. Right. Yes. Just tonight or? 
    
    No. Not just tonight. She says, smiling. I’m not really a good drinker, you know.
    
    When did that happen? I say.
    
    She laughs. What, not being a good drinker? I think always. I stopped four months ago, actually five next week. I’ll tell you all about it later. I should head back up here, but we’re going back to Claire’s after. You should all come. 
    
    Right enough. Rory says, as if she’s inviting him personally.
    
    Yes. I say, shooting him a look. Yes, we’ll all come. 
    
    Liam watches her walk across the room then turns to me. I would actually take another there, if it’s your round again?
    
    When last orders are called they’ve had six pints each. I’ve slowed down and stuck to four. Not exactly as sober as Ciara will be, but not far off. My phone is out on the table so I can see when messages come in. More from Kimberly light up the screen. I leave them. It’s not out of the question that I’d have had an early night.
    
    When I glance over and it’s Ciara’s message I grab it off the table. Liam and Conor snort with laughter.
    
    Look at you. Says Conor. Get a hold of yourself man. Liam laughs harder and Rory asks what we’re laughing at.
    
    We go into an off-licence on the walk over but we needn’t have bothered. There’s gin, vodka, whiskey, even tequila, gathered on the kitchen counter. It’s a tiny, grotty space. There’s a white cooker with its steel legs visible. Plywood cupboards. A plastic table with wooden chairs. I make us vodka lemonades and we head through to the front room where people are sitting on tattered sofas or standing in small groups.
    
    Ciara introduces us to birthday girl Claire. She has an oily chin and her hair is too short for her face so your eye can’t help but be drawn to it. Happy birthday, thanks for having us! I tell her, as we go round in a circle, saying our names. Right, good to meet you. Says Liam.
    
    Yes! Says Rory.
    
    Great. And what’s your name? I hear her ask him, as I take a seat on the sofa arm beside Ciara. A boy is drawing out lines on a shiny black book balanced on his knee.
    
    One for your friend too? He asks Ciara. Ciara turns her head to look up at me.
    
    You are? I say to her. She nods.
    
    Is it coke? I say to your man. He nods. Aye go on then. Thank you. I can stick you some money over? 
    
    Na, don’t worry about it. He says, as he goes back to organising the lines.
    
    She turns to me. I know. I know. But I’m not trying to be totally sober, like. She says. I had an edible earlier. I would still do coke, MD, whatever. Acid the odd time. Not ket, but you know I never did. Drugs never did me in the way drinking did, though. She smiles. I suppose I wouldn’t ever have afforded a drug problem. So there’s that too. She laughs. It’s not exactly a real laugh, but not totally without humour either.
    
    I hold my hands up. I didn’t say anything. No judgement from me. I could stand to cut back on the drink too.
    
    Well it’s getting older, isn’t it. She says, nodding. Can’t treat your body like shite. 
    
    I watch her cover one nostril with her thumb as she snorts her line. She wipes powder from her nostril with one finger. Gracefully, somehow. Then she passes me the book.
    
    When I look up from my line Rory is sitting there grinning at me. Any of that going? He says. I want nothing more than to tell him to go away, well away, but Ciara asks her friend before I can say anything. He says that’s grand.
    
    Thank you. Says Rory, still grinning. So here, how are the photographs going?
    
    Well. She says, glancing behind her to check on the progress of his line. They’re going. No. Yes, it’s going alright.
    
    I’d have thought there’d be no money in it? He says.
    
    God is there not? She says. There was me thinking there was. Well, thank you for telling me. 
    
    Rory takes the book. She has a good way of dealing with questions like that. Or if someone tries to wind her up deliberately, rather than just being gormless like Rory, saying what about a pension or buying a house, she’ll say something like: Well I don’t draw a pension yet, I’m not even thirty or I’m not in the market for a house just now, but thanks for asking. She raises her eyebrows as if it’s all a big joke. It’s not just the eyebrows, though, it’s the whole demeanour. It’s impossible to embarrass her, you only end up looking stupid yourself. I don’t know how she does it, but I suppose if I did it wouldn’t work.
    
    Well, here, it’s good to see you. She says to me. What brought you back? You said your dad was it?
    
    With Rory listening in I can’t very well go into the whole situation. I tell her he’s fine, mostly, having issues with his mobility and cooking, and that I offered to come back for a week or so.
    
    A week or so? Right. She nods. And what’s Kimberly at then? Did she come back too?
    
    I glance at Rory. He takes that as his invitation to speak. You were saying she was at a wedding? He says. Or was that tomorrow?
    
    I can’t see Ciara’s face and I don’t dare to turn around.
    
    Well of course it’s today. I say, tutting. Who gets married on a Sunday? Have you ever known anyone to get married on a Sunday? 
    
    Fair enough, yes. He says, nodding pensively. You’re right, now you say it. They don’t, do they? So it’s today? And who is it? That’s the worst thing about Rory. You can’t even snap at him. He doesn’t notice. Everything bounces off him.
    
    One of Kimberley’s friends. I say. A school friend, I don’t know her so well. 
    
    I hear Ciara laugh from down at my elbow. A real laugh, with warmth and depth to it. There’s no snideness I can detect. So you thought you’d get out of it, did you? Didn’t fancy a night out with the girlies? She says. You used your dad to get out of it? What are you like! 
    
    No. No, he did need help. I say, laughing too, trying not to sound nervous. No, the two things are separate. I would have gone. I didn’t not want to go, no. I look down at her and she raises her eyebrows, but I don’t get the sense I’m in real trouble.
    
    The book comes back again. We each do another line. I scan the room, checking if Liam or Conor is nearby for me to send Rory their way. Liam is in the corner, chatting to a pretty girl wearing a leather skirt. Great legs. Not fair to land him with it. No sign of Conor. Right, he’s my problem then.
    
    I like weddings. Says Rory. He’s gazing into the distance with his dreamy look. I like the dancing, all the different age groups. Good craic. 
    
    Hmm. Says Ciara. I suppose it depends who’s getting married.
    
    Yes. Good craic. I say, searching in what he’s said, for a hook to a different conversation.
    
    Have you thought for yourself man? He says to me, still with the dreamy expression. Would you be getting married anytime soon? Would you propose, do you reckon? 
    
    Ciara laughs. A sharp bark. But still warm, on balance. I think.
    
    Right. Well, no. I say. No, I hadn’t planned. I won’t. With Kimberley. I don’t think it’s the right thing. It’s a for now thing.
    
    Is it? Says Rory. Oh I didn’t know that. Now his face is imploring. As if I’ve said something grave.
    
    I don’t think he knows what he wants either, Rory. She says. Or he does but he says one thing and he means another. That’s what he’s like.
    
    Oh. Says Rory. Oh right.
    
    I can tell she’s looking at me, not Rory. He stares at me too, with doleful eyes. I turn to face her.
    
    It’s complicated. I say. That’s all it is. 
    
    What’s complicated? She says.
    
    You know. We live together. I say. Her dad owns the house.
    
    She looks at me like I’ve announced I’ve an alien with me, hiding under my jacket. Jesus Christ. She says, kneading her forehead. So you move somewhere else. That’s what you do in that situation. You. Move.
    
    No. I say. No, but it’s not that easy. It’s not the same as it is for you. To just move. You don’t have to. Well. It’s not as easy. I stop myself from saying that she just does what she wants. Because I know what she’ll say to that: why don’t I? And I have no good answer there.   
    
    No, go on. She says. What is it I don’t have to do? Really? How can it be my fault if you don’t like your life? It’s nothing to do with me. No, you know what? I won’t have it. I have to make the same choices as anyone else. I don’t have a magic key or whatever it is you think I have. You can all joke about me not having money or whatever stupid thing it is next time. Have a good laugh. But you can’t carry on as if I have a magic key at the same time. 
    
    Oh no I wasn’t joking. Says Rory. I’m sorry. 
    
    Shut. Up. She says, without turning her head.
    
    Sorry, yes. He says. Right. I’m away to take a piss here. He gets up and slides out of his corner, his stomach almost grazes our faces.
    
    I didn’t say you had a magic key. I say. I can sense the room watching us. That’s not what I said. 
    
    Don’t speak to me like I’m stupid. She says. Don’t give me that. You know the key is metaphorical. You know what I’m talking about. 
    
    She’s right. I do know what the magic key is: it’s when I act as if she’s been given special permission from someone, somewhere, to live the way she wants to and I haven’t. The fact is neither of us has special permission. Or, I suppose we both do. You could look at it that way.
    
    Sorry, yes. I say. I do know. I shouldn’t have said that. I’m sorry.
    
    Right. Let’s forget about it. She says. Is there another line of coke there?
    
    She snorts hers then passes me the book. I’m glad of the conciliatory gesture, thinking we really are putting it behind us. Then she starts talking.
    
    So the wedding was today and you flew in this morning? She says. And you texted me today. Right. And when did your dad get out of the hospital? 
    
    I weigh up whether I should lie. No, not worth it.
    
    Right. I say. So it was two weeks ago he got out. But he was saying he was fine. And he was saying his girlfriend was there. Well, no. It’s not that he was saying she was, but he wasn’t saying she wasn’t, if you get me.  
    
    Yes. She says. So when did he ask you back?
    
    Thursday. I say. And then with work.
    
    But you could have come on Friday? You could have come to help your dad on the Friday. She says. When are you leaving? Actually you know what, don’t bother? I’m going to head home here. 
    
    I don’t think she’s serious but then she’s on her feet and getting her things together, saying goodbye to her friends while everyone looks at me like I’ve about seventy heads. God knows what she’d have done if I’d told the truth about when he called.
    
    I smile and nod and follow her out into the street. She’s about a dozen houses away but she’s not running. That’s something.
    
    Ciara! I shout. She stops instantly; the second good sign. That’s another thing I know about women, though. They all love a big, grand display. Even Ciara. To be chased after, phoned in the middle of the night, praised in superlatives. You can make up for a lot by doing something like that. You just have to not be embarrassed to do it. Look, I’m sorry! I shout. Here, wait there. I jog towards her.
    
    She’s standing under a lamp post, framed by orange light. I try to get a read of her body language, planning what to say. Her arms are folded, but her shoulders are hunched. She’s made herself small. She’s not poised for a shouting match; it’s a hug I think.
    
    I pull her towards me and she doesn’t push back. No, she wraps her arms around me, tighter than I was expecting. Her face is buried in such a way that it takes me a few seconds to realise she’s crying.
    
    Ciara? I whisper. I try to lift her head but she shakes it, presses herself further into my chest.
    
    It’s the coke. I can hear her say. It’s the coke. It’s the coke. I’m crying because we did all that coke. 
    
    I smooth her hair. The thing is she won’t have wanted to make a scene. I wait until I feel her body relax.
    
    Will we go back to yours? I whisper.
    
    She pulls away. Slowly, though. She wipes under her eyes. No. She says. I don’t think so, you know. 
    
    It’s a no that wants to be a yes, though. A no that wants to be talked around.
    
    Just to talk, I mean. I say.
    
    She laughs, the relieved laugh that often follows a cry. That’s what we do isn’t it?
    
    I’m not that drunk. I say. If you don’t want to take me home because you think I’m too drunk, I can promise you I’m not that drunk.  
    
    She wipes under her eyes again. No it’s not that. 
    
    If it’s because you have things to do tomorrow then I promise I’ll leave, I won’t be a pest. 
    
    No it’s not that. I don’t have work tomorrow. 
    
    If there’s someone you’re seeing you can tell me. I say. I’m a big boy. 
    
    No. Nobody in particular anyway. 
    
    I can see I’m getting there. I take her hands.
    
    Seriously. I say. The wedding. I explained that badly. I know. Words start coming from nowhere. When my dad got out of hospital he was saying it was all fine, and he never mentioned your woman had left. I don’t even know when she did. I don’t think it’s specifically the operation. But he is bad. Jesus, you should see him. 
    
    She squeezes my hands. I can feel every emotion I’ve had for the entire day fighting to get to the surface.
    
    And it’s just me. I can’t. 
    
    I know. She says, she moves her thumbs up and down the outside of my hands. I breathe in and out. I know. He’s a drinker too, isn’t he?
    
    Oh, yes. I say. Well yes but no. He’s a big drinker, like. But that’s not the problem. It’s more like a nervous breakdown, I suppose you would call it? I want to laugh but I’m scared I’ll lose control and cry. You know that kind of way? 
    
    Yes. She says. I think I know. 
    
    You know what it is? He won’t face up to anything. Words from nowhere again. I don’t know what happened with this woman this time, but it’s always the same. It never works out, and then she’ll vanish, and he’s back to square one. It’s like he can’t see the consequences of anything, or he doesn’t want to. Then things never work out how he wants. With my mum, you know, that was predictable to everyone but him. He never got over her, you know. I stop for more deep breaths.
    
    I know. She says, massaging my hands with her thumbs.
    
    This time he seems to just want to hide himself away. I say. It’s like he never accepted his life was his real life. Do you know that kind of way?
    
    I think I know the way you mean. She says.
    
    Right, sure. I smile, the threat of a cry seems to have dissipated. Yes, fair play. 
    
    We can get a coffee if you want to talk about your dad? She says. This week sometime?
    
    What, still no? I say.
    
    You don’t really want a pity fuck. She says but she hasn’t dropped her hands.
    
    I might. I say.
    
    She laughs then.
    
    Does anyone make you laugh like I do? I say. Anyone else? I’m pulling out all the stops here. I didn’t even call you crazy earlier. I could have. 
    
    Thank you. She says. Thank you for affording me that dignity.
    
    I know why you’re annoyed. I say. I said I was thinking of leaving Kimberley and didn’t. But can I remind you, you never said anything in that conversation. You didn’t say to do it. You said nothing. 
    
    It’s not my decision to make. She says.
    
    That’s not it. I say. The truth of it is you don’t think it would work between us. But I know it could. 
    
    She smiles. So there’s your decision made?
    
    You still haven’t said what you think. 
    
    Do you think you wouldn’t resent me if you had to live with me?
    
    Well, you wouldn’t. There’s lots of things you don’t do. For example, you wouldn’t want me to propose. 
    
    She shakes her head. I’m not sure that sounds how you want it to sound. 
    
    You know what I mean. 
    
    You’re right. I wouldn’t want that. Don’t propose. She says. Here, do you know what the phrase object permanence means?
    
    What? I say. Actually, yes. Yes I do. It’s when a baby can’t remember their toy unless it’s in front of them. But no. I don’t have that. If that’s what you’re saying I have. 
    
    For a few seconds I think she’s going to kiss me.
    
    Right. I’m away to bed, here. She says. Goodnight.
    
    She still hasn’t let go of my hands. To bed? You just had to ask. I say. One last try, why not.
    
    She squeezes my hands before dropping them.
    
    Then the coffee? I say. Let’s do that. This week.
    
    Sounds good. She says. Text me.
    
    I watch her walk down the street. I think about running after her but this time the grand display is to let her go.
    
    Back at my da’s I find his lordship asleep on the sofa in his newly-clean living room. Not lying down, just sitting with his head slumped forward.
    
    No chance of getting him up the stairs. I pull the blanket out from under him and try to negotiate him onto his side. He grumbles in his sleep and starts to hum.
    
    In the name of the Father. He shouts. His eyes open.
    
    Jesus don’t get religious on me now boyo. I whisper.
    
    What? He says. Son. What? My son. You’re my son. You’re the same as you always were.
    
    Right. I say. Thank you. Bed now. 
    
    He lies down on his side and is straight back asleep. He’ll have no memory of this in the morning. As if he’d bring it up if he did.
    
    I sit down on the bed and get my phone out. I can see messages from Kimberley. I swipe them off the screen. I open my chat with Ciara.
    
    I type: Talk tomorrow? No, no question mark. Jesus Christ, man. Not a question mark. What are you playing at? No, but not nothing after that tomorrow. Can’t just leave it sitting there like that. xx? Aye, try that.
    
    I type: Home safe? Talk tomorrow xx. Yes, much better. Send.
    
    And I do mean it. We will talk. I’ll text, I might even call. She’d like that.
    
    I can see her friends from last night asking about me. What was his craic, then? Did you get rid of him. She could say: oh aye, he’s always chasing after me but he has a girlfriend he won’t leave. He’s lonely because of stuff with his dad, and he’s had a big crush on me from way back.
    
    Jesus she could tell them I phone her every year on Christmas Eve and if she doesn’t answer I leave about seven messages and voice messages too. God the things she could say.
    
    But she wouldn’t do that. I trust her. That’s probably why I do any of that stuff.
    
    I’ll tell her that tomorrow. Or I’ll as much as tell her. I’ll say, I appreciate you not making a big thing or what have you the other night. She’ll know what I mean.
    
    She replies instantly: Yes! Just in. Speak tomorrow xxxx
    
    Four x’s? Very nice.
    
    There’s a conversation there we haven’t ended. I’ll pick it up tomorrow. But, whatever, tomorrow doesn’t solve tonight.
    
    I open up Instagram and type Roxanne into the search. No hits in the first few profiles. I try a different spelling before navigating to Sean’s profile. I search his followers under Rox. Yes, there she is. Bingo! Follows me already. Good stuff.
    
    I unzip my jeans and reach my right hand into my boxers. I swipe through her photos with my hand on my dick, using my left hand to navigate the phone. Holiday photos in a bikini. Night out photos in bodycon dresses. Not doing it. Probably can’t even get hard in person because of the coke. But in the morning? Different story. I click follow back and then open up the messages.
    
    What would be the worst thing I could possibly send her?
    
    I want you to suck my dick and then let me cum on your tits and then let me spread it all over them while I finger you
    
    I smile at that. Tame in my old age.
    
    I want to bend you over your bed and fuck you in the ass
    Will you let me cum in your asshole?
    I’m scared about my dad and I’m lonely. Can I spend the night with you?
    I’m a spineless prick
    
    Jesus. God. Fuck.
    
    I type: I really want to fuck you so badly. Delete it.
    The really. Too much?
    I type it out again: I want to fuck you so badly
    Somehow more too much than it was with the really.
    I type: I really want to fuck you sooo badly 
    
    Yes! Send!
    
    I can see she’s read it. The moment of truth. She starts typing. She replies: Hello! You still out then? "

    "text": "Finn opened the door. Finn Lykke opened the door wearing jeans and a freshly-ironed, white shirt, he had made an effort. He gave me a hug and I felt more at ease while it lasted. Unni, Helle and I followed him into the living room which looked much like the living room where we had spent last Saturday except this one was empty, there was no one on the sofa, Finn said that Stein and Lars had gone to get beer; fortunately they soon turned up with bags that jingled with promise and set them down on the table, it was starting to look like a party. We opened the beers and drank and Finn sat down next to me and put his arm around me and seemed taller than the last time we had seen each other and much more relaxed than last Saturday, what a difference one meeting on an ordinary Wednesday could make. They had played an ice hockey match that morning and had won, they said, and they drank to that and clinked their bottles, we all drank to that, and Finn had scored a goal, they said, and described it and I imagined Finn in his ice hockey kit, his helmet and cage and big shoulder pads, how he wove and criss-crossed his way forward, hitting the puck with his stick, slamming it into the goal. I realised that I was more in love with the version of him in his ice hockey kit than the one sitting next to me on the sofa, I avoided looking at him, I drank.

    Luckily Lars put on some music so loud that it was difficult to talk, that was the whole point, I guess, he pulled Unni out on the floor and Stein pulled Helle out on the floor and Finn pulled me out on the floor and we danced with a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other, Lars changed the records and we danced more slowly and we set down the bottles and stubbed out the cigarettes and put our arms around each other and started to make out.
    
    We made out to lots of songs before Finn took my hand and guided me out into the hallway where no lights were on and there, in the twilight, we made out more passionately. He pressed me softly against the wall and slipped his right hand under my jumper and under my best bra and cupped my breast as promisingly as he had done in the playground at Berg College just a few days ago, and after what I thought was nice but long enough, he removed his hand, took mine and led me towards the stairs, then up the stairs, up the steps to the first floor where I assumed the bedrooms were.
    
    I will never forget it, the stairs leading up to what I guessed must be the bedrooms. The carpet stair runner, burgundy with a golden border which didn’t go right to the sides of the steps so you could see the wood, the runner itself was kept in position by thin metal rods in the corners of each riser. How strange, I thought while Finn Lykke led me up the stairs to the first floor that I was on my way to something I would never forget, which would become a chapter in my life, one of the most important. Even before it had happened, I already knew that it would be a chapter in my life that I would never forget, I knew in advance that it would be unforgettable. How strange was that? On my way up the stairs on a burgundy runner with a golden border held in place by thin brass rods in the corners of each riser behind Finn Lykke in his jeans and freshly-ironed, white shirt.
    
    We reached a passage with four closed doors, he walked to the one furthest to the left and I followed with my hand in his until he let go of it, opened the door and turned on the light in what looked like a guest bedroom, it seemed uninhabited. A made-up bed and a bedside table, a window facing the road with the curtains closed, a sink to the left of the door, a chair to the right. He closed the door behind us and started to undress, he undid, without fear it seemed to me, the buttons of his freshly-ironed, white shirt, took it off and tossed it on the chair, bent over his belt and the zip of his jeans, took them off and tossed them on the chair as if I weren’t there, then he took off his socks, first one, then the other and stood in front of me in his underpants, then he took off his underpants and stood naked in front of me with fair pubic hair and blond tufts under his armpits, small, almost inverted nipples, but he didn’t seem to notice me. Suddenly he looked lost and went back to the clothes he had just thrown on the chair, picked up his jeans and searched the pockets and while he was busy doing that, looking for something in the pockets of his jeans, I undressed as quickly as I could in order to do it without him looking at me, I put my clothes on the bedside table, my best jumper, my best trousers, my best bra, my best knickers and socks, I put everything on the bedside table and slipped under the bedspread and the duvet while he was still rummaging around his pockets for something without saying a word, in a great silence. I lay under the duvet, watching him, naked, with fair pubic hair and blond tufts under his armpits, then he found what he was looking for, a condom, I could see, which he tried to open, but couldn’t. He tried to tear off the wrapper, but he still couldn’t, he had to use his teeth to finally get it out and then he tried to put it on, but failed because he didn’t have an erection, his small, pale, flaccid penis dangled between his thighs. I turned carefully and slowly towards the wall so the bed wouldn’t creak and draw his attention to me, but my ears pricked up when I heard the snapping of rubber and his breathing, his frustrated breathing because he couldn’t put on the condom. Then I heard him approach the bed, he came towards the bed in which I lay and he lifted up the duvet and climbed in and lay down behind me, leaned on his elbow and touched my shoulder in order to turn me over. I turned over voluntarily, I rolled onto my back and he kissed me and got on top of me and started moving his hips in the way men do during sex, as I had seen in Unni’s dad’s porn magazines and his blue movies, and which I had so often imagined and dreamed about, except Finn wasn’t inside me. I didn’t know much, but this much I did know because I used tampons when I had my period and knew what it was like to have something inside me, and he wasn’t. His head slumped over my shoulder, his panting wet mouth brushed my neck, he moved his hips as men do during sex, except this wasn’t intercourse because he wasn’t inside me, I didn’t know much, but this much I did know.
    
    I whispered to him that he wasn’t inside me. Finn, you’re not inside me, but he didn’t seem to hear me, he was wrapped up in himself, his panting breath against my neck, the back of his neck flushed and tense. Finn, you’re not inside me, but he carried on thrusting his hips against mine, he leaned on me with all of his body, with his whole weight, with his face in the nape of my neck and his hair in my mouth. Finn, you’re not inside me, but he still didn’t hear, he panted and groaned and pushed, then he suddenly stopped, raised himself up on his hands and swung his legs over the side of the bed, he got up and stood in front of me, he still didn’t have an erection and the condom slipped off. He bent down, retrieved it and held it up to the light from the ceiling lamp to study it, went over to the sink, turned on the tap and filled the condom with water, he held it up to the light once more and examined it to make sure it hadn’t burst, he said, so he did know that I was there. He had filled the condom with water and held it up to the ceiling light to see if there was a tear or a hole in it, but it looked intact.
    
    I sat up slowly and swung my legs over the side of the bed, I took the opportunity to get dressed while he checked if there was a hole or a tear in the condom he had put on his penis, which hadn’t been inside me, my best knickers, my best bra, jumper and trousers and socks and I tiptoed to the door, I put my hand on the handle and turned to him and said that I was going to join the others. He glanced at me and nodded, busy with his own stuff, the condom. I walked down the stairs I had only just walked up so filled with anticipation, on the burgundy stair runner with the golden border kept in place by slim gold- coloured metal rods at the corners of each riser, on my way down from something I would never forget, which would become a chapter in my life, a defining moment. I could hear music from the living room, soft and romantic, the others were making out in the corners of separate sofas, but they stopped when I came in and they looked at me curiously, Helle and Unni with grave and solemn faces, I smiled cautiously and sat down in a vacant corner and could feel their eyes on me, but I didn’t say anything, there wasn’t much to say, after all, there was nothing to tell. Then we heard footsteps on the stairs and in the hallway, and soon afterwards Finn Lykke entered the living room, nicely dressed in jeans and a slightly crumpled white shirt and made a beeline for the sofa where I was sitting, he had a smug smile on his face and his gait was like Unni’s when she walked into the playground in the morning after spending the previous evening with Lars behind the bus shelter after the Workers Youth League meetings. Finn entered the living room and walked towards me with his new, casual swagger, as proud as a peacock, sat down next to me, put his arm around my shoulder and whispered in my ear: Now I’ve made a woman of you.
    
    And that’s how I became a woman.

    "text": "An hour before surgery Dr Duncan ducked into the men’s bathroom. The women’s was another twenty-minute walk away and usually, on this side of the hospital, the bathroom was empty. But there was Ian, a surgical resident, posed against the grotty sinks. His phone lifted above his head, angled down, one hand moving beneath the blue of his scrubs. The moment he saw her, he stopped. A statue. But he did not withdraw his hand. The shape of his fingers flattened as he launched into an apology.

    It’s just a photo, he spoke softly. It’s just a photo, honestly.
    
    I shouldn’t have been in here, Dr Duncan replied. It’s fine.
    
    Still he did not withdraw his hand. He put his phone beside the sink, screen down. Unhygienic, she thought, looking at the phone, imagining the dirty glass pressed to his ear. The bathroom’s details were otherwise familiar. She knew which cubicle had the cracked toilet seat, which tap ran viciously hot. Before he could say anything else she stepped back into the corridor.
    
    Had things gone differently, Dr Duncan would have let Ian take the lead on the appendectomy. He’d have had the opportunity to gently push the tube, containing the light and camera, through the opened belly button and watch the inching of the large intestine as it appeared on the screen. Instead she would perform the first cut. Skin prised underneath the blade. The camera sunk in. She would have remarked, had Ian been holding the scalpel, that the large intestine was like a sea monster, mythical, moved along by its own pink pulse. She would have shaken her head and expressed her awe at the human body, asked him to consider that he might be the only person to ever see this part of the patient, that it was important not to let the significance of that intimacy pass you by. But Dr Duncan had changed her mind.
    
    Ian paused, seemingly unfazed, beside the operating table. His hands in blue latex gloves. He did everything handsomely. He was gay, very gay, in his own words, and the other female residents flocked to him, knowing they wanted a piece of the ancient light that bounced off his body.
    
    At Dr Duncan’s command, Ian dutifully took the disposal razor and tried to shave the top rows of the patient’s pubic hair. He struggled to find the right angle, twisting his elbows this way and that, dragging too lightly across the tough hairs, then too hard, threatening to nick the skin. One of the nurses flinched. When it was done, the low boil of a rash left behind, he did not look at Dr Duncan. He focused on the screen that showed the camera’s worming journey.
    
    This would be the last operation of Dr Duncan’s shift. Later she would collect her son from the airport. He’d chosen a cheap flight, one that landed just before midnight. She had not seen him in a few months. Alex, who had grown up to be tall and broad, who was also handsome.
    
    As the camera advanced through the bowel, she hummed quietly, a kind of theme tune. Alex had got into a decent university, if a little far away, and at eighteen was now old enough that they indulged in similar tastes; he claimed to like red wine, which he swished and swilled, named music she remembered from when she was his age. He’d told her, on his last visit, that he and his friends had drunk the bottle she’d sent to him out of stained mugs, knowing it might rile her. She resisted. Well, as long as you enjoyed it. Oh, we did, he said, insinuating what was just out of shot, the part of the picture she couldn’t see.
    
    Through the belly button she filled the patient’s abdomen with gas, pushing out the walls of the large intestine, making it easier to navigate the sluggish turns. After that came the camera and the private, fleshy undertones, the surfaces slick and shining.
    
    The appendix appeared. Half of it already distended, deep maroon, a twisted and flashing smile. Dr Duncan was satisfied. She had been right. The patient, who had arrived yesterday evening, complaining of pain in her right-hand side, no fever but an elevated white blood cell count, had been suffering from appendicitis. Now it had been caught before a perforation. She announced this to Ian, asked him to look at the appendix, veins drifting thin as hair, the bloated glow. He nodded over her shoulder. Briefly her elbow made contact with his chest.
    
    The patient had tattoos. Not only down her arms but, as Dr Duncan looked back at her body from the screen, along the tops of her thighs. One was a quote in cursive that was too difficult to read upside down, then a giant flower, maybe a magnolia, that bloomed all the way to her knee. There was a smaller scene, birds across a sunset, a boat, the whole thing very elaborate.
    
    Dr Duncan had her own tattoo. In black ink along her ribs, on the left-hand side. It was Alex’s full name, Alexander, done when he was already twelve years old. She’d practised writing it out beforehand, wanted it in lower case, lengthening the first ‘e’ so it would not be immediately recognisable as his, adding a flourish to the ‘r’. A literal impulse, she knew. Her body was already marked by his birth, the scar of the C-section faint but still visible across her stomach. It was around the time that the name she’d given him had begun to permanently change, his loud friends calling him Al, or, inexplicably, X. Her ex-husband, too, who had never said Alexander. Right from the beginning, he had always used Alex. These were the names her son chose to have on his homework, the signatures he gave on her birthday cards.
    
    At the parlour, sitting on an old leather sofa, she’d been asked about placement. The tattoo artist listed body parts with bizarre distortions, inside finger, soft bit of forearm, lower-back dip, upper-back spine, pelvic gutter. Just somewhere it won’t be seen, she’d stated. He’d twisted then, pointed to his own ribcage. Yes, there.
    
    Dr Duncan clamped and quickly clipped the appendix free. It was then scooped out in a small wire basket, which, despite the meticulously tried and tested design, always made Dr Duncan think of catching fish in a deep-fat fryer. At the incision’s entrance, she repositioned and slowly pulled the appendix through. The patient’s skin puckered, beastly, glorious, protesting with an organised spill of blood.
    
    Hey presto, she said aloud.
    
    Ian smiled too large behind his mask, she saw the lift of his eyes, thrilled by a catchphrase that barely belonged to her.
    
    The whole idea, she added quickly, was of course to avoid perforation while it was still inside the body, thus the basket, thus the swift and gentle exit.
    
    Thus, Ian echoed, hey presto.
    
    Dr Duncan did not advance. She let the appendix hover over the patient’s body. In Ian’s tone she’d heard the arrogance of a private joke, where no joke had been shared. He stood, hands outstretched and empty. She took another few seconds. Brought the appendix close to her face. Saw again confirmation that her instincts were good, that she’d been right to operate. She pinched it and felt the leathery resistance of the infected end. The other half was still bright, spongy. Another couple of days though, even one more day, and it might have burst.
    
    She passed it on to Ian, who stepped away. Set the appendix in a metal bowl. A nurse collected it. From this moment on it would become a specimen, sent to the hospital lab for a few further tests, which would most likely reveal nothing they couldn’t already see.
    
    On the way to the airport she would need to stop at the supermarket. Dr Duncan wondered whether she should buy the body wash her son liked. Last time she’d noticed, when she’d gone into the bathroom after he’d used it, a strong minty smell that carried on the residual steam. He’d brought with him small, travel-size containers, a brand she didn’t recognise at first but had since seen in a pharmacy, on the shelves of the supermarket. Maybe he used something different, now. That had been two, no, three months ago.
    
    The small opening in the large intestine was stapled shut. Gas was released from the patient’s abdomen. Later she might experience a pain both sharp and blunt between her shoulder blades, as if she had been flicked and the flick had held, as a few escaped bubbles travelled north. The patient, hopefully, would have only one night in hospital before being discharged. There had been an anomaly, blood in her urine, but this could be an oncoming period, unrelated to the appendicitis. On admission the patient could not remember where she was in her cycle. Mid? she’d replied, eyebrows raised, as if this was something Dr Duncan could confirm.
    
    She allowed Ian to stitch the incision across the abdomen. She pointed at the opened belly button, the smaller, second incision to the left.
    
    Do those too, and do them well.
    
    He nodded, his eyes on the abdomen.
    
    Yes?
    
    Yes, I’ll do them.
    
    Alex saw her tattoo when he was thirteen, a year or so after she’d had it done. They were on a beach holiday and she’d opted to wear a bikini. It was just the two of them, her divorce already under way and her ex-husband living moodily in a new city. She waited, that first day in the sun, for Alex to ask what was written beneath her armpit. He stalked the shoreline, crouching to sort through shells, his legs and ankles thick with those interim years, his body not yet ascended into the muscle and stretch of teenagedom. He glanced at her tattoo, or at least she thought he had, but said nothing. She became bolder, turned, angled her left-hand side so it faced him. Still nothing. He was a private child and it seemed he’d given her this in return, a privacy, whether she wanted it or not. She supposed, applying suncream to the backs of his legs, his neck, the tops of his ears, the places he forgot, that this was being a mother.
    
    The nurses wheeled the patient into the recovery bay. Many patients, as they saw Dr Duncan standing over their bodies, the pain of which they could not yet feel, would sob softly. She knew that this was for various, impersonal reasons. Namely the thinning out of the general anaesthetic, the patients arriving back into the world on a foreign, tidal pull. They would remember nothing of the interaction afterwards.
    
    As the patient’s eyelids bobbed, the eyeballs searching underneath the delicate skin, Dr Duncan stood beside her and waited. The patient’s hair was short, curly, shaved beside the ears. As she opened her eyes Dr Duncan could see the surgery’s effect, her pupils lost to its heavy weather. Sure enough the patient began to sob silently, to reject the tube in her throat. Her hand, the cannula tugging in her forearm, moved to find Dr Duncan, who squeezed her palm.
    
    It’s all fine, everything is fine, it went very well indeed.
    
    The patient nodded. Fell back to sleep.
    
    Another mother – was it her own? – said to her that you knew a child’s body best in illness. It was true enough. When he was six, Alex had two bouts of pneumonia. In bed for a month, then more. She intuited when he was lying on his back from the distant wheeze in his exhale. If he was lying on his front, the note would shift into a whistle. A long, boneless breath meant he could not easily be woken, that his fever remained at a peak. She could recall the scatter of his room, toys boxed in by other toys, arranged in concentric audiences, just as he’d left them before he was ill. She never tidied them away. The bears watched the toy soldiers who watched the race cars who watched the marbles. There was the pretty way Alex looked at her, too, eyes glassy, his hair spread neat and still against the pillow. As an adult he claimed not to remember any of it. She’d tried to prompt him. Mentioned the splendid delirium of his dreams. That when she’d soothed him he’d press into her neck and offer solitary, wandering words. Rhubarb, otter, flute. He’d only shake his head. Sorry, guess I was pretty out of it! Key, grass, hat.
    
    Ian watched Dr Duncan reassure the patient. The way he leaned into the door frame, his hip tilted, arms folded, indicated that it was she, Dr Duncan, who might have something to learn. To leave the room she had to walk right up to him, see his arms fall back to his sides, palms wiped briefly on his thighs. He moved with her into the corridor. An urgency in his proximity. He spoke too close to her ear.
    
    That all went smoothly, didn’t it?
    
    What do you think?
    
    Her authority was lessened, she felt, by the way her shoes squeaked against the pale green linoleum. She did not want his apology. It was building in him, she could feel it, that terrible crescendo. Twice he inhaled deeply. Twice he released the sigh through his nose, sounding all the dramatic tones of a poorly played instrument. Nothing had to be acknowledged. In this, the aftermath, they ought to dim the bathroom’s unforgiving brightness, let the scene, the slow movement of his hand, recede into whatever darkness. Time would take care of things. When it came to the next appendectomy she would likely let him make the first cut.
    
    She kept on walking, though was no longer sure where she should walk to. She was concerned Ian might place his hand on her shoulder. He kept pace, watching his feet, or listening to hers.
    
    The first or second day of his residency she found Ian’s eyes washed up on her collarbone. He watched the movement of her two necklaces, how they’d entwined, seeking out the disc the size of a thumbprint, St Christopher hunched over and on his sanctified way. Later, when she’d removed her jewellery for a gallbladder procedure, Ian had watched again, this time following her fingers as she’d worked the two clasps, then dropped the necklaces into the small dish.
    
    Was there anything else?
    
    No, no. Ian retreated.
    
    Dr Duncan slipped into a nurses’ station. Brewed a coffee. Ran through the meals she had made Alex on his last visit. On the final night she’d cooked a chicken chasseur, a dish she’d recently learned. It had never occurred to her to take apart a whole chicken, to lever the knife through the joints, slide out the breasts. Alex wandered into the kitchen. Mum, Jesus, that’s a bit intense. Still, he’d stood and watched, impressed, unable to fight his own fascination. Once she finished the job, her hands washed, she turned to face him. He was holding his breath tightly. It was a child’s habit, the lesson learned early on, an attempt to pause fear, to force the chest steady. Between them was an anticipatory silence, the rock before it hits the water. She waited. He certified some unknown feature of her gaze. Said absolutely nothing where there was something. He gave up their moment quickly, breaking it with a yawn, a faux stretch. He pointed at her new and enormous knife. Fucking hell, so when did you buy that?
    
    She checked the clock above the sink. The surgery had been faster than scheduled. Alex would be at the airport waiting to board. He did like to send a message, to let her know that it was all on time, add the crossed-fingers emoji, sometimes a blue heart. The university was not so far away. If he’d learned to drive then he could have covered the distance by car. But he’d shown no interest, none of the usual boyish and chaotic excitement that she had seen in his schoolmates. When she’d pushed, explained that it wasn’t so hard, that he should really get on with it, his lack of interest had become a kind of protest.
    
    Dr Duncan had taken the next day off. She would not be around to, if all went well overnight, discharge the patient herself. She wanted some time with Alex. Had not told him though, it occurred to her now, and he might have made other plans. There were still a couple of school friends that hadn’t yet gone to university, working instead, saving money to travel. There was a moment when Alex might have done the same. A couple of years ago he kept a world map preciously on his bedroom wall. Made his own key, a star for where he definitely wanted to go, a circle for a maybe. Dotted lines showed flight paths, a few costs had even been labelled. But then his plan had changed with no explanation, the whole map ripped down. Not thrown away, she’d noticed, but folded and slid underneath his bed.
    
    She decided on a lasagne. An old dish, the kind of thing she’d batch-cooked when Alex was still a pre-teen, enjoyed a little fame for it, his friends requesting it when they came to stay. They could eat it tomorrow night. She’d already ordered some decent red wine online, planned to put his palate to the test, and he’d roll his eyes but be quietly pleased.
    
    Her office was small and virtually pointless. She was almost never in it. But she took a moment now to check her phone. Sipped her coffee. Yes, Alex had sent two messages, All on time! Followed by his blue heart. She replied with a thumbs up. She ought to write a shopping list, knew the way her mind could slip once she left the hospital.
    
    A gentle knocking. Ian spoke into the crack in the door, not showing his face.
    
    Do you have a minute?
    
    Exactly one.
    
    So it would have to happen, this apology. He did not enter the room immediately. She imagined he rehearsed his lines again, a phraseology second-guessed and adjusted.
    
    Are you coming in?
    
    He closed the door gently. Please, she wanted to scream, dear God, don’t create an atmosphere. The office was ugly. There were no paintings on the walls, not a photo in sight.
    
    How can I help?
    
    I just wanted to say that before, he cleared his throat, with what happened before, I don’t want you to get the wrong idea, those photos, they were just for my boyfriend, that’s all, it’s just a bit of fun.
    
    There was a benefit, at least, to being the bearer of forgiveness. In the long beat of an apology, there is a luxury of seconds, a surplus, permission to really look at a person. The expert melancholia in his eyes. His skin very clear, his nails very short, a nice shape. A scar, like a white comma, across the knuckle of his pinky finger.
    
    Please. She held up her hand. It’s fine, like I said before, I shouldn’t have been in the men’s. She leaned forward for effect. I should say though, while we’re here, that it’s just important to be professional. That’s all I ask, for you to conduct yourself in a certain way. Don’t get upset, it’s just part of the job, an easy part if you’d just let it be easy.
    
    He sucked in his cheeks.
    
    I do, I do see.
    
    Good, that’s all I ask.
    
    She pretended to dial a number. Nodded. Waved him back out of the door.
    
    Dr Duncan wondered if it was true, whether Ian really had sent the picture to his boyfriend, if he even had only one boyfriend. And whoever it was for, what was understood about the image, then, once it was received, once it had left the hospital’s apparently irresistible space and travelled elsewhere, into a different room, a different building entirely. The body translated and re-translated, then well used by somebody else. It was a favour, she guessed, that would have to be returned. Ian had held the phone above his head so carefully, lifted his chin precisely to the right, left room for the flat of his stomach, the bulge of his crotch, the landscape of his fist visible through the thin cotton. She could’ve counted the knuckles.
    
    Dr Duncan and Ian were not close, but at fifty-seven, her gender, the fact she was a woman surgeon, had meant interest in her life where there had been none before. It was a temperamental currency but she was happy to engage, to say yes when invited to speak, to nod in empathetic agreement that it must have been terribly hard.
    
    Ian’s fixation was Dr Duncan’s time in Strasbourg. She told him she’d been the only woman studying and specialising in laparoscopic procedures at the university there, although it wasn’t the truth. There had been at least two, no, three other women she could remember. She recalled his wide expression, her fingers on her St Christopher pendant as he listened, asked questions. The conversation had delighted him. He wanted to travel, he spoke to the history of laparoscopy, pointed out the obvious, that it was not one man that had invented, or even pioneered the concept, but a series of separate nineteenth-century surgeons who had all landed on the same thought, across different continents. When Ian said ‘man’ he added air quotations, not to doubt their maleness, she gathered, but to acknowledge the deficit. It was always the daring predictability of the human body that enamoured him, he’d added, wanting to impress her, that these ‘men’ would individually come to the same conclusion, that the appendix would be found at the end of the large intestine. Yes, she’d agreed. Suspended as a lone piece of grammar. He’d liked that.
    
    When it came to words, her ex-husband had been no good. Every thought of him she resisted, the eye of her memory half shut. There was one that broke through with irritating regularity. A fight, only medium-sized, and him with a small towel wrapped around his thickened waist. The sentences that left his mouth. He stood damp and stupid in the corner of their old bedroom. Hence, he shouted. Thus, therefore, ergo. Periphrastic, she should have accused.
    
    There was nothing left to sign. Thankfully no new emergency admissions that needed her. Dr Duncan locked her office door. Normally, she’d throw on jeans, boots, leave on her clean scrub top. Maybe a jumper. But this time she wanted a gentle difference, to look a little less like his mother. Her mascara was clumpy, old and barely used, but she applied it in persuasive strokes. Lipstick on, then removed, it was too much. There was, as it turned out, a line. Hair down, brushed, she sprayed through dry shampoo and hated, really hated, the sweet smell. She went to switch out her jewellery and then stopped.
    
    She sat back at her desk. There really was nothing in the room to look at. She didn’t know if the other surgeons, those with offices, bothered with pictures. Perhaps an ailing plant. Ian had stood there and seen nothing else of her. Only a torso, her face and neck. The St Christopher, which he already knew.
    
    She took out her phone. Typed gay porn into the search bar. Chose the first website, with its promise of FREE and SKILLED MOUTHS. She scrolled down the page, each video on offer played briefly, the highlights, she supposed, as her thumb slid over the screen. One after another. Volume up, then down. SEXY STUDS squatted on a blue carpet. An open car door, a man bent over another man’s lap, a third man in the passenger seat. Denim was unbuttoned, hard cocks revealed. No underwear, she noted. There was a state of readiness. A kiss with an apocalyptic urgency. In an empty gym, they knelt, sucked, eyes not closed but opened. Moved like winners. She had expected something else but didn’t know what.
    
    In the women’s bathroom she pumped pink soap into her hands. She leaned closer to the mirror. Decided she looked nice, the mascara was worth it. But the lipstick had not been properly removed, caught in the cracks. She rubbed her mouth with the back of her hand.
    
    A few bits of paperwork to sign and then she could leave. She walked out of the hospital, unlocked her car and sat in the driver’s seat. She always took exactly a minute, hands placed on the wheel, without turning on the engine. It wasn’t a ritual so much as a reckoning with the world, the one that existed separately to the hospital’s surging and specific reality. It was the light. Tonight, her vision smoky with fatigue, it was a navy blue, full of shadows and gaps, almost everything reduced to its simplest shape. There was a time, during her first months as a general surgeon, when she found it hard to reconcile, to decide which was truer, the hospital or the rest, whatever came after. Now she knew it didn’t matter. It was only the light. Her retinas adjusting, contracting.
    
    Alex had taken a similar flight last time, landing late. Once again she would be picking him up after a long shift. When she was younger she’d woken up to the sound of traffic cones hitting her bumper, having briefly fallen asleep at the wheel. She didn’t sleep well. Alex had been an insomniac toddler, in need of company. He’d quietly enter their bedroom, wake her up by placing his cold hands on her cheeks. For a few years, too many years maybe, she’d made up a single mattress for him on the floor beside her.
    
    She started the engine. Would skip the supermarket for tonight. There’d be a chance to go first thing, before he was up, breakfast would be ready before he’d even realised she had gone.
    
    It was expensive to park at the airport and so she’d instructed him to wait by the kerb. She spotted him easily. His lovely shoulders in a nice shirt, a new jacket, both black and stylish. She saw, too, that he was talking to somebody, laughing into his phone. He spotted her seconds later, waving, hanging up as he did so. She did not ask, once he’d settled into the passenger seat, who it had been and he did not offer the information either. An ellipsis strung between them. A slight and shifting tension, elbow to elbow.
    
    She asked ordinary questions.
    
    How was the flight, had he eaten, what were his plans, how was his course, did he have enough money?
    
    He answered fully. Kept his phone in his pocket. She heard
    it vibrate.
    
    They picked up a pizza. He was tired, happy to eat in front of the TV. Later, when he’d fallen asleep on the sofa, she picked it up and tried to guess his passcode. Not his birthday, not her birthday. He slept on, his lips pursed, the way he looked as a child, his hands slid down his trackpants to grip his knees. It was a decision as obvious as her tattoo. Not a sense of ownership but an impulse, fragile, that deserved to be acted on. There was no futurity, what she expected to find, and then what she might feel as a consequence. She’d tried his father’s birthday, not that either. There had been no pets in the family, no short and beloved names she could try and translate into the numeric. He stirred, repositioned his body. She stood beside him. The phone glowed in her hand.
    
    Alex’s screen saver was a pile of small, pinkish shells on a wooden surface, either a dining table or a windowsill. The image was zoomed in, his fingers dragged across the screen to enlarge what he’d noticed. It meant nothing to her. A shaft of light fell across the centre of the pile, turning those shells pinker. She supposed Alex had found the moment beautiful, enough that he wanted to look at it every day, every few minutes, however often he lifted his phone to his face.
    
    As if she had caught its scent, Dr Duncan thought of the second house she had bought with her ex-husband. It had been her favourite. A purchase made on certain romantic whims. The complication of wisteria, untended for decades, across the arched, single-glazed windows. A large pond in the back garden, supposedly made by seventeenth-century monks, surrounded by rare varieties of self-seeded mint that had once been planted in a kind of holy herb garden. Out the back of the house, over a wall, was a field, also theirs. At the closest end was a large, grassy mound. A burial cairn, empty after raids over the ensuing centuries, of which they were now the official guardians.
    
    Alex, too, had loved that house. He’d just turned nine. Together they bullied her ex-husband into taking it on. He was put off by old buildings, thanks to childhood summers spent in a great aunt’s collapsing cottage, where he’d placed a Bible beneath his pillow, believing it would ward off any evil as he slept.
    
    Alex made a brief friend at his new school. A boy with a laugh that came out of nowhere, it made her jump, leaving such quiet in its wake. For a month or so the boy would come over every other day, staying for dinner, the pair of them obsessed with treasure. Thrilled to find a small blue apothecary bottle beneath a floorboard, a possible arrowhead in the garden. Their archive collected on a kitchen windowsill, where it had stayed, even after the friendship had ended. Together they kneeled over portions of earth and dug ferociously. Celebrating, high-fiving, grabbing each other’s shoulders over broken bits of clay pipe, shards of pottery, shapely stones.
    
    That summer, from her bedroom window, she watched them poised on the mound, the burial cairn, lying on their stomachs, positioning and repositioning their shattered objects. Alex took on the boy’s laugh, getting louder, and they then laughed into each other, heavily, sides colliding. Reached across lower backs to move things this way and that. There was a secret formula, a pattern they wanted to achieve. They liked, if it was the weekend and could wait out the dusk, to turn over onto their backs and lie underneath the fading orange sunset. And she’d let them. n"

    "text": "There are times when I think of cutting my hair, times when I think of cutting my throat, and other times when I think of screwing out my eyes. Forgive me, Doctor, it’s just a way to talk about myself, and about Armance.

    A sense of perplexity comes over me, I no longer know what to say; that is, in general, when one suddenly falls silent, thought wanders as though in expectation and then there it is – a novelty or a reflection.
    
    I start thinking about all this on the train – since I know the landscape by heart it’s not hard to do. I always travel first class, and always sit by the window. I could just about be permanently lost in thought, given the frequency of my displacements.
    
    I also have a habit of sitting on a rock by the river to read Stendhal or look at the river and the stones.
    
    I have absolutely no parents, no friends in particular, my life runs serenely, sweetly.
    
    A young woman has been living in my house for some time and I often meet acquaintances of hers to whom I offer drinks in my beautiful glasses. Miss Armance is very good company, she was born twenty years before me and wears her hair back, always neat. We met on the Milan–Gotthard–Zurich direttissimo train of the Swiss Federal Railways.
    
    She was sitting almost directly in front of me and one noticed her right away on account of that strict look she has at all times; now that I know it, I hardly notice it anymore, except on rare occasions; though there was a time when I couldn’t help going to her room at odd hours of the night, to see whether she might have let herself go a little (or not at all), to hear a story, or to be caressed.
    
    And she was so strict, so frightfully fierce. In the train compartment she had looked at me in such a mean way, and kept doing so. And so I took up my newspaper trick, I pretended to read, to look out the window in which her face was reflected, I smoked, blew my nose, picked up a book, looked up, and she was no longer there.
    
    Naturally I thought once again, with a sigh of relief, that I have too much imagination. I don’t think much of the very silly, even gullible, person that I am. But one starts to conjecture right away through the entire length of the Gotthard Tunnel – about ten minutes.
    
    She wears a kind of scarf I like very much – reddish, wide and comfortable – with a well-cut suit. Has it ever happened to you while on a train or a streetcar, or while riding a taxi, that you catch sight of someone you’d like to meet right away, just like that, or when you’re at a cafe, looking around, just so, I’d like to emphasize, for no particular reason?
    
    I remember once, on my way to Lindau, on the Bodensee, a thin tall man with gray eyes came into my compartment, I was a young girl on my way to school and was reading a book in French that I didn’t understand. The man started talking to me, asking whether I understood that book, and it struck me – how experienced he was.
    
    Then came the station, and I went back to school, crestfallen. Several years have gone by and I still think about it, like a wolf. I wouldn’t hide my desire to see him again (and to devour him).
    
    Often when I look at swallows in flight I wish I could fly: I love the sky, I look at the clouds and have no taste for extravagance. Lately I’d heard a girl ten years younger than me recount her dreams, about hens and metamorphoses. Not that the dreams of others particularly intrigue me, but I can become perplexed at the majesty of certain dreams I’ve never dreamed. As soon as Armance bid me goodnight, I would wait until she had fallen asleep to find out what might happen to her; I go into her room and watch; every now and then she moves her lips, or becomes agitated, I start to hum, finding it absurd to see one person asleep and another one standing there.
    
    I can never sleep in her bed, I absolutely detest getting tangled up.
    
    Armance starts telling her tale again. She is slipping into a sea of lizards and experiences a frightful tickling in her feet. I immediately feel pins and needles in my feet and I’m awake. Oh well. Could I ever understand my Armance?
    
    Out of coquetry, or a desire to compare, I look at myself in the mirror and I am decidedly determined to become more graceful, desirable, I spread sea-light pale blue eyeshadow on my lids and brush my hair a hundred times each day.
    
    I remember a dwarf playing in the sand in Camargue with a friend, I would have liked to have been an angel, to run after them, suffocate them, then turn into a mole.
    
    I detest Armance’s friends, I can’t stand them, I keep looking at my watch and they seem to never go away, and besides I’m not having a good time, and it seems ridiculous that I should have to wait for nightfall to have a conversation with her. I’m sure that in a few minutes she’ll smile at me simply because she is a bitch, and in one moment precisely everyone will smile at me; naturally I act as though nothing happened, maybe I’ve never been perfectly happy, but I know one shouldn’t be too patient.
    
    I don’t wish to put anyone on guard, but careful. Arousing is not allowed.
    
    Because then I can’t fall asleep. And what happens next is that since I am not sleeping I start thinking, scrutinizing my feelings, I go back to Armance, don’t say a word to her, adore her, go back to my room, drink a glass of milk and fall asleep again.
    
    I wake up in the morning and ask to be taken to the beach, it’s hot, I drink white wine and we’re especially cheerful. Everyone’s drinking, it’s like a picnic, we’re all friends, I no longer need to plot anything.
    
    How do I know whether I like the sea, how could I imagine that Armance can’t swim? And that all you need is a slip and you fall off a cliff ? Let’s rejoice.
    
    Go without taking offense, so that I might go back to sleep and watch over Armance as she sleeps.
    
    It’s raining, raining hard and I don’t think the weather will clear.
    
    . . . ‘The first thing is to understand whether a person’s openness might be a positive sign with respect to another person.’ This is a problem I have in love.
    
    Everyone has their moment. I don’t know what to do with this rainy afternoon. It gets the time it deserves.
    
    The calendar. There are many calendars in my house. Miss Armance has been living in the other room for months. Gazing at the calendars I see a kind of balance sheet, a summary, no way out. On the 3rd of June I could have hit her I was so furious. Categorically. It’s a good thing I make a note of everything, otherwise she’d be right all the time. I don’t have a comeback all lined up, and don’t immediately realize what is going on, I mean that all you’d need is a distraction and I just know that these so-called friends would become – what? Brothers, maybe something more, lovers perhaps, Armance my dear, and all the while I bite my nails.
    
    And today, a Tuesday, is another afternoon like the one before it. If they steal I devour, I’m alive and well, so why does Armance go on torturing me, and if she pretends to be as I want her, why doesn’t she take her so-called friends to tea at Babington’s or elsewhere, for instance? She’d come back at dusk more beautiful than ever.
    
    The calendar says that from November of last year to today I have spent only one afternoon at home. Brooding.
    
    My solitary afternoons, the movie theaters, the aimless taxi rides, what a nightmare when we won’t be allowed to smoke in taxis anymore, Armance, what will I do with my life then? And what of my afternoons?
    
    One afternoon I picked scented roses from a vine, with all their little green leaves, and the petals so pale blue blown in the breeze, which is what happens when I look at the sky, with tears in my eyes I put down my Rozenkrantz."

    "text": "Your girlfriend is some kind of sexual deviant, but it is not as much fun as you first thought.

    You’re that one lad in your year who grew about four inches between the last day of spring term and the first day of autumn term. Ever since, the girls at school can’t get enough of you. Again, you thought this would be more fun than it actually turned out to be.
    
    They come and sit next to you when you just want to eat your sandwiches in the courtyard in peace, listen to music and think about your favourite WWE wrestlers. Suddenly one of them will yank your earphone out and say through a mouthful of chewing gum, Watcha listening to, handsome? Or a girl will kiss you on one of your premature sideburns and you’ll be dimly aware of her saliva for the rest of the day. It’s nothing to do with you; they are just programmed to like tall men. Something to do with the caveman times, and who can slay the biggest wild pig. You’re starting to notice that everything in the world boils down to meat, blood and bones – evolution is all on the surface. The truth is, despite appearances, you’d rather be killed than kill. Your mate Dave said if you picked one of them to go out with, the rest might leave you alone.
    
    Your girlfriend isn’t like other girls, which is why you asked her to go out with you in the first place, when you freed her 20p from the vending machine in the dinner hall, and she turned her watery eyes towards you and looked at you like a brain-damaged bird. That’s what you thought of: a baby bird you’d once seen dying in a splat on the ground after presumably falling out of its nest. Huge, wet eyeballs, and its chest rising raggedly, up, down, up, down. You knew you should’ve done something but you left it there. It was a hot sunny day and some parts of it – the bones in its neck, the tips of its wings – were already drying out, turning plasticky. You figured it wouldn’t be long until nature took its course, or for somebody braver than you to come along and drop a brick on its head.
    
    In front of the vending machine, your future girlfriend held out her beaded purse. You dropped the silver coin in, and she zipped it closed and put it in her satchel without thanking you. Everyone at school carries a rucksack: Nike, Adidas, Rip Curl; decorated with pin badges and Tipp-Ex expletives. Yours is Animal and covered in cool S’s. She had a brown leather messenger that closed with a flap and a magnet. Not a spot of graffiti.
    
    Do you want to get some chips or something after school? You said it too quickly. It wasn’t like you to be shy. She just shrugged. Her expression hadn’t altered throughout the exchange, and you found that oddly charming. It was boring always knowing what people were thinking; it was annoying. You couldn’t imagine this girl chewing your ear off, laughing like a hyena, flirting with your mates. It was as if you’d discovered a new land or species, and now all you had to do was stick your flag in it before somebody else noticed. By rights you were out of her league, but you didn’t know until you saw her waiting under the cherry tree by the gates whether her shrug had meant yes or no. You guessed that gave her back some power.
    
    It was the unbranded chicken shop where everyone went on dates. It was the cheapest place in town. The strip lights flickered and the ketchup was watered down with vinegar. Sometimes the chicken was still frozen in the middle. You bought her chips and she surprised you by eating them very fast. You were too nervous to be hungry. Besides, it was a Thursday and you didn’t want to spoil your mum’s meatballs. You pushed your chips towards her, and she ate those too.
    
    I should warn you, she said, ketchup on her chin, on the back of her hand. I like to have sex a lot. It was the first proper thing she’d said to you. You slid some napkins over which she ignored. You asked her if she wanted ice cream, and she shrugged, which you were learning to take as consent. You bought her a strawberry dream: three shades of pink layered in a plastic vase.
    
    I like to do it in uncomfortable places, she said, cream running down her forearm.
    
    If there’s a patch of slimy mud or some coarse gravel or some freshly fallen snow, and nobody’s around, your girlfriend is going to take off her panties and lie in it. Her skin is like British Museum marble, and she’s got this incredibly pink pussy that always looks sore. You were fascinated by it at first, but now watching yourself go in and out of it turns your stomach, like seeing a shoe rub a blister.
    
    Your girlfriend has long red hair and maybe this is why you thought she was attractive. Red hair is like a trick played on lads’ minds. Sometimes you wonder if she’d be pretty at all if she shaved her head. The hair on her pussy is ginger and her eyelashes are very pale. If you asked her to shave her head she would. Her obedience frightens you, and you’re increasingly careful not to ask for anything.
    
    At first, doing it with her was satisfying, if a little strange. Lately, she’s not letting you finish. It’s like she reaches a point of maximum discomfort, and therefore satisfaction, and then gets up and starts getting dressed, leaving you there flailing. Come on, she says. And you follow her home with it tucked into your waistband, waiting for the moment you can lock yourself in your parents’ downstairs loo and finish the job over the bowl. Your girlfriend is turning you into a deviant, and it isn’t even your fault.
    
    All you really want to do is fuck her in a bed. Take your time; look at her instead of over your shoulder. Catch your breath and decide if you even like her. She lives in a caravan with her step-dad: in her bedroom with the door closed and music playing, you can still hear her dad opening lagers in the lounge and coughing. Your parents are religious, which means when your girlfriend is over you have to leave the door wide open. You have had sex with your girlfriend 114 times so far, and not once did you have it in your own bed. Not once did you feel safe and unhurried.
    
    I’m getting into strangulation, she tells you one afternoon over chips. Her ceaseless list of fetishes distracts from the distracted way you have to be with her. Your time together is always just beginning or about to end. I like the feeling that at any moment I might die, she says. Here, you try. She stretches over the table and blindsides you by putting her hands around your neck. She is stronger than she looks, much stronger. You choke and make a girlish sound. You can feel half-chewed chips climbing your oesophagus. You knock over your Coke, panicking. The family in the next booth are craning. With your larger hands you snatch at her bony fingers.
    
    You should’ve said if you didn’t like it, she says.
    
    She has retracted back to her side of the booth, and slumps over her chips. Your crotch is soaked with Coke; you know you should be angry but you’re not. She chews with her mouth open, not taking her eyes off you; walks her fingers up to your cup of barbeque sauce.
    
     
    
    One of the things your mother says is to always have a plan. You plan to build a bed of nails and fuck your girlfriend on it. Your girlfriend doesn’t make you happy, exactly, and you have very little in common. She isn’t interested in wrestling. But lately you’ve spent so much time together it’s getting difficult to remember what you did before. There’s an intensity to the way you are with her that you’re afraid you won’t find anywhere else – something between fear and protectiveness; excitement and shame. Perhaps your bed of nails will cure her deviancy, like Miss Jameson says prayer will cure the homos. It will be a grand gesture designed to bring you closer. You’ll tend her wounds. You’ll find a different way to be with one another. Perhaps she’ll swear chastity and you’ll gallantly join her, pretending to mind, secretly not minding. You’re tired of feeling dirty. The lads at school buy their girlfriends miniature teddy bears with plush red hearts over their bellies. The same lads call the girls sluts and make them cry on purpose. The girls attach the teddy bears to the zippers of their school bags, like proof of something. The only thing you can be sure of is that cuddly toys aren’t reflective of whatever it is you have with your girlfriend. You’ll make a bed of nails, because your girlfriend proclaims to love pain, and it’s about time you gave her something real.
    
    Miss Allingham-Mills is excited by your bed of nails proposal and says not enough young people are interested in meditation these days. She wants you to make a Design Folder charting your project from conception to completion, highlighting any pitfalls along the way and offering suggestions on how they could be avoided if you were to undertake the project a second time. You say you only want to make a bed of nails, not go on and on about making it. She wishes you luck in finding another fully stocked workshop. You make the folder.
    
    Your girlfriend comes to watch you work at lunchtimes and after school. One evening, walking her home across the fields, you find a rabbit lying on its side under a hedgerow. Its eyes are swollen to double the normal size. Flies hover. You think it’s dead, then one of its legs starts to jerk. Ergh, you say. Come on. She shakes your hand off. It’s mixy, she says. We have to find a rock. You look around until you find a big enough rock and she says, Ready? You say yes, but soon realise you can’t do it. Fine, she says. She takes the rock and you turn your back. You will never forget the sound.
    
    It turns out that a bed of nails is a very easy thing to make. You could probably have done it in a day or two, if you didn’t have to do it around your other lessons. After a week, the nails are in place, though they are all wobbly in their holes. You need to put more screws in to get some pressure, says your girlfriend, swinging her legs from one of the work benches. You tell her you know that already. Just fill in the folder, you say. What do you want me to write? she says. Anything, you say.
    
    Miss Allingham-Mills tests the tension in the nails by pinging them at random with her fingers. They make a twanging sound. Nice finish, she says, stroking its smooth edges. How about showing it in assembly? She asks to see your folder and your girlfriend hands it over. Miss Allingham-Mills flicks through it, nodding and hmm-hemming, apparently satisfied.
    
    The night you finish it, you have a dream that an animal is sitting on your chest – its breath is sweet and rank like junk food. You wake up fighting for breath, your heart hammering, and realise you have orgasmed in your sleep.
    
     
    
    A bed of nails isn’t especially heavy but it is an awkward thing to carry. You didn’t think this far ahead. You ask Dave to help you carry it along the old tramway to the bridge where you’ve been a couple of times already with your girlfriend. He says he will do it for a Mars bar and a look at your girlfriend’s tits. You ask her and she shrugs. You buy a Mars bar from the vending machine where you first met her. Dog walkers pretend not to stare as you and Dave pass with the bed of nails. You have secured two leather straps to help carry it. Walking behind, your girlfriend pets the dogs. At no point does she offer to help.
    
    The path continues over the bridge, while a smaller track forks off, leading to the water. You tell Dave it’s just down this way. He insists you are the one to walk backwards down the slippery mud. As you’re the one getting laid, he says. Fair enough, you say. You huff and skid and swear, tread carefully as you can. You focus on your girlfriend waiting on the main path to try to incentivise yourself. You do not feel remotely horny.
    
    Timber! says Dave, and the bed of nails smacks into the mud under the bridge, splattering you both. There is graffiti on the domed ceiling. There is some white dog shit in the far corner. This is the closest you’ve ever got to fucking your girlfriend indoors. Go on, then, says Dave. And you give him the Mars bar. And the rest, he says. You call your girlfriend down and a moment later she appears, with the light and the water behind her. Her hair burns like sodium in the last of the day’s sun.
    
    Go on, says Dave.
    
    Your girlfriend looks at you. You shrug.
    
    She turns her face to the side and down, as though something in the mud of the riverbank has caught her eye, and lifts up her T-shirt and fleece in one.
    
     
    
    It is less than an hour later and you and Dave are walking back along the old tramway and both of your backs are bleeding, 200 tiny holes. Dave takes out his Mars bar and opens the wrapper, and drops the wrapper on the ground. You walk in silence. Everything hurts. You put your hand up your sweater and wince when you feel the damage. Your hand comes away bloody. A dog walker passes, going in the direction of the bridge and says, Good evening. You both say, Good evening. And then your friend takes a ragged sob.
    
    Do you want this, Dave says. You tell him you don’t especially like Mars bars, but you’ll have it if it’s going free. Have it, he says, and gives it to you. When you reach the car park, you feel sick. All you can taste is chocolate. All you can feel is a wet, unhygienic pain.
    
    I’m going this way, says Dave. Though of course you know where he lives.
    
     
    
    You’re not really sure how it happened but your girlfriend told you to lie on the bed of nails and you found you wanted to. What’s my name, she said, pulling your jeans off while Dave stood frozen against the wall, a smirk dying on his lips. Elenore, you said. What’s my fucking name, she said. Elenore! A dozen birds erupted from a nearby blackthorn. Say my name say my say it say it. Elenore! You were crying. Elenore! You were bleeding. Elenore, Elenore. You were so in love.
    
     
    
    You look back at where Dave has disappeared. He broke much sooner than you, and you hope he’s okay, though if you’re honest, you don’t care very much. He didn’t have to be such a pussy. You had planned on walking home yourself. Everything is suddenly so new, so confusing. You thought you needed to be alone for a while. To look at yourself long and hard in the bathroom mirror. But you surprise yourself by turning around. Hello again, says the same dog walker from earlier, returning to her car. A bag of shit swings merrily from her belt. The dog is leashed now, so close to the road.
    
    I left something, you tell her.
    
    You’d better run, says the dog walker. It’ll be pitch dark soon enough."

    "text": "Hal had a bad shoulder. Danna had no patience for it. She felt Hal was selective about what the shoulder could take. They could fuck in whatever position, he could carry her bags at the airport, but if Danna wanted to book a duo Pilates session ever, Hal was in agony. He often said it like that: I’m in agony. Hal and Danna were sitting on a restaurant patio, eating cheeses. Hal had the ball game up on his phone. In the morning, they’d leave on a short vacation in celebration of Danna’s birthday; the night before a vacation, they never ate
    at home.
    
    Hal was moving his right shoulder in circles: forward, backward, forward. When he did his shoulder exercises his face always became vacant, upsettingly so.
    
    ‘Who’s winning?’ Danna asked.
    
    ‘Not us,’ said Hal. He rolled his shoulder harder. ‘Jesus Christ,’ he said. ‘Fuck.’ He made a disgusting noise of relief and rubbed his right shoulder with his left hand.
    
    Hal had no shame about pain. He’d grown up loved. Danna had been loved too, but by parents who were doctors. There’d been no room for pain in Danna’s house; her parents were amputating feet and resecting bowels. The only person who’d ever cared to hear about Danna’s pain was Hal. It was what made her love him right away: how seriously he took everything about her. When Danna had a headache Hal brought out his special headache hat, an ice pack in the shape of a crown. When Danna had strep, Hal shone a flashlight in her mouth to look at her tonsils twice a day and gave her creative descriptions of how they looked. The left one looks like a striped candy. The right one looks like a blobfish.
    
    Hal held his silverware in the European style because his mother had grown up holding it that way. He could flex his butt cheeks independently of one another, on command. He’d published a chapbook straight out of grad school about an empty field and time passing and dedicated it to Danna. Danna had intrusive thoughts sometimes about Hal getting crushed by the train or stabbed by a bum on the train or stabbed by Danna herself in the middle of the night while she sleepwalked, which she’d never done, but which she always feared she might spontaneously start doing. The thoughts made her very sad most of the time. But sometimes when she had them she didn’t feel anything at all, and she wondered what she’d feel if Hal died for real. Sometimes she thought nothing. She wondered if that meant she didn’t love him. She wondered if that meant she shouldn’t marry him. She wondered if anyone should marry anyone. She wondered if she’d have these thoughts if she were marrying someone very rich. She wondered if she’d have these thoughts if she were marrying someone who wasn’t very rich but who wasn’t Hal. Eight years in, Hal felt like another her, somehow. She knew his body better than her own, she loved how silky he was, she could tell by the hitch of his voice exactly what he was thinking and exactly why he was thinking it, she could watch him struggle with a jar and know whether he would be able to get it open, she could tell by the way he headed toward the bathroom whether he was going in to shit or trim his nails, she could tell from how he looked at his phone who he was texting. She could trace his behaviors and failures and strengths to the behaviors and failures and strengths of his parents and of his brothers. She could make the worst and thickest noise when she orgasmed and feel safe in the certainty he’d love it. When he couldn’t penetrate her, which was often, because Danna had a tight pelvic floor, she knew exactly the sorts of phrases to whisper in his ear while he jerked himself off with one hand and cupped his own balls with the other, the order to say them in, which ones to repeat, which one to save for last, which one would make Hal get that sad look in his eyes that meant he was about to bust. She felt liable for him. She had the capacity to hate him. She had the need to manage him, protect him. She and Hal cared for each other. They popped each other’s pimples. They fingered one another’s assholes. They did each other’s dishes. And so, they’d recently decided, they would become engaged to be married at the end of the summer.
    
    Danna’s great dream was to commit double suicide with Hal at sixty-five so that neither of them would ever have to endure the humiliations of old age. Danna’s mother had had a pair of patients who’d done just that about five years ago, walking into a canal together with rocks in their pockets. They were elderly communists and they’d had enough. When Danna imagined herself and Hal as old communists who’d had enough, walking together into death, it felt realer to her than the present. For this reason Danna wondered if maybe what she really wanted was just to die.
    
    Now Danna’s mother was texting. Have fun. I am very happy for you.
    
    Danna blinked at the text. ‘Um,’ she said out loud, ‘why does my mom think we’re getting engaged this weekend?’
    
    Hal didn’t answer her. He had his hand over his mouth: that meant Brandon Marsh was at bat. Danna knew better than to press him. She went on the website of the jeweler who was making her ring and looked at the piece that would be ready for her in nine to twelve weeks: sometime in August. It was a gold band, channel-set with small squares of lapis lazuli. It wasn’t one of a kind. Probably several other girls had it. Danna hoped that in a year she’d still think it was chic. It was what Hal could afford. Danna had never dreamed of an engagement ring; she’d dreamed of being someone’s favorite. The ring proved that she was Hal’s.
    
    ‘Because we leave tomorrow? Or because they’re fascists,’ Hal said, after a time. ‘Fascists without a dream in their heart.’ Danna ignored it when Hal deployed these kinds of non sequiturs; they were an affectation he’d shaped for the purpose of getting attention from his father – a radical who hated children, a deadly serious writer of dense, unpopular novels. Hal had had to say things like They’re fascists, fascists without a dream in their heart from the time he was a child, probably, just to get his father’s head out of the London Review of Books. To Danna, understanding the roots of someone’s tics or pains better than they understood them themselves was the purest love could get.
    
    ‘Ah,’ said Hal. Marsh was out. Danna handed him a piece of cheese and he ate it without looking at her.
    
    ‘It’s just ball,’ they said at the same time; it was what they said when something was wrong.
    
     
    
    Hal drove. Danna texted and listened to lo-fi beats and watched Instagram stories and checked the weather and looked at photos from May 2018 and November 2017 and searched StreetEasy for one-bedrooms under $3,500 in Fort Greene Park Slope Crown Heights Prospect Heights Gowanus Williamsburg Greenpoint Carroll Gardens Columbia Waterfront District Brooklyn Heights Clinton Hill Windsor Terrace Prospect Lefferts Gardens and checked the stock market and opened TikTok and watched a TikTok of a dog licking a baby’s head and one of a woman talking about being diagnosed with stage four cancer while pregnant and one of a woman showing off her collection of Chanel ballet flats and one of a man adding jam to yogurt to make a high-protein dessert and one of a baby allegedly seeing a ghost and one of a nonbinary relationship advice expert who was saying that the thing women are looking for in a relationship is a man who will fight for them and then Danna closed TikTok and took a picture of the highway and uploaded it to Close Friends and checked Slack and looked on Depop and read all of the notes in her notes app and googled can you buy car over 100k miles reddit and opened Maps and zoomed all the way out and scrolled to Russia and zoomed in on parts of Russia and thought about vastness and Stalingrad and goats by the roadside and coldness and fur hats and how society had been constructed and how race had been constructed and how borders had been constructed and about one of her beautiful acting-school classmates from Kyrgyzstan and about visiting Kyrgyzstan, and then she googled visit kyrgistan american legal and americans visit tibet legal and paused the music and opened TikTok once more and watched a TikTok of a Tibetan girl that popped up first thing and a video of a Kyrgyz girl that popped up second thing, which made her think about her Kyrgyz classmate’s eating disorder, which made her think about her own eating disorder, and her mother’s eating disorder, at which point she began to feel huge in her body, so she went back to looking at apartments and requested a tour of an apartment on Lincoln Place for Tuesday, when they’d be back, and then she rested her head against the window, breathed in heavily twice, thought hazily about the Lincoln Place apartment’s wide wood floorboards – so much wider than the floorboards in their current place – and fell asleep to the dream of them.
    
    ‘Danna,’ Hal said in his emergency voice, ‘Danna,’ rousing her.
    
    Her stomach squeezed in on itself. Her arms went numb. She braced for whatever.
    
    ‘Am I getting off here,’ Hal asked, frantic, ‘or am I going straight?’
    
    ‘I’m asleep,’ Danna said. Her ears hurt. Her big headphones were still on. She lifted the right earpad and placed it behind her right ear. She looked through the windshield. They were veering right, toward the exit. ‘I don’t know, I don’t know, I think –’
    
    ‘Fuck,’ Hal said, whipping his neck left. ‘Fuck.’ He pulled the wheel hard. Then they were on the grassy triangle between the exit and the highway.
    
    ‘Ahh,’ Danna said. ‘Jesus fuck.’
    
    They were stopped just in front of a murder of sturdy orange barricades, little cylinders bunched together like kindergarteners. The car lilted to the left. They were upstate-ish; there were hills.
    
    ‘Fuck,’ Hal said again, and tried to merge back on to the road.
    
    ‘Stop,’ Danna said, ‘stop, is the car okay?’ It was a rental; she had a sudden vision of being taken to court and squeezed for everything she had.
    
    ‘Nothing happened,’ Hal said. ‘We’re just on this part.’
    
    ‘Something happened,’ Danna said. ‘You’re not on the road.’
    
    ‘This is the road,’ Hal said.
    
    ‘It’s not the road,’ Danna said. ‘It’s the triangle. Stop. Stop moving. Put it in park. Put it in park.’
    
    Hal wouldn’t put the car in park. Danna pulled up on the emergency brake.
    
    ‘You’re, like, freaking out,’ Hal said, shifting furiously into park.
    
    ‘You drove off the road,’ Danna said.
    
    ‘Because I didn’t know where to go. You were supposed to be on Maps.’
    
    ‘Stop gaslighting me,’ Danna said. ‘This is serious.’
    
    ‘This isn’t serious. I just need to know which way.’
    
    Suddenly Danna’s head was vibrating. Her fancy German headphones were letting her know she was getting a call. ‘Mommy,’ said the lady who was the automated voice of Danna’s headphones. ‘Mommy.’ This was what the headphones said when Danna’s mother was calling. Danna declined the call.
    
    ‘Hold on,’ she said to Hal. She looked at Maps. ‘It says go straight.’ Danna looked up and ahead. ‘It’s a toll road here.’
    
    ‘I know,’ Hal said. ‘Which is why I got confused. We didn’t rent the – the thing, the whatever –’
    
    ‘What thing –’
    
    ‘The pass, the special pass that beeps. For tolls.’
    
    ‘They can bill by plate,’ Danna said. ‘There’s a whole bill-by-plate lane,’ she said, pointing to it, ‘right there.’
    
    Hal followed her point, but he was making the face he made when he didn’t want to have things clarified or simplified, when he wanted to be confused, when he wanted to shame Danna with his confusion. ‘Where?’ he asked, squinting.
    
    ‘The – the far lane, there,’ Danna said. She pointed harder.
    
    ‘Fine,’ Hal said, pissed. He looked over his shoulder, disengaged the emergency brake and put the car in drive. He hung a hard left and floored the gas. The car rocketed across all four lanes. Lots of people honked.
    
    ‘HAL,’ said Danna, grabbing at the wheel, yanking it toward her, stopping Hal from smashing into one of the toll booths. Hal braked. A worker inside looked up like: Whoa.
    
    ‘Do you need to get out?’ Danna asked. ‘Do you need to get out and let me drive?’
    
    ‘I’m a good driver,’ Hal said.
    
    ‘So why is this happening, why are we doing this? You need to calm the fuck down. Take a fucking breath, dude.’
    
    ‘Don’t call me dude,’ Hal said. ‘I hate it when you call me dude.’ He took a breath. Hal was good at parallel parking and little else when it came to cars.
    
    ‘Let’s switch,’ Danna said, unbuckling. ‘We need to switch for a little.’
    
    ‘There’s cars,’ Hal said.
    
    ‘We need to switch,’ Danna said, and they did. Then she guided them through the toll booth and onward, toward the place they were paying money to visit.
    
     
    
    The resort was not as nice as it had seemed online. Nothing ever was. Danna should’ve known better than to expect real comfort; she’d first seen it on TikTok. There was a small woodstove in the cabin, a laminated card on a table nearby that said i work. Danna dreamed for a second that later they’d gather some firewood together and get cozy, maybe trade lazy oral on the floor before it.
    
    ‘Fuck, my eyes,’ Hal said, taking off his glasses to paw at his lids. ‘They’re so dry.’
    
    Danna’s phone buzzed. Giada – her oldest, simplest friend.
    
    I SAW STORIES
    ARE YOU THERE NOW
    RING PIC IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS IT HAPPENS IM DEADASS
    IS THERE CHAMPS IN ROOM
    OR FRUIT
    ?????????
    
    There were some photogenic mandarins, stems attached, on a low table near the woodstove – Danna squeezed them, testing for realness.
    
    Hal looked at the mandarins. ‘Aww,’ he said. ‘I love when they have the stems.’ He took a picture of Danna’s hand around the fruit, and Danna could tell by the way he moved his thumbs that he was tagging and posting.
    
    thers fruit, she wrote Giada, but its complimentary
    like he didn’t put it there
    ***theres
    
    ‘You didn’t order these, right?’ she asked Hal, double-checking.
    
    Hal made a face that indicated he hadn’t. Danna’s ribs crackled; she felt rageful, out of nowhere. She never would’ve thought to want special hotel fruit. But now that there was fruit, and not because of Hal but because it was always here for everyone, she felt unspecial.
    
    Giada texted a screenshot of Hal’s story of the mandarins, then three messages:
    
    IS HE PROPOSING OR DID HE JUST TAKE U TO THE CATSKILLS FOR BDAY
    IS HE PROPOSING OR DID HE JUST ORDER THE MOST AESTHETIC FRUIT FOR U
    BLEEEEEEBS
    
    Bleebs was what Giada said when she was feeling excited.
    
    ‘Is the ring secretly ready?’ Danna asked Hal. ‘Do you, like: secretly have the ring right now?’
    
    Hal looked frightened. ‘No,’ he said. ‘You’re on the emails with them too. You’d know.’
    
    Danna had wanted a full-transparency proposal. No surprises. No pictures. She would not make the engagement face. She would not put her hands over her mouth. She and Hal would go to the store and pick up the ring, and they would walk to the waterfront, and he’d put it on her finger, and they’d walk home slowly, talking as they often did on walks about how much they loved one another, and nothing about their relationship would be different. But now Danna felt a lack.
    
    Hal could see it in her face, apparently. ‘Is your mom bugging you about this? Is your mom making you feel like you should be engaged to me already when she doesn’t even want you to be engaged to me? Like I’m a dick for not proposing on your birthday when you told me you didn’t want me to propose on your birthday? Because your birthday was about your birthday and our relationship was about our relationship?’
    
    ‘Stop shitting on my mom,’ Danna said. ‘It’s Giada.’
    
    ‘Stop texting with Giada.’
    
    ‘You’re being really scary today.’
    
    ‘Oh, my God,’ Hal said. He put his hands in his hair. ‘We need to, like: I don’t know, dude, hit reset.’
    
    ‘You can’t call me dude if I can’t call you dude.’
    
    ‘Oh, my –’
    
    ‘You got so mad at me for calling you dude in the car. Like, so mad.’
    
    ‘I wasn’t so mad. I’m not mad. I haven’t been mad. I’m never mad at you, because you are the light of my fucking life.’
    
    ‘Shut the fuck up,’ Danna said, feeling crushed by love.
    
    ‘Don’t say fuck just because I said fuck,’ Hal said.
    
    In minutes they were kissing. Sometimes they got their wires all – it was stupid. Why was it so hard for them to hear each other? Sometimes it felt like they’d never met before.
    
    ‘Do you sometimes feel like you’ve never met me before?’ she asked him, breaking the kiss. He tried not to let her. ‘Do you ever feel like we don’t know each other and we’re strangers?’
    
    ‘No,’ Hal said, so simple. ‘Do you?’
    
    ‘I don’t know,’ Danna said. ‘I think it’s the driving.’
    
    ‘I made one fucking mistake. Because you weren’t navigating. Because you fell asleep. And I’d never begrudge you sleep. But I asked you to navigate.’
    
    Danna knew Hal was right. Only babies could get away with falling asleep anywhere. ‘Two mistakes, right next to each other. Two bad mistakes.’
    
    ‘Nothing bad happened.’
    
    But she felt like something bad had happened, even though it was, to be fair, objectively true that nothing had. In moments like this one Danna felt like something was growing out of her brain. Like she’d never know a moment of surety, or quiet. The might’ves were always branching, branching, carrying ugly blooms: the fear of missing something obvious, the fear of everyone but Danna knowing some great truth about what her life really was.
    
     
    
    Early the next morning Danna dreamed that she was one of two finalists for a prestigious magazine job. Then the other finalist died and Danna got the job by default. She woke up feeling so boundless and powerful that she suggested a hike; there was a four-mile loop that started behind the resort, and though Danna was not an outdoorswoman, she’d inferred from the Instagrams of others that shared experiences in nature could deepen the connection between two people in an exponential way.
    
    ‘Great,’ said Hal, ‘lemme shower.’
    
    ‘But we’re going on a hike,’ Danna said.
    
    Hal looked around as if at an audience. ‘So I can’t shower?’
    
    ‘No, it’s just: why would you? If you’re gonna get sweaty?’
    
    ‘I don’t get that sweaty walking,’ said Hal. ‘That’s you.’
    
    While Hal showered, Danna dressed and applied SPF to her face, her vulva already sweating through her lululemon tights. ‘You’re making it so hot in here,’ she screamed through the frosted glass of the sliding door to the bathroom, but Hal didn’t respond. He emerged from the bathroom as he always did after a shower, fully dressed; Danna was dismayed to find that he was wearing chinos and a button-down. ‘We’re going on a hike,’ she said.
    
    ‘I didn’t bring hike clothes,’ said Hal.
    
    ‘We’re dressed for totally different things.’
    
    ‘So?’
    
    ‘So I want it to be an athletic walk.’
    
    ‘It’ll be an athletic walk.’
    
    ‘I want to get sweaty, though.’
    
    Hal looked at her.
    
    ‘And when we’re dressed differently for the same thing it makes us both look retarded in completely different ways. Like: when I’m dressing for an athletic walk and you’re dressing for a casual walk, it’s like I’m alone in the pursuit of an athletic walk, and it’s like you don’t really want to be on the walk with me in the way I want to be on the walk.’
    
    ‘I want to be on the walk,’ Hal said. ‘In whatever way you want to be on a walk. I literally forgot the clothes. I wish I could be in the right clothes. I’m sorry.’
    
    ‘Thank you,’ Danna said.
    
    ‘But don’t say retarded, Danna,’ Hal said. ‘It doesn’t make you sound cool.’
    
    The hike was simple and beautiful, but Hal seemed to have decided that he wanted to use it to make a point to Danna about her self-absorption. Each time they passed anyone on the trail, a few minutes later Hal would go, ‘Do you remember what they were wearing?’ and Danna would have to admit she didn’t and Hal would poke her shoulder and Danna would tell him to fuck off. Things grew tense and, at a certain point, when they heard someone around the next bend, Danna looked at Hal and said, ‘Don’t you fucking dare ask me what they’re wearing,’ but when the path straightened out on the far side of a deep curve there weren’t people there at all. A mother bear with three cubs was crossing the trail many yards ahead of them, one cub swiftly climbing into the brush on the trail’s western side while the other two stopped in the middle to play, like dogs, pawing and biting. The mother bear turned her head. Danna made eye contact with her, and she felt the quality and the length of their eye contact to be profound. Then the bear turned back to her cubs, urging them along. The babies walked into the yellowing brush, and their mother followed behind.
    
    Hal smiled at Danna and squeezed her hand. He didn’t say a word, and neither did she. They walked forward: cautious, linked, studying the animals’ prints in the dirt.
    
    After the bears, Danna started noticing the smells around her more intensely, and Hal started periodically going ‘Ah, Jesus’, and reaching up beneath his sunglasses to wipe tears from his eyes, and both of them became more vocal about pointing out flowers and leaves they liked to one another.
    
    At the rough midpoint of the loop they stopped to sit on some large rocks and kiss and look at their phones and share some water from Hal’s water bottle, and Danna thought about what a perfect moment it would be for the moment of their engagement. Upon sitting down, Danna had pulled an expensive oversized sweater of real wool over her head to cut the chill in the air. Now, she felt thin and glamorous in the lazy way belonging to mid-errand celebrities. Once she’d seen Dakota Fanning in the old Chelsea Bed Bath & Beyond wearing an amazing plaid tunic, her hair silky and undone. Danna felt like that now, and it made her want to be seen and coveted and claimed. It was a pure, succulent moment, and she wasn’t prepared for it.
    
    She was furious with herself for abandoning belief in life’s rarity and insisting on having everything out in the open, within her control; for having rejected such a distinct milestone of the female experience, such an ancient love ritual, in demanding no surprises. She became hateful of herself and deeply crabby, and because she’d taken a ten-milligram weed gummy right before the hike, her crabbiness pursued itself inward toward no terminus she could see.
    
    ‘Did you take a video of the bears?’ Danna asked Hal, knowing he hadn’t.
    
    ‘No,’ Hal said, like it was the dumbest question ever. ‘We were standing in front of bears. I thought I was going to have to get big.’
    
    ‘The men we passed,’ Danna said, ‘early on the hike.’
    
    ‘Yeah,’ Hal said.
    
    ‘I asked you if you thought they were a couple or a father and a son or a father and a grandson or half-brothers or whatever.’
    
    ‘Yeah,’ Hal said.
    
    Danna beamed victory at him. ‘The old one was wearing a windbreaker and the young one was wearing a chore coat and suede boots.’
    
    Because there was no video record of the bears’ sweetness, the memory of it quickly faded. By the time Hal and Danna reached the end of the loop, Danna’s high was gone, replaced by a dry throbbing that seemed to come from her amygdala. When she complained about the pain, Hal put an arm around her and offered to cancel their dinner reservation in town and order them room service instead so they could eat while watching Neon Genesis Evangelion in bed. Danna, who’d found comfort in anime since she was small, and who was often made anxious and queasy by the specific emotional pressure of eating in a nice restaurant anyway, agreed that that was what they should do.
    
     
    
    The resort had a little spa, and, on their last day, Hal and Danna went for massages there. They were instructed to remove their clothes and don robes in a locker room, then head down the hall to a quiet room full of couches and armchairs to await the commencement of their appointments. On a long table at the far side of the room was a tall white pot of hot water, cups and saucers, tea bags, and a glass drink dispenser full of water, ice, and fruit. Hal got them both fruity waters and they sat together, sipping them, waiting for their masseuses. Another guy-and-girl couple was in the room too. They were talking angrily at a tall, visibly gay, managerial-looking man holding an electronic tablet.
    
    ‘He booked it like that online,’ said the girl of the couple.
    
    The manager tapped around on his tablet. ‘I’m not seeing on my end here, ah, a request for a female masseuse – on either of your reservations.’ He looked right at the guy. ‘I’d be happy to rebook you with one later on in the week. Or I can offer you your appointment right now, with our masseur Jay, who’s great.’
    
    ‘That’s a male,’ said the guy.
    
    ‘Correct,’ said the manager.
    
    The guy pointed to his girlfriend. ‘But she has a female.’
    
    ‘You know what,’ said the girl, ‘I’ll take the male.’
    
    ‘Babe –’ said the guy. ‘No –’
    
    Hal and Danna squeezed their pinkies together, hard. Danna felt grateful that they were themselves, and that they hadn’t requested masseurs of any particular sex because they were good and open-minded, because they understood certain things about sexuality and gender and the universe that not everyone could understand; they had found each other because of this fact, the fact that they were so much more specially attuned than most people; they were going to spend their whole lives stumbling into shining moments like this one, moments in which their love felt like it conferred onto them a lucky kind of righteousness. Then Danna thought of Hal pulling across four interstate lanes at once. She thought of how he’d probably been the one who gave her the non-warts kind of HPV, the less embarrassing but worse kind. She thought of how Hal never wiped the table quite right. She thought of how one time he’d gotten $4,700 into credit card debt and she’d cried and sat on the toilet googling number 47 spiritual significance, wondering if there was something to learn. She remembered, even now, that 47 was the atomic number of silver and the country code for Norway, that Mars took 47 years to complete an orbital cycle. She remembered coming out of the bathroom and telling Hal what to do to fix things, which was to call his father, and how Hal had said He’s not a rich man and how she’d said back Didn’t he win a Pulitzer? and how Hal had said A Guggenheim, Danna, in fucking 1989, and how Hal, then, had cried, and how she had walked to the door and said I’m gonna go get a bagel, and when I’m home, this is going to be fixed, and Hal had said It’s going to be fixed, and how things had been fixed because she had demanded they be fixed. She had put her mouth to the hose that reached into the gas valve of Hal’s soul and sucked a fix out of him. Danna thought about Hal’s father’s second novel, whose name she could never remember though it was the one that had gotten him the Guggenheim, though she could remember that it was about two young parents who hated each other and loved each other and fought physically and made up from the fighting by fucking and who once, in a pivotal scene, fucked in front of the newborn, which healed them emotionally. He’d published it when Hal was a toddler. There was a single copy hugged up in a shiny cellophane jacket displayed on a high shelf in Hal’s parents’ living room. Danna tried hard to picture the book and its title. Nothing. When Hal had first read the novel as a teenager, he’d stopped speaking to his father, and he’d started acting out and doing drugs, and he’d had to see a child psychologist, who told Hal that his father was, though an adult, really a lot like him – a boy doing his best – and that his mother, too, was just a girl doing her best, and that marriage was a difficult pursuit, and that by showing grace and understanding to his mother and his father, who were themselves just grown children pained and warped by their own parents’ insufficiencies, Hal would be able to live his life free of the burden of their mistakes, which did, in real life, include fighting and fucking loud and hard across all of the rooms of the house Hal had grown up in. Hal’s problems, Danna told herself now, came from that terrible disgusting incestuous novel, and the shelf it sat on, and the LED lamp that hung just above it, insisting upon the book’s rare specialness, prizing it even above Hal’s.
    
    Danna’s pinky felt numb. Hal was still squeezing it because the horrible couple was still giving the resort spa manager a tough time. Danna squeezed Hal’s pinky once, firmly, to tell him to stop squeezing so hard, and he stopped squeezing, but he kept his pinky locked with hers, and he gave it a little tug when the horrible couple said something particularly nasty to the manager, who was fixing their registration on an iPad. When the manager finally bowed his head and walked away, tucking his iPad under his arm, Danna let herself look at the couple straight on. They were smiling at each other.
    
     
    
    After their massages, Danna and Hal met up again in the waiting room, where they made cups of tea and sat in glowing silence. There was a video playing on a loop on a television in the corner; it showed escalatingly gorgeous drone shots of lavender fields in what looked like the south of France. When they’d had enough, they took their cooling teas with them to the steam room, and as they were the only ones, it seemed, left in the spa, they unbelted their robes and sat together half-naked and sweating and talking about how good they felt and about how horrible the horrible couple from the waiting room had been and about how excited they were to go back to the room and watch more anime and order more room service.
    
    ‘You want to fight for a life with me, right?’ Danna asked Hal.
    
    ‘Baby,’ Hal said, and kissed her shoulder.
    
    ‘Because I want to fight for a life with you.’
    
    Hal looked at Danna, seeming pre-upset. ‘You don’t have to fight for a life with me,’ he said. He said it without malice or strangeness, but Danna, for some reason, picked up both malice and strangeness in how he said it.
    
    ‘What do you mean?’ she asked.
    
    ‘All I want out of, like, my whole life is a life with you,’ Hal said. ‘So you don’t have to like – fight me for it. What do you mean?’
    
    Danna looked up at the wet ceiling and thought of how to answer in a way that wouldn’t destroy the womby post-massage safety they’d both just been feeling. She didn’t know how to explain that her whole life felt like a fight for itself, a struggle against her own every thought and fear; that she nightly had vivid, lucid dreams of having to stab a shadowy home invader with a dull knife over and over again until he finally died and relented his claim on her and her possessions; that she felt she’d never reach a place of true openness in any arena, possibly not even in her relationship with Hal, whom she often thought of as her twin, her brother, a pearl she’d formed from the grit of her own ugliness; so instead she told him she’d meant nothing, and she asked if Hal liked the flavor of tea he’d chosen. He said that he did, and then he asked if Danna liked her flavor, and she said that she did too. Then all at once Danna felt pretty bad; she felt hungover, like there was a nauseous ache in her chest and her head and her butthole; then she was asleep.
    
    When she woke up Hal was patting her face and saying, ‘Whoa whoa whoa.’
    
    ‘Did I just pass out?’ Danna asked Hal.
    
    ‘Yeah,’ Hal said, looking toward the door. He was holding Danna’s shoulders with both hands. She was slouching pretty badly. She realized his hands were kind of all that was holding her up. ‘Hello,’ Hal shouted, ‘excuse me, can we get a little help in here? Jesus fucking Christ,’ he said, because ceiling steam was dripping into his eyes. He blinked hard, trying to get it out, as he pulled Danna’s arms through the armholes of her robe.
    
    ‘I’ve never passed out before,’ Danna said.
    
    ‘It’s hot,’ Hal said. ‘It’s way too fucking hot in here. Hello?’
    
    ‘Have you ever passed out before?’ Danna asked.
    
    ‘No,’ Hal said. ‘I don’t think?’
    
    ‘How would you not remember?’
    
    ‘I think I blacked out for just a second that time I hit my head,’ Hal said, referring to a time a year ago when he’d hit his head, ‘but I’m not sure.’
    
    ‘How could you not be sure?’ Danna asked. She felt radiant, warm, in touch with a higher consciousness. She’d fallen out of her own existence and fallen back into it. As someone who’d now officially passed out, she felt part of a community, part of a new experience; she needed to know whether Hal could share in it, or whether he couldn’t.
    
    ‘How can I be of –’ said the tall gay iPad manager, pushing open the steam-room door, but he didn’t get to the word ‘service’. Danna watched Hal make desperate eye contact with him, and then she watched the manager prop the door open with a towel and duck out. She heard him press something outside and the steam stopped curling up at her from the floor. Soon the manager was back with a tall, sweating glass of water and a wet cloth. He handed both of them to Hal, who handed both of them to Danna, who felt no need for either of them.
    
    ‘I’m fine,’ she said. ‘It wasn’t like I thought it would be. I’m feeling fine. It was kind of the best I’ve ever felt?’
    
    ‘Please drink some water,’ Hal said. He took the cloth from Danna and put it on top of her head. Her pleasure deepened.
    
    ‘Can we go – can we go back to the room with the lavender video?’ she asked, and Hal nodded, and the manager nodded, and together they helped her stand and walk down the dim hallway toward the staging room, and they sat her down on the couch in front of the television, and masseurs and masseuses were bringing her cooler and cooler washcloths, and she couldn’t tear her eyes away from the drone footage, and suddenly there was a squat glass bottle of apple juice before her, and she felt like a baby, and she thought of Hal kissing her shoulder and calling her baby, and she looked over at Hal and told him that she was his baby, and she hugged him, and she sipped her juice, and she thought about her ring, and then, for practice, she made the face she hoped she’d make when Hal gave it to her."

    "text": "Spring should have been full of the odor of spring, of flowers and grass. There should have been blue, shallow scents wafting over the town, deep green odors that assaulted the nostrils like wine in a dark alley. But what the people of Wujiapo noticed under the setting sun was the stench of blood. Dripping red and drifting down from the ridge, one purplish-brown wave after another, like autumn persimmons in the midst of a green spring forest. What in the world is that? someone shouted. People carrying their dinner to the canteen stopped with their rice bowls held mid-air, lifted their heads and sniffed.

    Butcher Li’s family slaughtered another pig, someone observed.
    
    After a moment of silence, everyone went back to their food and drink. The next day was the end of March, it was market day – naturally the butcher’s family would slaughter a pig. But usually Butcher Li woke up early to slaughter his animals, so the meat was still fresh when he arrived in town. Why, then, was he slaughtering at dusk? And why was the stench so much more pungent than usual? The villagers didn’t give the matter much thought. Spring had come, the wheat had woken from winter with a surge of growth, the grass was thick. The fields needed to be hoed and fertilized, and, for those who had access to water, irrigated. Everyone was scurrying around like ants. No one had time to waste thinking about anyone else.
    
    Butcher Li lived up on the ridge by an intersection. When he gave up farming for commerce, it turned out to be fortunate that he lived near the road. He was now in the slaughter business, but still needed a way to transport his goods to market. It was also convenient when families in nearby villages were planning weddings or funerals and wanted to bring him a pig to slaughter. He had built himself a two-story tile-roofed house surrounded by a brick courtyard. The family used the first floor to slaughter pigs, and to sell sundries, food and drink. They lived on the second floor, which also had two small guest rooms. When someone passing by happened to be tired, they might stop and have a bite to eat or drink. If they became tipsy they would proceed upstairs. By the time the sun came up they’d have sobered up, and would drowsily pay their bill and head off.
    
    Even though these small rooms only had a bed and a desk in them, a fifteen-watt bulb and half a candle for when the electricity went out, it turned out that even the County Party Committee’s Party Secretary had slept in one of them. Someone claimed this was only because the Party Secretary’s car had broken down, and that he’d had no choice. You’re farting out of your mouth, Butcher Li retorted. Could anyone really believe that the Party Secretary’s driver would let his car break down? The real reason Party Secretary Zhao stayed, Butcher Li insisted, was because he wanted to visit an ordinary citizen’s house – to see how they were getting by, and to have a chat with a man like Butcher Li.
    
    The Party Secretary did in fact stay at Butcher Li’s for a night, in the east-side guest room. After this, Butcher Li’s business thrived. The table, bed, bedding, slippers, and face-washing basin were carefully cleaned and preserved exactly as they had been left by Party Secretary Zhao. As a result, the room’s price increased 50 percent, from ten to fifteen yuan a night. Everyone wanted to stay in that room. Even long-haul drivers would keep their foot on the gas, determined to spend a night where the Party Secretary had slept.
    
    Just as fine wine cannot be watered down, so Butcher Li’s house still stank of meat. The people of Wujiapo all knew this to be true. And now whenever something extraordinary happened to Butcher Li’s family, the villagers were not surprised. If the county’s Party Secretary had slept in the house, anything could happen there. When, as market day approached, Butcher Li slaughtered a pig in the evening instead of before dawn, filling the spring evening with the stench of blood, no one thought it unusual. After slaughtering and butchering the pig, Butcher Li took two slabs of pork, rinsed them and covered them in plastic wrap. That way no one would be able to tell that it wasn’t fresh pork when the meat was taken to market.
    
    Everyone was still idly eating and chatting in the village canteen. After emptying their bowls, some went home for more rice. Others didn’t want to go home, and tried to send children on their behalf. The children had just emerged from the houses with their own bowls, and didn’t want to turn around to fetch more rice. The parents complained that their children lacked filial instinct, saying that even after they had gone to the trouble of raising them, they were too lazy to return home to get them rice. The parents said that if they had known their children would turn out this way they would never have had them in the first place. The children were aggrieved. They had never actually said they wouldn’t go, and were being yelled at just for hesitating. Who asked you to give birth to me? they said. The parents were stunned, then grabbed the shoes they were sitting on and started hurling them, filling the canteen with dust. The other patrons quickly covered up their bowls to prevent their rice from getting dirty. Through the commotion came a shout. What is everyone arguing about? Is it wrong for parents to ask their children to go home to fetch them rice?
    
    The canteen fell silent. The children realized that they were at fault.
    
    As the villagers drank, they gazed at the road leading to the ridge and saw Butcher Li descending into the village.
    
    –
    
    Liu Genbao left the canteen feeling uneasy, like he was leaving the freedom of the open fields for an examination. When he got home, his father had already finished eating and was smoking in the courtyard, his cigarette flickering in the twilight. Genbao’s mother was in the kitchen washing up. The clanking sound of pots and dishes was drowned out by the sound of running water.
    
    Genbao stepped into the kitchen, took a rice bowl still half full of rice, and pushed it to the edge of the kitchen table. It seemed like he wanted to say something, but instead he just gazed at his mother, then bowed his head and walked outside.
    
    He squatted down in front of his father.
    
    What’s wrong? his father asked.
    
    Nothing.
    
    If something’s wrong, just say it.
    
    Father, Genbao said, I want to go to jail.
    
    His father looked at him in astonishment. Through the glow of the cigarette Genbao watched the old man’s face lose its soft, multi-hued expression and become like hard stone. The father removed his cigarette from his mouth and stared at his son as though he were a total stranger asking for directions.
    
    Genbao, what are you saying?
    
    Because it was getting dark, Genbao couldn’t see the surprise in his father’s eyes. What he saw was a mass of darkness. He removed one of his shoes and sat down in front of his father. He sat quietly with his arms on his knees and his hands interlocked, the way you might sit while peeling beans.
    
    Genbao, his father said, what were you saying just now?
    
    Father, I need to discuss this with you. If you and Mother agree, I want to spend a few nights in jail on someone’s behalf.
    
    Damn it, boy, are you crazy?
    
    Father, Genbao bowed his head, I’m trying to discuss this properly with you.
    
    There was a pause. Then his father asked, On whose behalf do you want to do this?
    
    On behalf of the mayor.
    
    His father laughed. And why would the mayor need you to do this?
    
    Just now, in the canteen, Butcher Li said that the mayor ran over a young man in his twenties, someone from Zhangzhai village. Butcher Li said that someone needs to take responsibility for the mayor’s actions. The mayor is the mayor. Who can make him take responsibility for anything? So someone else needs to go to the county’s transportation division and claim responsibility. They need to say, I’m the one who ran that person over – I had too much to drink at Butcher Li’s, and then I ran over the young man in my tractor. We won’t need to worry about what happens afterwards, because the mayor has already taken care of everything. Butcher Li said that the family of the man from Zhangzhai has already been given money. But whoever claims responsibility for the accident will need to go to the Public Security Bureau’s squad room and stay there for a week or two.
    
    The moon had risen in the sky. Wujiapo was so quiet it was like there was no village there at all. Genbao’s mother seemed to have heard everything he’d said. She didn’t immediately respond, and instead she brought a small flower basket and a stool outside. She placed the stool between her husband and her son, then placed the basket on the stool. She sat down in front of the flowers and looked at her son and her husband. She sighed, and joined the silence that was extending between them.
    
     
    
    By this point Genbao was already twenty-nine, but he had yet to find a wife and establish a family – and in this respect the Liu family was different. Not because they were poor, since they no longer were all that poor. They were just different. When the drought came, every other family in the village built tile-roofed houses, while the Liu family stayed in their original thatched-roof house. Genbao was a timid, honest man. When the family’s crops were being eaten by another family’s livestock, Genbao would lift his shovel to beat the animals like anyone else, but as soon as he did he’d remember that the livestock had an owner, and slowly he’d put the shovel away. Who would dare marry someone as cowardly as that? The family had tried several matchmaking sessions, but whenever a young woman came to the Liu house, she would take one look at Genbao and promptly leave without a word. Now Genbao had to struggle to set up meetings with women looking for a second marriage, much less a first.
    
    Half a year earlier, a relative offered to introduce Genbao to a widow. They didn’t specify what the widow looked like, but they did say that she was twenty-six and already had two children. Genbao was reluctant, but the relative said, Why don’t you meet her before deciding? Genbao agreed.
    
    To his surprise the first thing she asked was, Do you have any brothers?
    
    I’m an only child, Genbao replied.
    
    Does your family share a surname with any of the other families in the village?
    
    Ours is the only family in the village with the surname Liu.
    
    Do you have any relatives currently serving in a village or township cadre?
    
    Genbao shook his head.
    
    Sighing, the woman stood up. Then why in the world did you have me come all this way to see you? she said, angrily. Didn’t the matchmaker tell you that my first husband got in a fight with someone over land and water, and hung himself because the other person got the better of him? Didn’t the matchmaker tell you that I’m not looking for money, but for a man with power – someone who doesn’t need to bully others? At the very least I need a man who can avoid being bullied. The woman walked out of the house. She looked around the courtyard, then turned and stared at Genbao. Today is market day, she said, and I’ve wasted the entire day traveling twelve or thirteen li for you to see me. I could have gone into town to sell vegetables instead, and I would have earned seventy or eighty yuan. Instead you tricked me into coming here. I’m not going to ask you to compensate me for the entire eighty yuan, but don’t you think that at the very least you should give me fifty?
    
    What are you talking about? Genbao asked in surprise.
    
    You tricked me into wasting an entire day, so you should compensate me fifty yuan.
    
    Genbao ground his teeth. How can you be so shameless?
    
    Yes, I am shameless, the woman said. I won’t leave until you beat me or give me fifty yuan. If you won’t do either, I’ll start screaming. I’ll say that you fondled me as soon as you saw me.
    
    Genbao had no choice but to go back inside and fetch a fifty-yuan bill. He thrust it into her hand. Get out of here, he said. I don’t ever want to see you in Wujiapo again.
    
    The woman took the money and looked at it. If you dare to slap me right now, she said, I’ll marry you.
    
    Get out of here. I’ve given you the money, so go ahead and leave.
    
    You’re ill, the woman said, mentally ill. You should go to the clinic and get treated. The woman threw the fifty-yuan bill at Genbao and walked away. After taking several steps, she turned around and said, You’re a spineless wimp. Whoever marries you is guaranteed to be bullied for the rest of her life.
    
    To tell the truth, no one ever did bully Genbao’s family. But because their home only had a single door and a single courtyard, and they didn’t have close relatives or belong to a larger clan, Genbao was unable to find a wife. He was already twenty-nine, and in the blink of an eye would be thirty, which is to say that he’d lived half a lifetime. For Genbao to be almost thirty without a family or career left him unable to lift his head in the village, and made his parents feel a deep sense of regret, like they had let their son down.
    
     
    
    Genbao’s father finished one pack of cigarettes then picked up another. He didn’t immediately light a new one, and instead placed the pack at his feet. He took a handful of peanuts and began peeling them, but he didn’t eat them. He gazed at his son in the moonlight. Genbao was still sitting on his shoe with his head bowed, like a soft bundle on the ground. The father gazed at the family’s thatch-roofed house, which they’d never been able to afford to renovate. The house was short and dilapidated. On the slope was a grass pit that was near collapse. In the moonlight it resembled an open grave. There was the windowless kitchen, in the doorway a broken water jar. The pigsty, mud wall, door frame, and stone trough were all very sturdy, but for some reason the family had never succeeded in raising pigs. Whenever they tried, the pigs died. Then they tried sheep, but the sheep died. In the end the family turned the pigsty into a chicken coop. But even during the peak egg-laying season in summer the hens could go three to five days without laying. None of their hens could lay an egg every other day, much less every day, like some families’ hens – some even laid two eggs a day, or at least three eggs every two days. This is how the Liu family lived, and at that moment Genbao’s father seemed to be able to see it all laid out before him. He shifted his gaze away from the moonlight, ate some of the peanuts he was holding, and complained that they were dry and tasteless. Have some of these, his wife said, Uncle brought them down from the ridge today. Genbao’s father took a handful of peanuts and proceeded to peel them. Genbao, he said, eat up!
    
    I don’t want any.
    
    How do you know that if you plead guilty on behalf of the mayor, you’ll only get a week or two in jail?
    
    That’s what Butcher Li said.
    
    And who did Butcher Li hear it from?
    
    Why would he need to hear it from anybody? said Genbao. The mayor killed the man in front of his place. The Party Secretary even spent a night there once.
    
    So what will you do after you complete the mayor’s sentence? his mother asked.
    
    Give it a rest, the father said. You ask what Genbao is going to do after he gets out? What do you think he’ll do? Who asked the mayor to be mayor, or to make our son go to jail on the mayor’s behalf ?
    
    With that he turned and looked at his son. Genbao, if you really want to do this, then go ahead. Tell Butcher Li you are willing to go to jail for the mayor. But remember, Butcher Li’s real name is Li Xing, so call him Uncle Li Xing. Don’t call him Butcher Li to his face.
    
     
    
    It was hectic at Butcher Li’s. The family had added a couple of 200-watt lightbulbs to the courtyard, which drowned out the moonlight. One of the region’s mines was having a celebration, and many people had arrived with pigs for Butcher Li to slaughter. But the next day was market day, and Butcher Li couldn’t neglect his regulars. Butcher Li had to remove his regular cutting board and set up a larger one. He did the slaughtering himself, but had hired two young people from a neighboring village to help.
    
    There was a crowd in the courtyard – miners, village children, customers from local villages. Genbao could hear the bloody screams coming from the slaughterhouse all the way up from the village. He shuddered, but controlled himself. They were only pigs, not people. As he stepped through the courtyard gate, which was large enough for a car, there were already two slabs of pork hanging from the rack. A shirtless Butcher Li was dousing them with water. He dished out one scoop of water after another, and red blood flowed over the muddy ground and through a ditch to the back of the house. The stench of blood permeated everything. One of the young men helping Butcher Li was boiling a pot of water to scald the pig’s hide, while the other was shaving off the remaining hair. Pig hair has a peculiar stench, like animal hide roasting in a fire. Butcher Li’s house was filled with this smell all year round, and Genbao couldn’t imagine how the Party Secretary put up with it. But the Party Secretary had. There was a bright sign on the door of the east-side guest room that read: the county party committee’s party secretary zhao slept here. Genbao noticed that the west-side room had a sign now too, which read: the county’s mayor slept here. Genbao was confused. He hadn’t heard that the mayor had stayed at Butcher Li’s, but he figured he must have, because otherwise Butcher Li would not have put up a sign.
    
    Genbao squeezed through the crowd and went over to Butcher Li. He waited until Butcher Li had finished rinsing the slab of pork, then quietly greeted him: Uncle Li.
    
    Without turning around, Butcher Li wiped the drops of bloody water from his shoulder and used his forearm to wipe sweat from his brow. Then he started rinsing another bloody slab of pork. Is that Genbao? he asked.
    
    Yes, Uncle Li, it’s me.
    
    Butcher Li tossed a scoop of water into the pig’s abdominal cavity.
    
    Are you here to accept punishment on the mayor’s behalf ? This is a great opportunity. People burn incense for a chance like this.
    
    The bloody water splashed onto Genbao’s face, and he took a step back.
    
    I’ve discussed it with my father, and I’m willing to do it.
    
    Butcher Li tossed another scoop of water.
    
    It’s not simply a question of whether you are willing. Go inside and wait.
    
    Inside, Genbao found three other villagers sitting in the dining room. One was Wu Zhuzi, from the west side of the village. Zhuzi was in his forties, but his wife had recently run away with her children to a neighboring village, where she was staying with the younger brother of a village cadre. Another was Zhao Quezi, or ‘Cripple Zhao’, from the south side of the village. Quezi had been living a good life until a brick kiln collapsed and injured him. His life imploded, and he’d gotten into debt with the credit union. Then there was Li Qing, who had a business in town, and whose family had bought a GAZ car to transport goods to market. Genbao knew Zhuzi and Quezi were there to try to serve the mayor’s jail time, just like he was. But he wasn’t sure what Li Qing wanted.
    
    Li Qing’s head was bowed in embarrassment. He looked as though he had just stolen something. My younger brother graduated from the teachers college this year, he said, and I was hoping the mayor would be able to help arrange for him to return to the village to teach.
    
    Zhuzi gazed coldly at Li Qing and said, You’re already doing well for yourself.
    
    Li Qing bowed his head even further, his face redder than the bloodstained snow on the ground outside.
    
    Genbao sat down on the empty stool. Outside, a pig was crying out, rough and scary – like a train whistle, only shorter and the tones uneven. Mixed in with the cry was the sound of breathing and people shouting. After a while, everything fell quiet again. The blade had moved from the pig’s neck to its internal organs. All that remained was the sound of Butcher Li instructing his assistants to shave one pig and disembowel another – and the voices of those commenting on which pigs were lean and which were fat. It was warm inside, and Butcher Li, busy earning his money, seemed to have no interest in the young men waiting for him.
    
    Butcher Li’s wife and children were upstairs watching television, and the sound of martial arts descended from the rooftop like bricks and tiles. Genbao gazed up at the ceiling, as did the other three.
    
    It’s the middle of the night, said Li Qing.
    
    If you’re in a hurry you can leave, Zhuzi replied.
    
    I’m not in a hurry, Li Qing said. I’ll wait until sunrise if I need to.
    
    Quezi turned to Genbao. Brother, don’t make the same mistake as us. You don’t have a family, and you’re educated. If you end up going to jail for the mayor, your reputation will be ruined. Then how will you ever manage to marry and raise a family?
    
    Genbao wanted to respond, but he couldn’t think of what to say. As he was struggling to respond, Li Qing answered for him. It’s only by doing this on the mayor’s behalf that he’ll ever be able to establish a family. Genbao looked gratefully at Li Qing, and Li Qing nodded.
    
    Because Li Qing and Butcher Li were relatives, Li Qing was more at ease in the house than the others. He looked around, and even went upstairs to watch some television. When he came back down he went out to Butcher Li to ask him to make up his mind. But after a long loop through the house, Li Qing came back and said, Uncle Li’s busy. He told me we have to decide among ourselves which of us goes.
    
    Choose among themselves? But how could they choose? This was no solution, since none of them would choose anyone but themselves. The four of them stared at one another, but seeing that no one showed any hint of backing down, they all turned away.
    
    Time trudged forward like a rhinoceros. By this point the night was as dark as a bottomless well. They all sat there until the television upstairs fell silent. Butcher Li slaughtered five pigs in a row, and Zhuzi and Quezi fell asleep leaning against the edge of the table. Genbao assumed Butcher Li had completely forgotten about them. He wanted to go ask Butcher Li to let him claim responsibility for the mayor’s crime. If he was selected, he would head off right away; otherwise he could at least return home to sleep.
    
    Just then someone started pounding on the door.
    
    It wasn’t Butcher Li, but one of the young men who’d come to help him. He was pounding on the door with the knife he used for the pigs, and the fresh blood on the blade trembled like soft tofu and fell to the ground. Seeing that everyone was awake, the young man tossed four balls of paper onto the table. It’s already late, he said, and Uncle Li says that you shouldn’t keep waiting. Here are four lots – one of them contains a black pig hair, while the other three contain white ones. Whoever gets the black hair can be the mayor’s benefactor.
    
    Suddenly, the four guests were wide awake. The answer was before them. The lots had been made of paper from a cigarette pack, cut into four pieces. From the outside each was red and florid, festive and auspicious, but three contained white pig hairs. The guests all stared at the lots, their eyes large and bright. None of them wanted to make the first move.
    
    Take them, the young man said. Go ahead and take your lots, so that I can get back to the pigs.
    
    Without speaking, Li Qing picked up one of the pieces of paper.
    
    Everyone else followed.
    
    Genbao took the final lot. But before he had opened his, he heard Zhuzi burst out laughing. Mine is the black pig hair! My wife and child will finally be returned to me! He placed his lot in the middle of the table. A horrible smell radiated up from the black pig hair.
    
    Well deserved, said the young man in the doorway. You go be the mayor’s benefactor. Now everyone else can go to bed.
    
    Quezi looked at the white pig hair in his hand. Damn it, he said, I should have left ages ago!
    
    Li Qing looked at the black pig hair on the table, and without a word got up and walked away, kicking the door frame on his way out.
    
    Genbao also left without saying a word.
    
    Outside, a cool breeze was blowing down the mountain ridge road, and from afar wafted the green fragrance of the wheat seedlings. Genbao took a deep breath and discovered that he wasn’t in the least bit tired.
    
     
    
    When Genbao got home his parents were out. Entering the courtyard, he smelled baked buns. In the middle of the room there was a stool with a blue package on it. He opened the package and found the clothing his mother had purchased in anticipation of his jail time – pants, shirts, socks, and shoes. His mother had even packed a few summer shirts and shorts. The package also contained cloth shoes and three pairs of new military-style liberation shoes that his mother had somehow managed to purchase. Genbao had no idea why his mother had packed him so many different pairs of shoes. Even if he had been able to go to jail, he would still have returned within a week or two, so why so many pairs of shoes?
    
    By this point it was the middle of the night, and apart from the pig cries drifting down from Butcher Li’s house up on the ridge, there wasn’t a sound in the village. The room was permeated with the soapy-rotten smell of new shoes and old clothing, combined with the sweet noodle-paste smell of the shoe soles. Genbao stood for a while in front of the package, then went to the kitchen table. His mother had prepared him some dried food. The scent of baked buns mixed with chopped scallions and sesame oil flowed like water, dripping down from the table onto the floor. Each bun had been baked until it was as large as a griddle, and then cut into quarters. Each yielded twelve pieces, stacked neatly in the middle of the table.
    
    When Genbao saw the baked buns he began to weep.
    
    He went back out and stood in the middle of the courtyard. To the west he could see the entire sleeping village. In this array of tile-roofed houses, all glowing blue in the moonlight, his own family’s house was like a pile of dead grass. Genbao felt an acute sense of sorrow. As he started back inside, his neighbor’s sister-in-law arrived.
    
    Brother Genbao, she said, I heard what’s happened. Your parents were at my place, and we were all very anxious. Fortunately for you, my younger cousin just got divorced, and she came to visit me today. When she heard you were going to jail on the mayor’s behalf, and that you were single, she immediately agreed to marry you. Your parents are taking her back to my house now. You should go meet her. She is as tender as though she had never been married. Genbao, why don’t you hurry up and go? she asked. What are you staring at?
    
    The neighbor’s sister-in-law was originally from a town forty li away, and she was svelte and smart. She took Genbao’s hand and tried to lead him back to her home. He felt the cotton-softness and warmth of her hand, and smelled the feminine scent of her hair, like the smell of summer wheat suddenly wafting through a cold, winter’s day, and a hot excitement went through his body. His head buzzed, and he had to struggle to extricate himself from her grasp. He wanted to say that he wasn’t going to jail for the mayor, that Zhuzi was the one who had drawn the correct lot. But what he ended up saying instead was, Please don’t pull me.
    
    What’s wrong? the neighbor’s sister-in-law said. Won’t you marry my cousin?
    
    I’m going to jail, Genbao said. That’s not a good thing.
    
    But you’re going to jail on behalf of the mayor.
    
    The sentence might not be just ten or twenty days. Someone was killed. The sentence could be six months or a year.
    
    The neighbor’s sister-in-law laughed. Did you see the three pairs of liberation shoes in your packet? My cousin went to the neighboring village’s supply and marketing depot in the middle of the night to buy them. She said people in jail all need to work in a brick factory making bricks, and it’s hard on their shoes. Whenever someone is sent to that sort of labor camp, they need to serve at least a year.
    
    So I might need to serve two or three?
    
    My cousin cherishes affection, the sister-in-law replied. She divorced her husband because he was always looking for mistresses in the city. She isn’t worried about you serving jail time. She’s just afraid of men who have money to spend on city hotels and bathhouses.
    
    In that case, tell me – if I go to your house to meet her, what should I say?
    
    Take a few pieces of the scallion buns your mother baked for you and say that you’ve brought her a midnight snack.
    
    The neighbor’s sister-in-law left. She walked briskly, like a goat hopping through a grassy field. As Genbao stood watching her, she turned and said, Act quickly. If you delay, the sun will come up and she will melt into the night.
    
    Genbao did not return to the kitchen for the baked bun pieces as his neighbor’s sister-in-law had urged him to do. Instead, he continued standing in the courtyard, reflecting for a moment. Then he followed the neighbor’s sister-in-law out the courtyard gate. He did not go to her house, but headed for the west side of the village. He went to Zhuzi’s house. Zhuzi’s house was tile-roofed. Even the house’s gate tower had a tile roof. The building was large and tall, and it obviously belonged to a well-off family. But even though the family was wealthy, the wife had run off with another man – a carpenter, the younger brother of a village party secretary.
    
    Through the gate, Genbao could see that the lights were still on. Naturally, Zhuzi had not yet gone to bed. The next morning, after breakfast, he would need to go with Butcher Li into town to meet the mayor. After meeting the mayor, he would need to be driven to the county seat’s public security bureau. Then he would be detained and taken to jail to await trial, after which it would be many days before he’d be able to return home. Needless to say, Zhuzi would need to spend the entire night preparing for his trip to jail.
    
    Genbao knocked lightly on the gate.
    
    The gate was made of solid elm wood, and Genbao felt as though he was knocking on stone. By that point the moon had set, and in the darkness, the knocking flew down the village street like small stones. No sound emerged in response.
    
    Genbao knocked harder.
    
    Finally, Zhuzi answered. Who is it?
    
    Brother Zhuzi, it’s me.
    
    Oh, Genbao. What’s the matter?
    
    Open the gate. There is something I need to tell you.
    
    Zhuzi came out of the house to open the gate. As he did so, Genbao knelt down in front of him.
    
    Genbao, Zhuzi said, taking a step back, what are you doing? What does this mean?
    
    Brother Zhuzi, let me go to jail on the mayor’s behalf. You, for better or worse, have already established a family, and you know what it’s like to be a man. But I’ll be thirty soon, and I still don’t know what it’s like to be a man. If you let me go to jail on the mayor’s behalf, he will surely ask me if there’s anything he can help with, and the first thing I’ll ask is that he help return your wife and child to you. OK?
    
    Zhuzi stared at Genbao in the lamplight.
    
    Genbao kowtowed and said, Brother Zhuzi, I’m begging you.
    
    If I let you go, you’ll speak to the mayor on my behalf ?
    
    If I don’t discuss your problem first, and fail to ask the mayor to help return your wife and child to you, then let me, Genbao, have even lower status than your great-grandson.
    
    Then stand up, Zhuzi said.
    
    Genbao kowtowed to Zhuzi three more times before standing up.
    
     
    
    The next day, spring-morning sunlight rained down like a river of gold. The mountain fields, ridges, forests and villages glimmered. When the residents of Wujiapo woke up on that spring morning, everyone knew that an auspicious event had occurred in Genbao’s household. Genbao was going to go to jail on behalf of the mayor. His travel bundle was packed, his bedding was folded and tied, and his baked scallion buns were ready in his dry-food bag.
    
    Genbao was going to be the mayor’s benefactor.
    
    He drank a bowl of Sichuan millet soup, ate some pickled vegetables and fried buns, and when he walked out the door with his bags, he saw several villagers standing in front of his house – a crowd that included Li Qing, Quezi, Zhuzi, his neighbor’s sister-in-law, and the sister-in-law’s cousin. Genbao and the cousin had become engaged overnight. Even if you are jailed for a year or two, she had told him, I’ll still wait for you. The next morning, she accompanied her elder cousin to come see Genbao off. Most of the villagers didn’t yet know that the two of them were engaged, and assumed that she had simply come with her cousin to watch the commotion.
    
    Genbao’s father was standing behind him, holding Genbao’s bags and bedding. He looked proud, like his son was leaving home to accomplish something big. He had set aside his regular cigarettes and was smoking filter tips. But he wasn’t really smoking, he was merely using it to produce swirls of smoke. Genbao’s mother was holding the dry-ration bag, and when she stepped outside and saw the sister-in-law’s cousin, her face brightened as she walked toward her. Genbao couldn’t hear what his mother said to the woman, but he could see them talking. The cousin took the bag of rations from his mother, and supported her as though she were an elderly person crossing a bridge. In this group of people who had gathered to see Genbao off, the sister-in-law’s cousin resembled a summer flower blooming on a grassy hill. She was from the town, and her family’s home had been separated from the town government compound by only a single wall. When she was young, she would often run into the town government’s courtyard holding her rice bowl. Like her elder cousin, she was unusually worldly, and her clothing, speech, and behavior were quite different from the other Wujiapo residents. When she took Genbao’s mother by the arm, everyone who saw the gesture felt their hearts brighten, and they looked on with surprise and envy.
    
    The crowd had originally consisted of ten or so people, but after Genbao and his family emerged, it grew. When people on their way to work in the fields heard that Genbao was going to be the mayor’s benefactor, they hurried over to congratulate him and to see him off. Brother Genbao, one said, as you advance, make sure you don’t forget us! What do you mean, as I advance? Genbao said. I’m going to jail! But on whose behalf ? the other person said. For the mayor. You’re going to be the mayor’s savior and benefactor. I once thought of you as a brother, and never imagined that you had such great prospects before you.
    
    Genbao smiled, but did not respond.
    
    Genbao slowly walked among the crowd that had gathered. Someone tried to take his baggage for him, but he said there was no need. He took a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and handed one to everyone. If anyone declined, Genbao stuffed a cigarette directly into their mouth. He wanted to approach where Zhuzi, Quezi, and Li Qing were huddling peacefully by the roadside, as though the previous night’s struggle had never happened. But so many people were crowding tightly around him, struggling to speak to him, that in the end he had no choice but to simply wave and nod. It had been a long time since the villagers had seen someone off in such a festive fashion. Even when a villager’s son left to join the military, people didn’t turn out like this. Pleased, Genbao walked toward the village entrance, and when he reached the canteen he stopped and waved to the crowd, saying, Go home, go home! I’m going to jail, not joining the military.
    
    Everyone followed him all the way up the hill toward Butcher Li’s house.
    
    From the sunlit ridge, Butcher Li was gesturing to the crowd. Genbao quickened his pace, but the faster he moved, the more Butcher Li seemed to gesture. It looked like he was holding his hands up to his mouth and shouting. But because he was so far away no one could hear him clearly. Everyone guessed that he was trying to tell Genbao to hurry up.
    
    Genbao jogged forward in front of the crowd. He didn’t want Butcher Li to have to wait too long up on the ridge. But as Genbao was leaving the crowd of villagers and running up the ridge, one of the young men who had been helping Butcher Li slaughter the night before ran part of the way down toward him. As he approached, the young man stood on a stone by the side of the road and shouted to Genbao, Uncle Li says for you not to come up, he shouted. The mayor sent over a message this morning saying that he doesn’t need anyone to claim responsibility on his behalf.
    
    Abruptly, Genbao came to a stop. He stood in the middle of the road like a telephone pole, staring at the young man. What are you saying? he shouted. My God, what are you saying?
    
    There’s no need for you to go to prison, the young man shouted back. The parents of the man the mayor ran over are reasonable people. They don’t blame the mayor for what happened, and they didn’t report him. They didn’t even want compensation. All they asked was that the mayor accept the dead man’s younger brother as his godson . . .
    
    Genbao’s legs began to feel weak. He struggled to channel strength down to his ankles to prevent himself from collapsing. He gazed up at the top of the ridge, where Butcher Li was directing several people to load a car with fresh pork. Butcher Li had his back to Genbao. He was dancing back and forth. His shoulders were as wide as a door, and his strength defied description.
    
    The villagers were approaching, talking and laughing. The sun rose higher in the sky – bright, bright red."

    "text": "I was in the waiting room. Then I was in the examination room. There was a chair, and another chair, and a hydraulic doctor bed. Sit down, the doctor said. I didn’t know where. Not on the bed, he said. I sat on a chair.

    ‘I think I have a concussion,’ I said.
    
    ‘Why do you think that?’ the doctor said.
    
    ‘My nephew hit me.’
    
    ‘He hit you?’
    
    ‘In the nose. Then in the back of the head.’
    
    ‘How old is he?’ the doctor said.
    
    ‘Fourteen,’ I said.
    
    ‘Okay,’ he said, ‘take off your shirt.’
    
    ‘Really?’ I said.
    
    ‘Sure,’ the doctor said. I unbuttoned my shirt. He shone a light in my eyes.
    
    The light was on the end of a cone. The cone was set at ninety degrees on the end of a metal rod. It looked like a thing dentists use for looking at mouths.
    
    ‘No concussion,’ the doctor said. It didn’t seem like he could tell that just by shining a cone in my eyes.
    
    ‘Looks like you have a little eczema here, though,’ he said. He pointed to my chest then spun away in his chair.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    I looked down at myself. There was a red patch, and what looked like a slightly raised piece of dead skin in the centre of my chest. Just to the right of where I assumed my heart was.
    
    ‘Okay,’ I said.
    
    ‘Don’t worry,’ he said, looking at his computer, ‘very treatable. I’m writing you a prescription. For hydrocortisol cream.’
    
    ‘Don’t you mean hydrocortisone?’
    
    ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘hydrocortisone. That is what I said.’
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    My brother’s wife, when I was back at the house, said I shouldn’t have provoked her son.
    
    ‘He’s very sensitive,’ she said.
    
    ‘What?’ I said. ‘I didn’t provoke him.’
    
    ‘He loved your dad,’ my brother’s wife said. ‘They had a real connection.’
    
    ‘I don’t see what that has to do with anything.’
    
    ‘Are you really going to wear that outfit?’ she said. I was wearing a T-shirt with lots of Phils on it: Phil Leotardo, Phil Neville, the Philippines, the concept of ‘Philanthropy’, Philadelphia (the spread), the London Philharmonic, Prince Philip.
    
    ‘What?’ I said. ‘No. I am going to wear a suit.’
    
    ‘It has a stain on it. You can’t wear that.’
    
    ‘I am going to change,’ I said.
    
    My brother walked into the kitchen and kissed his wife on the forehead as she walked out of it. He started doing something in a cupboard.
    
    ‘You should wear the Phil T-shirt to Dad’s funeral,’ he said.
    
    ‘I am going to change,’ I said, and left the room.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    I looked at myself in the half-steamed bathroom mirror. This was the house I grew up in.
    
    The doctor was right about the skin on my chest, just to the right of where I assumed my heart was. It looked all weird.
    
    I picked at the skin. It came away painlessly.
    
    Just a little at first. It made a thick and translucent white flap. I flicked at it with my fingernail. I pulled at it. More pulled away like damp paper. Over my left nipple, then right up to my armpit.
    
    It started to sting a little like it was meant to stay on. I stopped tearing myself. The skin just hung there.
    
    Then I kept going.
    
    I couldn’t walk around with half my chest hanging off me.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Once I’d torn it mostly off, I had an alarmingly large piece of skin in my hands. I looked at it.
    
    It was me but losing its shape, still slightly ridged where it had run over my ribcage.
    
    I looked at my body in the mirror.
    
    There was a long rift where I’d removed the dead skin. It poked outwards, up the side of me, almost imperceptibly, like the unfindable edge of a Sellotape roll.
    
    I didn’t know what to do with the skin that had come off. I couldn’t leave it in the bathroom bin where my brother or his wife would find it. And I didn’t want to flush it, either.
    
    I thought about putting it in my pocket and taking it downstairs and wrapping it in a plastic bag and disposing of it secretly. But that felt insane. And I didn’t want to get caught doing it.
    
    I dropped the skin into the bathtub. It made a slap sound. I turned the showerhead on all the way. I pointed it at the skin. After a moment it began to break apart, as if decomposing, and the tiny pieces of it were carried by the spiralling water down the sloping porcelain, down into the plughole.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    After the funeral, at the wake, which was at the house, my nephew apologised for punching me.
    
    ‘I’m sorry for punching you in your head,’ he said. ‘No problem,’ I said.
    
    ‘I just get so angry sometimes,’ he said.
    
    ‘Right,’ I said.
    
    ‘Don’t you?’ he said.
    
    I poured myself more wine from the bottle I was guarding from everyone else. The new skin was tender under my shirt, under my jacket.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    The living room was large but full of mourners. My uncle by marriage was holding court on refreshments.
    
    ‘Yes, I borrowed it from work,’ he said. ‘From the work canteen.’
    
    He was talking about a large metal urn that stored and dispensed near-boiling water.
    
    ‘I thought a lot of people would want tea,’ my uncle said, ‘and that this would make it easier.’
    
    ‘It must have been hard to get here,’ I said, ‘with all the hot water in.’
    
    ‘What?’ he said.
    
    ‘Imagine if it spilled on someone,’ I said. ‘They’d get all burnt.’
    
    ‘No,’ he said, ‘you don’t transport it full. That’d be dangerous.’
    
    ‘That’s what I’m saying,’ I said.
    
    ‘What are you doing for work at the moment?’ he said. ‘Still writing? Like your parents?’
    
    ‘Yeah,’ I said.
    
    ‘And the money’s alright? I read an article about how books don’t make money anymore. Barely any of you make any money.’
    
    My brother walked over. He was holding a glass of wine and a beer.
    
    ‘I see you have two drinks,’ I said, to him. ‘Nice.’
    
    He tried to hand the beer to my uncle, who put his palms up and made a goofy face, then mimed driving a car.
    
    ‘Thanks for apologising to your nephew,’ my brother said, to me.
    
    ‘I didn’t,’ I said.
    
    ‘He really appreciated it.’
    
    ‘I didn’t apologise. He apologised to me.’
    
    ‘Sure,’ my brother said.
    
    ‘Hey,’ I said. ‘Some of my skin came off earlier.’
    
    My brother was a plastic surgeon. That was his job. ‘What?’ he said.
    
    ‘In the shower. Like a reptile.’
    
    ‘Your skin came off?’
    
    ‘Like a reptile,’ I repeated.
    
    ‘That sounds like eczema. You should see a doctor.’
    
    ‘You are a doctor.’
    
    ‘I’m not a skin doctor.’
    
    ‘You are a skin doctor.’
    
    ‘No, I’m not. I’m a surgeon. I’m not looking at your eczema skin.’
    
    ‘I saw a doctor today,’ I said, ‘and he gave me a cream.’ I tried to pour myself more wine from my bottle but it was empty.
    
    ‘So use the cream,’ my brother said. I walked away to get another drink.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Back in the kitchen, a neighbour from down the road said it had been a beautiful ceremony.
    
    ‘That was a beautiful ceremony,’ she said.
    
    She was older than sixty and wore purple all the time.
    
    Even to funerals.
    
    ‘It was?’ I said.
    
    But she thought I was just agreeing. ‘He would have loved it.’
    
    ‘He would have?’
    
    ‘He would have found it very moving.’
    
    ‘I thought he might have found it disappointing,’ I said, ‘being dead.’
    
    ‘Yes, he would have found it very moving,’ she said. ‘He was a very emotional man. A true artist.’
    
    I thought about my father in the audience of my brother’s school flute recital, holding a biro and the photocopied programme, ticking off each act as it finished.
    
    I thought about my father in the audience of my brother’s school prize-giving, slumped. I thought about him sitting up, suddenly, when a small girl, maybe nine, won an award for ‘dance’. I thought about him saying loudly, incredulously – loud enough for parents to shush him – ‘Darts?’
    
    ‘You knew him pretty well,’ I said.
    
    ‘We had a connection,’ she said. ‘He was a true artist.’ I looked around for a different conversation.
    
    ‘And so kind,’ she said, ‘staying with your mother. After everything.’
    
    I drank the last of my new glass of wine. I put the glass down on the counter hard.
    
    ‘Listen, you stupid purple bitch,’ I said. ‘Shut the fuck up about my dad.’
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    I woke up hungover in my childhood bedroom. I was still wearing my shoes and trousers.
    
    My white shirt had quite a lot of blood on it. My head hurt under my face.
    
    I took my shoes off and went downstairs to make coffee.
    
    My brother’s wife was in the kitchen already.
    
    ‘Coffee?’ I said. I gestured at her with a mug. She didn’t say anything. She just made a sound and left the room.
    
    My brother walked in as she walked out. He kissed her on the forehead as they passed each other.
    
    ‘Got some blood on you,’ he said.
    
    ‘Make me some coffee.’
    
    I sat down at the breakfast island in the middle of the kitchen. The tea urn was gone. But there were glasses and mugs everywhere. The foily remains of wake snacks.
    
    I took my cigarettes out and lit one. ‘Jesus Christ,’ my brother said.
    
    ‘My head hurts,’ I said.
    
    ‘She got you good,’ he said.
    
    ‘I should have hit her back,’ I said.
    
    ‘As if you could,’ he said. ‘She made you look like a little bitch.’
    
    ‘Yeah,’ I said.
    
    ‘You are a little bitch,’ my brother’s wife shouted, from another room.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    I heard my brother and his wife leave to get some air or something. So I called my girlfriend.
    
    It rang once. Then the line went dead. There was no option for voicemail.
    
    I let myself count the days in my head. I had last seen her three weeks ago tomorrow.
    
    Maybe she had blocked my number now.
    
    The wood felt cold and crumb-covered against my forehead.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    My brother drove me and his wife to our mother’s nursing home. My brother’s wife made sure she sat up front so I sat in the back of their car, which was small, but new, and expensive-seeming.
    
    ‘How was the funeral?’ my mother said, from her chair, which was disgusting.
    
    ‘It was beautiful,’ my brother’s wife said. ‘It was a really beautiful ceremony, Rebecca. Everyone said so.’
    
    ‘I’m so glad,’ my mother said.
    
    ‘Have you got everything you need, Mum? Do you need us to bring anything?’ my brother said, louder than necessary. My mother ignored him.
    
    ‘What happened to your face?’ she said.
    
    ‘Cheryl hit me,’ I said.
    
    ‘Why would she do that?’ my mother said.
    
    ‘I was defending Dad’s honour.’
    
    ‘He called her a stupid purple bitch,’ my brother said.
    
    ‘Shut up,’ I said.
    
    ‘Oh, no,’ my mother said.
    
    ‘I didn’t,’ I said.
    
    ‘Oh, no,’ my mother said.
    
    ‘And my skin is peeling off, Mum,’ I said. ‘I’m very frightened.’
    
    ‘What?’ my mother said.
    
    ‘Nothing,’ my brother said. ‘He is just joking. He has some eczema. He is just joking.’
    
    ‘I hope you didn’t hit her back,’ my mother said.
    
    ‘I got her good. Spark out,’ I said. I mimed a jab with my right. ‘Cheryl’s in the hospital.’
    
    ‘Oh, no,’ my mother said.
    
    ‘No, he didn’t,’ my brother’s wife said. ‘He’s just trying to upset you. He didn’t hit her.’
    
    ‘She’s messed up,’ I said. ‘She’ll never look the same.’
    
    ‘Oh, no,’ my mother said.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    ‘Maybe we should just kill Mum,’ I said, in the foyer of the nursing home, as we were leaving. ‘No parents, no rules. Clean break.’
    
    ‘Shut up,’ my brother’s wife said.
    
    ‘What did you say the advance on your book was?’ my brother said.
    
    He meant my second book, the book I had told everyone I was writing, and got paid an advance on.
    
    I had told everyone it was about an elderly gardener. The gardener lives near Chernobyl, in Soviet times.
    
    The gardener dies because he’s so old. In the middle of the gardener’s funeral rites, the nearby power plant explodes. The funeral is abandoned halfway through.
    
    The gardener becomes a dybbuk, which was a kind of Jewish ghost I’d seen in a movie. He has to wander around the Earth endlessly, gardening or something, until something gets sorted out.
    
    That was as far as I’d gotten. I hadn’t actually written any of it yet.
    
    I had tried. But every time I tried I just didn’t. ‘Fifty five thou,’ I said. ‘Clean, non-sequential bills.’ ‘Fucking hell,’ my brother said.
    
    ‘That’s wonderful news,’ my brother’s wife said, ‘congratulations. You won’t need to be in London. You can help get the house in order. For the sale.’
    
    ‘Yes, good idea,’ I said, thinking about not having to pay rent anymore.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    It was the autumn and there were leaves everywhere. I decided to go back to London to get things. On the train I sat facing the wrong direction and looked out the window. The air was full of rain. I was carried backwards into it.
    
    In my flat the furniture was still there. The sofa, the television, the stereo, the gifted soft-furnishings.
    
    But when I opened the wardrobe to get a clean jumper it was empty. Or, two-thirds empty. All my girlfriend’s things had disappeared. Her dresses, blouses, skirts. Her floating light-fabricked trousers. Her multiple, heavy winter coats. I went to the dresser and checked the drawers that belonged to her.
    
    But they were empty, too. All that was left was lint, and the decrepit sprigs of lavender she believed would ward off moths.
    
    Then I noticed the bookshelves. They were also mainly empty. So was the bathroom. All the stupid and expensive houseplants had disappeared.
    
    I was surprised at how few of the things we owned together belonged to me. There were outlines of dust all around the places her things used to live.
    
    The air smelt different somehow.
    
    I looked around for a note or something. But there wasn’t one. So I tried calling her phone again and it rang once and then went silent.
    
    I went out onto the balcony for a while. The sun was setting grey.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    When I woke, it felt like someone was watching me.
    
    I sat up in bed for a second. Then I turned on the lights. But there was nobody in the room. And the curtains were closed.
    
    I noticed that in my sleep I’d built a person out of pillows next to me. Maybe so it felt as if she was still in the bed.
    
    I could feel my heart pushing my chest.
    
    When I couldn’t get back to sleep I dressed and had a drink. My girlfriend had taken some of the wine but left the spirits. After that I felt a bit better.
    
    I started packing possessions into the suitcase she hadn’t taken. It was the ugliest one. We had named it ‘Ugly Green’.
    
    By the time dawn was done I was ready to leave. I wrote an email on my phone to the estate agent saying we were vacating the flat; that they could dispose of the remaining contents, at our expense, as they saw fit.
    
    Then I tried calling her again. But it rang out.
    
    I rolled Ugly Green to the door. I turned around and began to wipe the dust outlines of her possessions from the shelves and counters and other furniture surfaces. But then I decided I did not feel like it. So I gave up.
    
    The train back to the house was half-filled with commuters, in various states of rained-on, all umbrellas and ugly laptops. They thinned out as we got further out of the city, until I was alone, in the train carriage, in the countryside.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    From the outside, once I was back at it, the house looked very empty.
    
    The plants around it seemed to have gotten bigger.
    
    There were vines growing up one of the walls. They were almost touching the glass of a ground floor window.
    
    My key was loud in the door. Nobody shouted hello.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    In the bathroom, I picked at the skin on my hand. It felt dry and funny.
    
    The skin pulled upwards, from my wrist, all the way from my palms and fingers, and then across the back of my hand. I just kept pulling, until it had come away from all my fingers and shifting hand veins. The skin came away in a single piece. It didn’t hurt. I looked at it. It looked like a glove of myself.
    
    I threw the skin into the bathtub. I turned the showerhead on and aimed at the skin and watched as it disintegrated and was carried down the drain.
    
    My brother and his wife were back in their big and increasingly valuable house in London. So I was alone in this one.
    
    It was mid-afternoon. I got drunk. Then I went to bed and slept dreamlessly.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    It was almost afternoon again. I was not sure how I had slept so long.
    
    I wrote a message to my brother and his wife to confirm that I would be living in the house, ostensibly to help clear it out for the sale.
    
    I did not want to do that. But saying it would make them feel okay with me living in the house.
    
    After I wrote that message I looked at Twitter. My girlfriend had a new story out. In Guernica. She still had me blocked. But the story was all over everyone else’s Twitters. So I saw it anyway. Everyone was calling the story excellent, dark, funny, astute, etc.
    
    I opened my laptop to look at it on there. I scrolled all the way to the bottom.
    
    I didn’t recognise her new author photo. Her hair was shorter than it was. Beside the photo it said: Kei Kagirinaku is a writer from London.
    
    Downstairs, I heard the television say: the magnetic North Pole is moving increasingly towards Siberia, away from Canada. I didn’t remember turning it on.

    "text": "It was so hot that the air in the room seemed to have solidified overnight. Vera must have forgotten to set the fan running before she went to bed. Or had she tried to cook again when she got in? Her head pounded and her breathing scratched like she’d got through five packs of cigarettes, which was unfair because she didn’t smoke, not even when she was soused. Everything in the apartment glowered black and orange. Vera reached for the half empty glass of water on the other side of the bed, the only evidence that Ed had slept over. She was grateful that he wouldn’t see her like this. There are some levels of fame where everyone you date is a fan without having properly noticed you – you were just always there, already familiar.

    Her heels ached in the fluffy kitten-heel mules so she kicked them off, retrieving her secret slippers from under the bed, the ones that dragged along the floor like mutt’s ears. What this hangover needed was a Bloody Mary. Funny that Ed didn’t stay. He didn’t have work today. There was no ice in the icebox. Did it make one an alcoholic if you went and mixed one up anyway? Her drink tasted like a fortified gazpacho, but the tabasco would surely help revive her sore throat.
    
    She glanced at the hallway mirror on her way back to bed and gasped, her tumbler shattering on the terracotta tiles. Incredibly, where her neck had once been, she could now see right through to the faded paisley paper on the opposite wall. There was nothing between her chin and her shoulders. Trembling, she felt behind her chin and the skin was smooth, as if her head were a pig-skin ball. No need for tabasco, her throat had cleared.

    As Vera opened the door, Valentino skittered noisily over the imitation marble floor to meet her, sounding as if a necklace had burst with its beads rolling in every direction. No matter how polished the surroundings, you could never displace the smell of dog: dust, muck, and jelly. She rubbed his ears fondly. The designer entered from behind a velvet drape, pins held perilously between her teeth, shooing Valentino from the room.
    
    ‘Angel,’ she said, spitting out pins, ‘is it possible you’ve gotten even thinner?’ She briskly kissed the air by Vera’s ears and gestured for her to get undressed. The costumes for the Army Christmas Musical were hanging on a rail. Vera smiled as the designer pulled up the hem of a skirt to show her the stitching, sighing in pleasure as the pink chiffon floated lazily back to the ground. Looking through the other pieces, Vera gave an involuntary shudder at the white fur-trimmed red hat and cape; she hated Christmas in LA. A reminder: must phone mother later. Vera felt a dryness in her throat and gulped. She would send her mother a postcard.
    
    Vera gave a little growl and pulled away as hands reached out to untie her scarf. The designer pushed blue-tinted shades up onto her head, lit two cigarettes and held one out, waiting, ‘Did a boyfriend of yours hurt you?’ The designer (or Ms Edie in such intimate moments) understood silence as confession. ‘You know pancake can cover that. I’ll bell Dolly and have her bring some over right now. What shade are you? Twilight Tandem? Ivory Novella?’ Vera sighed like a rattlesnake and unwound her ugly scarf. She had expected the designer to faint or to scream, instead she replaced the telephone receiver calmly back on its cradle. ‘Well, Angel’ she said, gesturing at the rail of costumes, ‘these are all going to have to be redone. Thank goodness you look cute in a turtleneck!’

    Idling at the lights on Western Avenue, Vera gripped the steering wheel one-handed, the other holding an orange popsicle (lunch) that was dribbling onto her bare thighs. Just as she was about to move off a convertible screeched across the junction, manned by an invisible driver. It would have seemed like a textbook joyride, were it not for the car’s handsome passenger, familiar from the fan magazines and her boudoir the night before. What was Ed doing, laughing gaily as some jailbait hussy hurtled him round LA? Instinctively she threw the popsicle stick out of the window and followed. She and Ed weren’t ‘exclusive’ but if he was getting mixed up with delinquent kids, she didn’t have the stomach to see him anymore. No matter how useful he might be to her career. She hoped it wasn’t that.
    
    After the junction dash her quarry slowed to a canoodle. Vera bit her lip as Ed leaned down to caress the driver. How long had this been going on?
    
    ‘I make a lousy PI, but they’re so busy with each other that they’ll not notice me,’ mouthed Vera brightly to a ghost camera. Ed and his companion pulled up to a fashionable restaurant in Rodeo Drive. She felt a tug in her chest. He could have called or left a note. They had been together only last night. Had she been neglecting him so badly with the rehearsals? Ed walked round to the driver’s side door to open it and Vera almost crashed as she saw her neck hop out, wearing nothing but her grandmother’s stolen pearls.
    
     
    
    –
     
    Vera licked the salt off her asparagus and laid it neatly back on the plate. The maître d’ was laughing at something witty her neck had said, his gold tooth flashing in the sun. Although technically she was a wronged woman, she felt despicable spying on Ed like this. He looked relaxed and happy for once. Vera shaped the complimentary bread into pathetic cannonballs, stacking them up on the off-white table linen. When had they grown close? Tête-à-têtes while Vera slept? Stolen glances while she was in the shower?
    
    Her neck did a sensual little shimmy as a fluorescent lobster was set down on its plate. Ed picked up the lobster crackers and – crack! He tugged out pale-pink quivering flesh from the lobster’s claws – crack! Tossed each piece in the air and her neck caught them like a seal – crack! Ed was applauding – crack! The band started playing something frenzied. Now they were dancing! Ed was dancing. Ed! Who had always refused to dance with Vera because she was a pro. Vera stood up, bringing the tablecloth with her. The smashed crockery drew the attention of the whole restaurant. Blinkered by rage she strode towards the couple but found herself being pinned across the chest by hoodlums who had materialised from nowhere. She reached towards her neck, which gulped unmistakably then said with a phony Brooklyn accent, ‘Kindly remove this broad, I have never seen her before in my life!’
    
     
    
    –
     
    Isn’t there anything else we can do? Wrote Vera on the large notepad she now carried with her (accidentally starting a minor trend for oversized handbags).
    
    ‘Thing is,’ said LG, ‘Your neck has probably found herself a smart lawyer willing to argue that she’s not under contract to us, even if you are. Hell, she’ll probably say you forced her to work for years against her will.’
    
    Will you be replacing me in the army Christmas musical? Wrote Vera, unable to look up from the carpet.
    
    ‘With that pretty waist and those dainty hooves?! Don’t be crazy! Of course, I can’t see into the future and there may be, um, casting issues if this separation becomes permanent or word gets out about your, um, accident.’ He shrugged, stubbing his cigar out on Mary Pickford’s ceramic cheek.
    
     
    
    –
     
    Sat in her trailer, Vera iced her bloody toes. Filming had begun on the Army Christmas Musical. The designer had worked miracles with the costumes, each of them cleverly covering the well-proportioned absence between her chin and shoulders. This lack of flesh might have troubled the punters, but thankfully her co-star Rosie could fulfil the promise of a plunging neckline, and Vera was contributing a lot of leg to create visual balance. Flicking through the latest issue of Life while she waited for hair and make-up, she came across a striking full-length portrait of the neck, posed against draped satin with a worldly and sexually confident air. It was a shock to see it looking like that. When they had been together Vera’s image had been much more bobby socks and strong white teeth. Had her designer agreed to style it? Of course she had.
    
    The neck was causing a big sensation. Apparently, all the studio bosses were ringing the neck and begging it to go to expensive restaurants to discuss its career. The neck gave an interview saying that ‘musicals were dead.’ It had recently enrolled in the Actors Studio on the advice of its new friend Marlon, hoping to make an appearance in ‘something serious’ on Broadway. It had signed with United Artists. With typical consideration for others, Vera threw up in the wastepaper basket.
    
     
    
    –
     
    The most pressing question asked about the trial was who was dressed better for court. The neck had donned a demure black veil and the faintest scent of orange blossom for the occasion. Vera wished her hair a shade less ‘showgirl’ and her showgirl legs a shade less hidden by the stand. Both studios agreed that the trial was good business either way. The cat was out of the bag that the neck causing a big sensation was formerly Vera’s. Hollywood is a small town of velvet curtain-twitchers.
    
    An enthusiastic member of the Malibu Harlequins Amateur Dramatic Society, the judge demanded ‘ocular proof’ of the complainant’s abandonment. Vera unwound her scarf, moving slowly, as if pinching the tip of each finger in turn to remove long satin gloves. She heard the courthouse hold its breath, then gasp. Vera smiled reassuringly. Camera bulbs flashed.
    
    ‘It’s a trick!’ blurted a poxy youth. Frowning, the judge shuffled over to Vera and asked, ‘May I?’ passing his hand through the gap between her head and her neck, like a magician. ‘Remarkable,’ he muttered as he went back to his seat.
    
    In its defence, the neck complained bitterly of being forced to work a punishing schedule for no remuneration, of being dressed in cheap jewellery which stained it green, and fondled by the hairy fingers of studio executives. Vera’s feet would be next to skip out on her, it warned.
    
    This was all undeniably true. we were a team wrote Vera, eyes brimming pink. The neck turned away.
    
    The judge ruled in favour of the neck. It wanted its independence and had proved itself capable of gaining employment, a fiancé (Ed grinned down from the balcony), and a name for itself (Barbara Lee) in a short space of time. This was the land of the free after all. It would be wrong to force an ‘association’ which made the neck unhappy.
    
    Vera left the courthouse on LG’s arm. Rosie, Danny, and Bing, her co-stars in the Army Christmas Musical, were signing autographs, with Danny doing comical impressions of the judge, and sometimes Vera. Across the courthouse steps the neck was giving interviews, nestled comfortably against Ed’s firm chest.
    
    Moving as fast as it is possible in stilettos and a pencil skirt, Vera lunged. Grabbing it round the middle, she attempted to force the neck back on the smooth stump between her shoulders.
    
    ‘Cut it out Vera, you’re choking her!’ screamed Ed, ripping Vera’s hands away from his lover. The neck fell to the ground pitifully and Vera, blinded by tears, howled in pain.
    
     
    
    –
     
    It was horribly hot in the room. Vera felt around with her feet for her slippers; toes connecting with fur, she padded into the kitchenette. She knew that despite everything being the way it was, she wouldn’t go back home to mother. Even with a hit song, the Army Christmas Musical would probably sink like a body rolled into the reservoir. The neck was right, musicals were dead. Pulling on a mint-coloured dressing gown she went to unlock the mailbox. On principle, Vera refused to wear something that covered the gap between her head and shoulders when at home. Her neighbours were used to the sight of her head levitating above the communal swimming pool like a golden dragonfly.
    
    There was a postcard from her cousin Kate, a few items of probable fan mail, and an official-looking envelope bearing her typewritten full legal name. Vera sliced it open with a manicured nail. It was a letter from United Artists forbidding her from being on the lot at the same time as the neck. She sat down on a sun lounger and lit a cigarette. Her feet twitched.

    The girl runs in and hangs her leather bag on the hook. She pulls an apron on over her cashmere sweater, rolls up her sleeves and ties her blonde hair back into a ponytail.
    
    ‘Late again!’ her dad bellows from the kitchen. ‘One crab stick for the young black fella outside the takeaway window.’ The boy and his kind do not eat inside the cafe.
    
    She grabs the crab stick from the galley counter. It is lukewarm. Like always, she discreetly throws a few hot chips into the bottom of the bag, free of charge, and delivers it to the boy. He is sitting on a stump, drinking a hot cup of Milo. She tries not to make eye contact with him as she delivers the food.
    
    Later, the girl glances up from the fryer to check out the boy when she thinks he is not looking. She takes in the broadness of his shoulders and the tattoo of the crayfish on his arm. He wears a leather necklace of shark teeth around his neck. The wet sheen of his dark brown skin sparkles in the morning sun. Fine grains of white beach sand coat his legs and bare feet. His bodyboard is leaning on the gum tree behind him. He flicks the black curls from his eyes and scans the ocean. She is captivated by the warm, earthy hue of his soulful eyes. He meets her gaze and smiles. She quickly looks away, feeling a flush of warmth rise to her cheeks.
    
    As she drains the oil from the battered lobster tails, the girl thinks about how they charge ten times the price for a lobster roll compared to a crab stick. Lobster rolls come smothered in truffle mayo and kale slaw in a brioche bun. But, to her, lobster tastes the same as a crab stick. Her dad won’t let her eat crab sticks. They are bad for you, he says. She tries one anyway. The boy is one of the only customers who consistently orders the crab sticks.
    
    She looks outside. The boy is still there. He is surrounded by seagulls. They clamour for his chips. At a table next to the boy is a group of surfers. She has seen them before. They are out-of-town fly-in-fly-out mining workers, down from a swing. She watches as they walk back and forth to their shiny new four-wheel drives, tying their custom-made boards to the racks.
    
    The girl delivers the lobster rolls to the surfers. Her dad says they are on the house. The surfers stuff the lobster rolls into their mouths with their filthy hands, and chew with their mouths open. She looks away in disgust. They turn their attention to the surfing footage they have captured on their action cameras.
    
    ‘Would you like a lobster roll, too?’ she asks the boy. She has intentionally made an extra one.
    
    ‘No, thanks. My totem animal is the gilgie, a fresh-water cray. Lobsters are a bit like gilgies, so I won’t eat them. We don’t eat our totem animals.’
    
    ‘Fair enough,’ she says. ‘I’ll bring you some more crab sticks, then. They’re made of fish, you know. Not crabs.’
    
    ‘Totem animals! What a load of shit. It’s lobster, mate. Winners like us eat lobsters,’ says the man next to him.
    
    The girl rolls her eyes and looks out at the ocean.
    
    ‘The swell’s backing off now,’ she mutters to no one in particular.
    
    ‘It was going off this morning,’ says one of the surfers.
    
    ‘Yep, that’s just how it is,’ says another. The others nod in agreement.
    
    ‘It’s because the moon affects the tides,’ says the boy. The surfers turn their attention to him, as if they have never seen the boy before. It is the first time she has heard the boy speak to them.
    
    ‘So, you think you’re smart?’
    
    The boy doesn’t respond.
    
    ‘Mate, going to school and having smarts will get you nothin’ in life. Busting your gut up in the red dirt like us is the only way you’ll make a decent buck these days.’
    
    After her mum died of cancer, the girl was forced to quit school to help her dad out in his cafe. She wonders how the moon affects the tides, and how the tides affect the waves. Who controls the moon?
    
     
    
    The next day, the girl arrives at work with her father and there are a group of tourists waiting to enter the cafe for breakfast. She watches as they pose in front of the wall mural and wonders if they are influencers. The artwork is called The Natives, a fresco of Aboriginal people drinking beer around a campfire with native animals – kangaroos, emus, numbats, black cockatoos. As the girl rushes past to unlock the door, she hears one of them say, ‘Post it to your story!’
    
    The boy and the surfers come in from the ocean.
    
    ‘What’s with the esky lid, grom?’ the surfers taunt the boy, pointing to his bodyboard.
    
    ‘Found it on the beach.’
    
    ‘Stole it, more like it.’
    
    ‘You’re not a real surfer,’ says another. ‘Better watch your back in the line up. If you drop in on us, we’ll shred your esky lid up with our fins.’ The surfers howl with laughter and throw his bodyboard over the railing.
    
    The girl runs outside and watches as the boy sprints down the dune towards his bodyboard. It has landed on the rocks below.
    
    By the time the boy returns, the surfers have diverted their attention back to their cameras. The boy inspects his board, and she can see a large crack in the foam. He looks dismayed and sighs. She runs inside to get some duct tape and hands it to him.
    
    ‘Thanks, but I’m gonna let it dry out for a bit then I’ll patch it up with some glue,’ he says. ‘It’s not the first time this has happened.’ She lightly traces the intricate web of repaired cracks in his board.
    
    ‘Some of the cracks are caused by me. The sea can get rough. I normally throw a handful of sand into the ocean before a session, so the Waugul comes down to protect me whilst I’m out there.’
    
    ‘I’ve seen you do that.’
    
    ‘You been watching me?’ he asks, teasingly.
    
    She nods.
    
    ‘Solid,’ he says, with a wink.
    
    ‘You know, you should report them to the police if they keep harassing you,’ she says in a low voice, gesturing towards the surfers.
    
    ‘I want to be a cop one day,’ he says.
    
    ‘For real?’
    
    ‘Yep. I want to help my people from the inside. They think I’m a traitor for wanting to be a cop. They say I’m too wadjela – too white.’
    
    ‘I want to be Taylor Swift,’ she says wistfully. The boy laughs at this.
    
    ‘That’s deadly,’ he says.
    
    ‘Oi! Get away from that boy and get your arse back in the kitchen!’ her dad yells.
    
    ‘Sorry,’ the girl mouths silently at the boy as she skulks back inside.
    
    The next day, the boy doesn’t turn up. Or the day after. Or the day after that. Each day the girl arrives and looks over at his empty stump stool with disappointment. She scans the waves and the beach for the boy. He is nowhere to be seen but hiding in every corner of her mind.
    
    A couple of weeks later, the girl visits her local library. She searches for books on bush tucker food. She wants to convince her dad to revise the cafe menu to include saltbush and lemon myrtle calamari, wallaby dumplings and wattle seed damper.
    
    As she searches for the books, she’s surprised to find the boy sitting at a nearby desk. She watches him quietly for a short moment, before finding her voice.
    
    ‘Hey, Gilgie,’ she says, tentatively.
    
    ‘Kaya! That means hello in Noongar language.’
    
    ‘Kaya. I haven’t seen you around the cafe lately.’
    
    ‘Nah, I’ve been studying for exams.’ He stands up to join her next to the bookshelf.
    
    ‘What are you looking for?’ he asks, looking at the shelf behind her.
    
    ‘Bush tucker books.’
    
    He leans over her and pulls a book from the shelf. ‘What about this one?’
    
    He is so close now she can smell the woody scent of his deodorant, and the watermelon vape on his breath. She watches the steady pulse of his jugular vein and imagines what it would feel like to kiss his neck.
    
    ‘I got you something,’ he says.
    
    ‘Me?’
    
    ‘Yeah, I was gonna give it to you after exams, but since you’re here I can give it to you now.’ He reaches into his backpack and pulls out a friendship bracelet. The beads spell out the word F.E.A.R.L.E.S.S.
    
    His hand touches hers as he gives her the bracelet. An electric current shoots up her arm. He leaves his hand there for a moment. It feels warm and soft like a cozy blanket on a chilly day.
    
    ‘Coz you’re a Swiftie!’ he says.
    
    ‘Thank you. I love it,’ she says as she puts it on her wrist. She sleeps with it on that night. She never takes it off.
    
    The girl waits forever for the boy to return to the cafe. She wonders how many exams he has. When she thinks about him, the sun shines brighter, the salt air feels crisper, the beach daisies look more yellow. She wears a push up bra and a low-cut top, much to the admiration of the surfers. But it is not their attention she seeks. She paints her nails bright pink, applies lipstick every day and plays Taylor Swift music loudly. She sings the words ‘But with you I’d dance in a storm / In my best dress / Fearless!’
    
    ‘Turn that shit down!’ her father shouts.
    
    Finally, she sees the boy walking up the beach stairs. He is smiling straight at her.
    
    ‘Oh, look! The prodigal esky lidder has returned,’ a surfer jibes, ditching a plastic bottle at him.
    
    The boy ignores the surfer without breaking eye contact with the girl.
    
    ‘Hey, Swiftie.’
    
    ‘Kaya, Gilgie.’
    
    ‘Exams are done.’
    
    ‘Great! How do you think they went?’
    
    ‘I think I did alright. I also applied for a cadet traineeship with the Western Australian Police.’
    
    ‘Wow, that’s awesome. It’s good to see you again.’
    
    ‘You too. You’re still wearing the bracelet I gave you.’
    
    ‘Yeah.’ She coyly twists the bracelet around her wrist and looks up at the boy. He is looking down at the bracelet with a lopsided grin. She watches as his gaze veers to her chest.
    
    A thunderstorm is rolling in. Lightning flashes across the horizon. The sky darkens and rumbles. A curlew takes flight, filling the air with a haunting wail. She must get the chairs and tables inside.
    
    ‘Oi! Grom! Come ‘ere,’ a surfer calls out. The boy looks around and hesitantly makes his way over to the group.
    
    ‘Sit down and have a lobster roll with us,’ the man instructs.
    
    ‘No, thank you,’ the boy responds, keeping his eyes fixed to the ground. The man ignores him and tells the girl to make another lobster roll. The girl starts frying up some crab sticks instead of lobster tails. She keeps a watchful eye on them.
    
    As she delivers the lobster roll to the table, she subtly nods to the boy. She is not sure he understands she has swapped the filling to crab.
    
    ‘Eat it,’ instructs the man. The boy brings the roll to his mouth and hesitates.
    
    ‘What, you don’t like lobster?’ the man says with a smirk.
    
    ‘EAT, EAT, EAT,’ the surfers chant, banging their fists on the table.
    
    ‘I said eat it!’ the man yells as he smashes the roll into the boy’s face. Bits of crab stick, kale slaw and brioche bread fly across the table. The seagulls swoop down fighting for the scraps.
    
    ‘Wait, what the hell is this?’ the man asks, picking up a piece of crab stick. The man glances across at the girl in the kitchen.
    
    ‘Righto, let’s step it up,’ he says turning back to the boy. ‘Time for you to go for a swim!’ The surfers jeer as they carry the boy down the beach stairs towards the ocean.
    
    The girl runs out of the kitchen and follows them. A gale whips at her dress. Her hair lashes her cheeks. The sand stings her legs.
    
    ‘Let him go! He’ll die out there!’ she screams. They ignore her, pushing the boy and a surfboard into a dinghy with them. Amidst the roar of the wind and crash of waves, she can hear the boy protesting. She momentarily watches from beneath the shelter of a limestone cliff until they are out past the steep crest line of waves, bereft that she cannot help him. She runs back up to the cafe to tell her dad what has happened. He shrugs and flips another burger. ‘Get back to work,’ he says. She calls the police, then runs back down to the beach.
    
    Minutes later, the dinghy returns to shore with the surfers but no boy. She imagines him out there by himself. The fury of the ocean. Sharks. Her tears mix with the rain and salt spray, and she cannot tell the difference. She throws a handful of sand into the sea.
    
    ‘Gilgie!’ The wind drowns out her voice.
    
     
    
    Days turn into weeks. The girl surveys the ocean for signs of the boy. She walks along the shoreline looking for broken pieces of board. There is nothing. Nobody notices the boy is gone. It’s as if he didn’t exist. She grieves for him. The surfers come and go, eating their lobster rolls. She paints over the mural.
    
    ‘I’m leaving. I’m going back to school,’ she tells her father one day. ‘And I’m going to sing,’ she adds.
    
    ‘Fair dinkum. You’ve got rocks in your head, girl.’
    
    She ignores him.
    
    ‘I don’t want to cook lobsters anymore. Their numbers are declining, and we’re destroying their habitat. It just doesn’t feel right anymore.’
    
    Her father looks bewildered. She leaves and doesn’t look back.
    
    After school one day, the girl walks through the hospital wards, pausing now and then to serenade the patients with songs. This is her new job. Her eyes fall on a familiar tattoo etched onto the arm of a patient. A small crayfish.
    
    ‘Gilgie?’ she calls out to him.
    
    ‘Swiftie!’
    
    ‘You’re alive!’ She reaches down and embraces him. He winces and she takes a step back, afraid that she has hurt him.
    
    ‘The Waugul saved me,’ he declares. ‘The Rainbow Serpent.’
    
    ‘For real?’ she asks, imagining the giant, colourful sea-snake carrying Gilgie safely to shore. ‘Are you okay?’
    
    ‘Yeah. Feeling a bit crook. Broke my leg and hit my head. I was in a coma. Still got a bit of a headache, aye.’
    
    ‘I’m just glad you’re alive, Gilgie.’
    
    ‘It’s Ethan. My wadjela name is Ethan.’
    
    ‘I’m Grace.’
    
    An awkward pause settles between them as they stare at each other like they are meeting for the first time. No longer under the sharp shadows of others. Free of the weight of histories untold. She sees only the soft glow of possibilities now.
    
    ‘Would you like me to bring you some crab sticks tomorrow?’ she asks him.
    
    A smile spreads across his face.
    
    ‘I reckon scallops might be better from now on. If that’s okay? Will you share them with me?’
    
    Grace loves the delicate sweetness of scallops. They are pricier than crab sticks, but he is worth it.
    
    ‘Absolutely. I’d love that, Gilgie. I’ll bring you scallops every day, if you want. Whatever you need to help you heal, just let me know.’
    
    ‘Just you, Grace. I just need you.’
    
    She leans down and kisses him gently. Sealing the beginning of their journey together. Carrying the legacy of their two worlds. Bound by love and hope.

    "text": "‘There goes dinner,’ Nina says.

She stares at the broken shards on the floor. Was it hand-painted? Nina wonders, admiring her own plate – part of the same set. The blue brushstrokes against the white ceramic, the flower in the centre and the figs dancing along the rim. Must have been.

She massages her temples before surveying the table. Emma, at one end, returns her stare, though their camaraderie – if there ever was any – is long gone. Aldo, at the other, scratches at the glass table with his finger and mutters to himself, words somewhere between fuck and stupid and respect. Toby’s vacant stare falls on the rolling Tuscan landscape.

This is supposed to be a holiday, but even here, Nina is languishing, withering. Dread crawls across her chest, wrapping its long claws around her back. She’s been forcing herself out of bed these past few months, and it’s been the same here, out and on to the poolside lounger. Poor Nina.

‘I want to go home,’ Nina announces, though no one responds.

At home, Nina knows how to tweeze the rot from her heart. Singing with Ramon, a twenty-one-year-old with a handlebar moustache who sits up so straight it’s as if his spine is a maestro’s baton, and who’s raised her vocal range by five notes and her spirits an octave. Throwing clay at the pottery studio near her flat. Hugging her nephew, each roll in his fat little arms like a crease in a boiled dumpling. But she’s stuck here in Florence, at the silent dinner table, staring at the broken plate on the floor.

She looks out at the enormous cypress trees lining the thick wall of Aldo’s parents’ holiday home, and behind them the Florentine hills. No, Nina is trapped. No Ramon, no nephew and no clay, unless she sticks her hands into the dirt, but why would she do that? Her manicure cost forty pounds.

Toby fiddles with his fork, prodding at the tines, and then moves it across the glass to poke Nina’s knife, disrupting the parallel lines of her cutlery. His playful gesture annoys her. Is he insane? He used to call her beautiful, used to kiss her breasts, lick her nipples, rub his face along her upper thigh. He said it so often that after a while Nina believed him. Now, she doesn’t really care what he thinks, or tries her best not to.

Nina and Toby were never that serious. They never had conversations about not sleeping with other people. For that, Nina feels both disappointed and unentitled to that disappointment. Nina can’t bear it. The animus, the cracked plate, Aldo and Emma’s ugly faces, Toby’s pretty one. Just as she’s about to combust, the oven dings. The lasagne.

She rises, her wooden chair scraping against the sandstone tile, and walks inside the house – too modern, a little gaudy – to take the dish out of the oven. She lets it rest on the counter while she finds a dustpan and brush beneath the marble sink.

When Nina returns, Toby tries to help her, or perhaps more accurately, crouches beside her as she sweeps. Rather than relieving her of her tools – actually being useful – he fiddles with a fragment, picking it up running his finger along the broken edge.

‘Ow!’

Toby drops the shard, which cracks into two.

‘Are you okay?’ Emma asks, pushing back from her chair, a desperate rumble vibrating off its legs.

‘I’m fine,’ he says.

All for show, Nina thinks as she draws the debris into the dustpan. All for fucking show.

As Toby latches on to his finger, attempting to suck the wound dry, Nina notices the drop of blood now staining his white trousers. She feels a hollowing out and her mind drags her back to the drop of blood she once saw on his sheets.

‘What’s this?’ Nina had asked, still naked, pointing to the round stain pressed into the linen.

‘Oh, it’s um . . .’ Toby had mumbled. ‘I’m sorry.’

With that apology, Nina plummeted.

‘Whose is it?’

‘It’s . . . I don’t know,’ Toby said, because he didn’t. ‘Sorry.’

Why didn’t he just lie?  Say that he scratched a scab in his sleep. He could’ve said something else – anything else – but sorry. Nina imagined Toby having sex with a woman who wasn’t her. Fucking her on the bed, on her period, leaving a spot of blood behind and caring too little to change the sheets before he next saw Nina.

‘Are you upset?’ Toby had asked.

‘I’m upset.’

‘But—’

‘I know, Toby.’

With that, she’d left his flat, her body swollen with regret. Regret for failing to keep it to herself, for asking questions she didn’t want the answer to. When Nina first learned that Toby had started sleeping with Emma, Nina was reminded that she was the architect of her own suffering.

‘It couldn’t be less serious,’ Emma had said.

Nina acted as if she didn’t care – she was a fool who swallowed her own reality whole.

Why does Nina do this? Circle her own life like a vulture. She thought she’d healed, at least enough to be on holiday with him. And with her. But Toby’s a fucking child. She hates him! She does. But when he releases his finger from his mouth to look at it, it’s with an innocence that charms from her a desire to kiss it better, to consume him, but only for a moment before the anger returns. She shakes her head, and he turns his face as if she slapped him.

Nina takes the shards inside, and Toby follows two steps behind her. She hears her therapist in her head: sit with the emotion, examine it, question if there are other places you have felt it.

Do I love him or the idea of him? Nina asks herself. Or are they the same?

‘I’m sorry,’ Toby says to Nina in the kitchen.

Nina ignores him, sweeping the debris into the bin, and when Toby moves to touch her shoulder she jerks it toward her neck. His hand recoils and Toby feels a puncture he can’t locate. He retreats to the bathroom in the far recesses of the house, beyond what the glass walls expose to the table outside.

 

Toby shakes his hand, a perfect circle of blood falling on the tiles. He mummifies his finger in toilet paper before rifling through the cabinet beneath the sink. He finds a plaster, taking longer than he needs to. All he wants to do is buy some time, minutes away from people who pair forgiveness with resentment. Nobody hates him more than Aldo, still angry that Toby followed his dreams while Aldo couldn’t hack it – always spewing big talk at Toby about how he wants to be a provider, which makes Toby angry but also makes him want to laugh, because Aldo’s wife fucking left him.

Provide for whom? Fucking moron.

Sitting on the toilet, he thinks about Nina. He really liked Nina. Still likes, even. And he followed the rules, in that there weren’t many rules, and if someone else doesn’t set the rules then how can he follow them?

One night they watched a movie called Boiling Point, set in a restaurant near his flat in Hackney. He remembers a female patron saying that sex was like food, you work with what’s there, not with what’s not, and how he and Nina laughed. Nina’s body had been different to other women he’d slept with, but it was pleasurable all the same. With Nina, Toby wasn’t in search of just sensation, but of feeling, too, and that scared him. It scared him so much that when he thought about how sex was like food, he questioned if what the woman in that movie should’ve said is that no cuisine offers everything you want, which means dipping your cock into as many cuisines as possible.

So he began to fuck around, even though he knew Nina wasn’t, and no matter how much he ate he found himself hungry. Even when he was with Emma, the difference in Emma’s body didn’t feel as great as he’d hoped, lovely as it was, and it scared him again, to know, undeniably, that for him Nina was much more than sex.

When Nina had asked him about the blood on his sheets, Toby watched something in her crack. He felt guilty. He wasn’t lying – if he’d hazarded a guess it would’ve only been with the certainty attained from a balance of probabilities – but he felt wrong, and even worse for knowing the blood could’ve been Emma’s.

Emma told Nina that she was sleeping with Toby, though only sometime after Toby and Nina had ended things, and with no indication of the overlap between them.

‘She seemed fine,’ Emma said to Toby.

This both surprised and disappointed him, and so he chose not to believe it.

Emma and Toby didn’t last long. The guilt ate at Toby – it eats at him right now. He hates himself – a lot – for being the kind of person people say he is. Can’t prioritise, can’t think about other people. Can’t promise, because promising means disappointing people, means falling short. Nina once said that when we act from a place of fear, we secure the outcomes we were trying to avoid in the first place. Toby thinks about that a lot, about how much he loses because he’s a coward.

Clearly, he doesn’t lose enough. Nina is here. Emma is here. Everyone forgives him. They forgive his lack of promises and accept his vague attempts to do better. And maybe if they look hard enough, Toby is doing better, but he knows that people will always wait, and that strips the journey of urgency. Maybe if he’d been honest, about sleeping with Emma, about the overlap, then none of them would be here. The plate would’ve stayed intact, untouched in the kitchen cabinet, and they could’ve each dealt with their broken selves much closer to home. But Nina would’ve been so hurt, even if she’d try her best to hide it, and Toby hadn’t wanted to do that to her. Honesty would’ve lost her, right?

Toby notices that the plaster has soaked through with blood. He replaces it with a larger one before walking back through the house. Emma’s glare is on him as he comes into view from behind the glass doors. It’s as if she could see him through the walls, wrapping his finger in the bathroom. Before this evening, before the batshit drama, Toby had thought it was wonderful that he could be on holiday with Emma and Nina, and for everything to be okay. Silly, really.

‘Are you okay?’ Nina asks, still in the kitchen.

Toby nods, holding up his wrapped finger.

‘You?’

‘No, Toby.’

 

From outside, Emma watches the movement in Toby’s jaw, unable to discern his words. She knows he’s talking to Nina, even though she’s hidden behind the curtain. She turns to Aldo, who scowls at the horizon as if the dipping sun is to blame. Emma rolls her eyes.

Why did Nina laugh? Emma wonders, thinking about Nina sniggering while Aldo said all those horrible things to her, right before he threw the plate. Is that what they think of me?

Emma rests her head on table and looks down at her dusty feet. It’s not that she hates Nina, it’s just that Nina’s a little serious, isn’t she? Emma used to feel superior, knowing that Nina will forever aspire to things that for Emma are God-given. After all, what else can she feel superior to Nina for? Her wit? Emma has never been funny, and whenever she tries it comes off as mean, though she doesn’t intend it to. And Emma knows relying on beauty for comfort is a pillow stuffed with misery, of limp feathers, and the deeper her head sinks, the more it decays the bones in her neck. She knew it more than anything after her ex-boyfriend Dave cheated on her, throwing away seven years and a shared group of friends for the thrill of something new. Can you believe it? The heartless cunt. When Emma saw a picture of the woman, the one Dave fucked in their bedroom, the one who posts pictures of charcuterie boards with hot honey and salami roses, Emma’s first thought was: She’s not even that pretty.

It was then that Emma had come to a realisation that, in this moment, with her head on the table, she returns to: while beauty attracts interest, it doesn’t sustain it, and no matter how beautiful she is, how genetically predisposed she is to perfect hair, a narrow waist or an angelic face, none of it will shield her from pain. Dave, in his own way, said that this was part of the issue: that Emma surrendered herself to the church of optimisation, to hip thrusts at Barre, believing that the soul of a relationship rests in the self and not in the relative. Well, not quite like that. Dave was never good with words.

Emma tries to scratch an itch in the arch of her foot with the opposing big toe.

Feet are disgusting.

Emma feels ashamed. About everything. Sure, her paintings – nude self-portraits – are still selling, and selling for a lot, but is there anything really there? Emma doesn’t know.

Maybe Aldo’s right. Maybe the only reason people – all those rich men – buy her paintings is because they can’t buy her body, so they settle on purchasing its proxy pressed onto canvas. Even though she couches each nude in thematic narratives of hope, pathos, or, as Nina might put it, rotting, she worries these paragraphs are afterthoughts to the panicked desire to preserve her beauty in oil, linseed and turpentine. Emma doesn’t know what will happen when she wilts, when the flower moves past its season.

Emma is a little miserable. But so is everyone else, she tells herself. Nina was born hating herself, and no hobby or man will fix that; Toby has the emotional literacy of a nine-year-old; and Aldo reminds her of her father, which is sad, because at least her dad waited until sixty to become so bitter and hateful. For a while, after Dave, Emma’s misery found a home in Toby. She didn’t feel bad about Nina, at least at first, because if Nina and Toby lacked clear boundaries then it wasn’t Emma’s fault. And if Nina found out, she would just have to grow up and be an adult. But Emma’s heart doesn’t rest so easy. She is not the woman she wants to be – the liberated artist selling nudes of herself without care, taking lovers who have other lovers. She lifts her head off the table.

Where is Toby?

She looks at Aldo, who’s now picking at the skin at the side of his nails. Toby moves out of view and toward Nina, and Emma finds herself walking towards the open glass door.  When she reaches the kitchen she sees Toby hugging Nina with her arms flat at her side. Emma feels exactly like Nina did when she spotted the blood on Toby’s sheets.

‘Leaving me alone,’ Aldo calls from the table. ‘Real fucking nice.’

Emma’s head swings back towards the table.

‘Are you fucking kidding?’ she asks. ‘Did you want a fucking hug?’

Emma looks back at Toby, who has let Nina go, and she thinks of the first time she slept with him, after they’d taken shrooms dissolved in whisky and walked around the Tate Modern like dickheads from a Ben Lerner novel. Later that day, Emma had thought of Nina while Toby fucked her in bed. Isn’t that fucked? Thinking about the other girl he was fucking. Her friend. But Emma wondered how Nina’s body felt in comparison to her own. And she asked him what it was like having sex with Nina, what it was like to have sex with a trans woman. She couldn’t resist, and she asked in a way that implied that she might like to have sex with Nina, too. And who knows, maybe part of Emma did want to fuck Nina, but lying in Toby’s unwashed sheets, all she wanted to know was how she compared to her friend, because Emma needed to feel safer, to know that the essence of her edged Nina out, and that all the other stuff – being, personality, charm – was just white noise that clouded the fundamentals.

‘It’s different but the same,’ Toby had said. ‘It’s sex. You work with what’s there, not with what’s not.’

When he’d said that, Emma had decided to pretend, to tell him what he’d said was beautiful, and she kissed Toby on the lips and realised that she didn’t really love or even like him all that much. She didn’t desire his body but the dialogue of his against hers, utterances that she was somehow worthy, forming wedges between her and Dave, who had slept with the girl who wasn’t that pretty.

She remembers going through Aldo’s wedding photos with Nina. There was a picture of them walking, Nina a few steps ahead. Emma saw Nina’s face fall. Those few steps made Nina look much taller, that much broader than Emma.

‘Don’t be silly,’ Emma had said. ‘You look fine.’

‘Yeah.’

‘I wish I was as tall as you,’ she continued, although she couldn’t look Nina in the eye. ‘I’d feel so powerful.’

Now Emma can’t look at Toby either, although for different reasons. Nina walks past Emma, arms brushing, back towards Aldo outside.

‘The plate’s in the bin,’ Nina says.

Aldo, for the first time since the plate hit the floor, looks at her. He stares. Wordless. Nina rolls her eyes and sits on a sun lounger by the long, cerulean pool, looking out at the view in silence.

Fucking bitch, Aldo thinks.

 

Aldo’s insides are still cooking. They’ve been cooking since he threw the plate. He’s disintegrating into a hateful stew. He scrunches his fist and squeezes one into the other, as if the force could crumble them, but even if it could he knows it’d just be salt in the soup.

Fuck Toby. And fuck Nina and Emma. Those fucking bitches. Fucking stupid bitches.

Aldo might have a problem with women. Has he always had a problem with women? Well, haven’t most – all – men had a problem with women? The divorce has made things worse, and if the only woman on Earth was Vivian, his ex-wife, it might not be a crime to assume that women were terrible. Emma. Maybe he shouldn’t have been so hard on Emma. There should’ve – could’ve – been some solidarity there, after what happened with her and Dave, and with him and Vivian. Maybe calling them bitches is misogynistic. But they really are bitches, aren’t they? Do they really get a free pass because they’re women?

Divorce has been hard on Aldo. Especially divorce at thirty-two. Getting married at twenty-seven was weird, and a woman who is pregnant in her early thirties is basically a teen mum, so of course Vivian was still secretly on the pill even though they were supposed to be trying. He was so angry about the pill. Angrier about that than the cheating. He wanted kids. Badly. It was part of the plan. Work hard, buy a house, have kids, because when you have kids you’re golden. Sex with your partner will have grown stale, anyway, but that love you once had for your wife evolves into something more meaningful, spilling over onto those little versions of you, who will consume so much, require so much of you, so that the fact that you’ve fallen out of love with your partner will matter less and less and less.

Vivian was cunning. Vengeful. On their first date, she told Aldo she discovered her flatmate was using her expensive shampoo – Olaplex, Aldo later learned, as he scoured the labels in her shower – and so she emptied the bottles and filled them with mayonnaise. When he first told Nina about it, Nina, who is Chinese, asked if Vivian was, too.

‘How did you know?’ he’d asked her.

Nina shrugged her shoulders.

‘Obvious.’

Maybe from that point on he should’ve known that Vivian would take whatever she could get her hands on, and in this case it was half the proceeds from the house, even though he (his parents) had provided all the deposit and paid most of the mortgage. Not because she’s Chinese – deep down, he can’t be sure that has anything to do with it – but because she is cunning and vengeful. She has no friends from her childhood.

‘I’m sorry, Aldo,’ Emma had said when he’d told her about the affair and the pill, his focus heavy on the pill. She’d put her head on his shoulder and rubbed her hand along his back. ‘We always thought she was the kind of girl who got a kick out of not being a girl’s girl, which is a really bad sign.’

How nice it was for Emma to have Aldo and for Aldo to have Emma, at least until now. Emma had reminded Aldo that there were right people and wrong people. Right: Aldo and Emma. Wrong: Vivian and Dave. This had made Aldo feel good – very good – so good in fact that he began to parrot Emma’s words.

‘She’s the kind of girl who gets a kick out of not being a girl’s girl,’ he would tell friends, and family, and even colleagues, until it elicited enough odd looks for him to stop.

Toby walks out the house and towards the pool.

Fucking prick, Aldo thinks, glaring at him as he takes the chair next to Nina. Stupid Toby. Fucking Toby.

Why are people so fucking obsessed with Toby? Isn’t that why Aldo threw the plate in the first place? To think they were once a partnership, too, years ago. A comedy duo – sketches, stand-up, you name it. To think they wrote and performed together, until Aldo decided that it was time to get real and shed his sense of humour and become a banker, whereas Toby decided their life was in fact real and that maybe he could really make it work. And Toby did make it work. Sort of. Filmed a BBC pilot with potentially more to come. Aldo would be lying if he said he hoped it’d all work out.

Aldo thinks of the illustration Toby used to show him, the one with two men digging separate tunnels. One of them gives up, though, unbeknownst to him, all that separates him and a clutch of diamonds are a few swings of a pick. The other man keeps swinging on. Was that Aldo and Toby? How utterly unpalatable that would be. How unbearable. It felt to Aldo like he and Toby’s life decisions were two ends of a seesaw, a zero-sum game. But at least Aldo can provide. What the fuck can the others do? Toby works when he can. Emma locks herself in a studio and knows nothing about the real world. Nina seems to make it up as she goes along. They do what they want, and nothing seems to matter. But Aldo cares about duty and responsibility, so much so that he cried when the Queen died, because, in his eyes, she lived a life shaped by those ideals.

‘What the fuck did the Queen do for you, Aldo?’ Vivian once asked, glowering.

He impressed on her then that it was important to give yourself to something bigger, and by that he implied that he was giving himself to her, their life together. That’s why he quit a job he loved for a job he hated, because if you believe in servitude enough then love falls out of the question, and that in some ways is a relief, until it isn’t.

People are ungrateful. Vivian was ungrateful, and so are these motherfuckers. He gives them a holiday and they can’t even cut him some slack. So what if he snapped at Emma for cutting the nose off the brie? Something Emma herself had once told him not to do. What right did Nina have to interject?

‘Aldo,’ her palm had smacked lightly on the table. ‘You’ve been acting like a dick since we got here. We’re supposed to be on holiday.’

‘Oh fuck off, Nina. It’s my fucking house,’ he replied, although his parents would be quick to remind him that it’s not his fucking house. ‘I’m going through a lot.’ And as the three of them looked away from him, at the table, he saw disbelief in their faces. ‘If you knew the first thing about love then maybe you’d understand.’

‘What the fuck is that supposed to mean?’ Nina snapped.

‘Well, Nina,’ Aldo said. ‘You’ve never been in a serious relationship. Your entire existence is fleeting encounters because nobody in their right mind would commit to you, and it all works out for you, because you can write another essay about being trans and the intersection of love, fertility and transness, even though there are probably millions of trans women living perfectly normal lives with loving partners and children, and the problem is, Nina, is that you are probably just a little bit fucked in the head, and you’re so used to profiting from how fucked in the head you are that—’

‘Aldo!’ Toby shouted, matching Nina’s palm on the table with his fist.

‘What the fuck is wrong with you?’ Emma screamed, all while Nina’s shoulders rose and her jaw tightened. Silence fell upon them, and Emma continued. ‘All your fucking digs. Why do you even hang out with us?’

‘Well, I thought you were my friends,’ Aldo said, feeling sorry for himself.

‘I think you just like being around artists,’ Emma muttered. ‘But the more time I spend with you the more I realise you don’t know the first thing about creating art. You aren’t an artist. You haven’t ever been an artist. You’re just a city cunt who likes being around actual art—’

‘Art?!’ Aldo shouted. ‘Art?! Is that what you think you fucking do, Emma? Your ridiculous paintings of your tits that are somehow about neoliberalism?’

And then Nina let out chuckle, which did not go unnoticed by Aldo or Toby, and especially not by Emma, who looked at Nina, face twisted like a Francis Bacon portrait. Now that was talent.

‘Seriously,’ Aldo snarled. ‘How many times do you have to paint your pussy to get why Dave cheated on you?’

‘Aldo!’ Toby interjected,

Nina stayed quiet. Emma crossed her nail into the mosquito bite on her arm.

Is this what they think of me?

Toby’s head fell towards his hands. Everything was going wrong.

‘You’re all fucking useless,’ Aldo continued. ‘What are you going to do when your face and body hit the wall, Emma?’

‘The wall? . . .’ she asked, hands splayed either side of her. ‘The wall?! Are we on fucking 4-chan?!’

‘Yeah, the fucking wall.’ Aldo stood up. ‘In a few years, when someone younger, better and hotter comes along, people are going to forget you, because when it comes down to it, people have painted pussies for years, and yours just aren’t that good.’

Emma stood up. Toby pointed at Aldo.

‘That’s eno—’

‘That’s enough, Aldo,’ jeered Aldo, returning the finger, only drawing Toby further out of his seat. He turned to Nina.

‘Do you know he was fucking you both at the same time?’

She didn’t nod or shake her head, she only pursed her lip, but Aldo wanted more.

‘Did you hear that?’ he said. ‘He was fucking you and her at the—’

‘Shut up!’ Toby shouted.

‘Fuck you!’ Aldo screamed, and then like a reflex, he reached for his plate and threw it at the floor. The ceramic split. Heads turned in unison to stare at the shards on the patio.

In silence, the others joined Nina in sitting down around the table, unsure of where to go once the unretractable had been said. There was no point in putting it back together – any meal from it would just make them question if their art was terrible, if they knew nothing of love, duty or sacrifice, and if they were just angry people who threw plates.

‘There goes dinner,’ Nina said."

    "text": "I thought she would change, but my wife continued to ogle men on the street. Me, I don’t have that kind of confidence. Even if I’m expected to stare at women, in person or on a screen, that’s not the kind of marriage I want. My wife once said I was like a boy she used to know who refused to laugh when the teacher said penis. ‘Do you think that’s normal?’ she asked.

My wife almost always came home after I was asleep. She would take a shower and get into bed. Even on Saturdays she said she had to work. ‘Why are you wearing that?’ I shouted once. ‘It’s a red dress. Why wear that to the office?’

‘Don’t you think I look good?’ she replied. When I didn’t answer she said, ‘You don’t tell someone what to wear!’

I went and stood in front of the apartment door.

She put her hands behind her back and started hopping to prove her breasts wouldn’t fall out. ‘See?’

For days following that, I couldn’t concentrate at work. When the time came to head home, I was reluctant to leave.

I began exercising three times a week for two hours at a time. I thought if I didn’t have money then at least I could look strong. I wasn’t overweight, but I wasn’t in good shape either, and often when I pushed myself on the treadmill the sincerity of my efforts would move me to think that I deserved more respect from my wife.

Coming home, I would drape my sweaty shirt on the sofa so she would see my hard work. I would cook dinner despite my sore muscles, feeling ridiculous gripping the knife or the frying pan with both hands. I would work as fast as I could, afraid that she would suddenly come home and see me fumble.

All of this was exhausting, and each time I cooked I swore I wouldn’t do it again. But the following evening would find me standing in the kitchen, lifting the chopping board from the drying rack, and washing my hands.

One evening, as I stepped out of the shower, I was shocked when both ends of the towel effortlessly overlapped around my waist. I wiped the steam off the mirror and looked at myself. I looked amazing.

I called my wife. ‘Are you nearly home? It’s almost dinner time.’

‘Eating out tonight,’ she said.

‘Do you think it’s healthy? You being out late so often,’ I said, although I didn’t want to imply that I was accusing her of something.

‘I’m fine,’ she said.

‘Are you sure?’

‘Why would I not be?’

Hearing this, I took deep breaths. I pictured myself doing the dishes later but didn’t have the guts to tell her I was unhappy. I started walking around the apartment shirtless. As I passed the window, I thought I was bringing joy to lonely housewives who might see me.

 

 

On the side of a double-decker bus I saw an ad for a fortune teller named Raymond. He had a really large nose. I called him from work – I wanted to know if things would improve.

‘Yup,’ was how he answered the phone. I’d phoned at a perfect time, he said, and chuckled to himself. He was just about to go to bed.

The fact that it was 9 a.m. and he said it so casually made me think he lived a better life than I could imagine.

‘Is something weighing on you?’ he asked.

Tears welled up. I couldn’t speak. Sounding impatient, he told me to come see him at a mall.

The mall was small with little foot traffic. It didn’t take long for me to spot him beside a cardboard booth next to the escalators. He was in a wheelchair, staring at a couple with a baby stroller arguing outside the toilet.

I suddenly regretted coming and tried to leave but he’d already noticed me.

‘You were staring,’ he said. I quickly apologized.

‘A wheelchair is a magnet,’ he said, smacking the wheels. ‘Attracts a lot of attention, which is a form of energy, which can be manipulated to serve you.’

He laughed. I didn’t know what to say.

All of a sudden he hopped up. I saw he was short and pudgy. ‘Are you offended?’

‘No. No.’ I was in shock.

‘Lesson one: anything can happen. So my question: how are you preparing?’

‘I’m not sure,’ I answered. I was smiling from nervousness. I thought he was crazy and I was stupid to come to see him.

‘Don’t worry,’ he said. ‘Luck can make even the weakest man indestructible. If you’re lucky, someone can shoot you in the face, and you’d still live.’

I reached for my cheek.

‘I’m speaking metaphorically.’ I kept smiling.

‘When was the last time you felt lucky?’

I told him about finding a dollar coin on my jogging route and how after that I had looked for coins every time I went jogging. I tried to laugh because it sounded depressing.

He reached for my arm.

Squeezing it, he said, ‘Today you have gotten lucky.’

 

 

I went home that day with a plastic bag of feng shui items – urns, crystals, wind chimes, and a Laughing Buddha figurine. Raymond said the Buddha would bring joy and abundance to my life. To attain them I had to rub its pot belly before starting the day.

I did this the next morning, and then every morning after that. Then I would make breakfast, which tasted better because I was hopeful.

‘Would you like something to eat?’ I asked my wife one morning. ‘It depends,’ she replied, putting away her phone. ‘What are you making? I have a meeting later, I can’t be late for work.’ I brought her two slices of toast.

When she thanked me, smiling, it felt like the Buddha had done its work. I returned to the kitchen, which was pleasantly bright, and started wiping down the counter.

After a while, she came in. ‘Since when are you spiritual?’ She gestured to the Buddha. ‘I’d rather you not waste money on knick-knacks. You’re a grown man.’

I felt my stomach clench. I tried to think.

She came closer. ‘Can I take it to the office instead?’ she said, softly, resting her hand on my chest. ‘My boss is British. He loves this kind of oriental shit.’

I frowned.

‘Please?’

‘Why do you always do this?’ I snapped, and she pulled away. I immediately grew nervous because I knew I had angered her. I looked past her into the living room: the toast was gone.

‘This man pays the salary that pays our bills. Don’t you think it’s wise to make him happy?’

‘Will you come home early then?’ I pointed to the television. ‘When was the last time we watched a movie?’

She shaped her fingers into a gun and mimed blowing her brains out.

‘This is such a small thing,’ she said. ‘Why do you have to make it difficult? Why must there be a reaction every fucking time?’ I didn’t respond. She waited. ‘I’m only asking you for some help.’

‘Look,’ I said. ‘I’m sorry.’

‘Why are you apologizing? What for? Apologizing isn’t the same as agreeing to do better.’ I saw her glance at the clock on the wall, and then she kissed my cheek briefly.

I was glad when she left that morning.

 

 

That same day, I returned to the mall. Raymond was standing in front of the booth, hands on hips. He was heavily stubbled. When he saw me, he stuck out his thumb. ‘Perfect timing, again.’

‘Thanks,’ I said, and then nervously added, ‘can I buy another Buddha? Is that allowed?’ I felt my ears getting hot.

At first, he said nothing and stared at me like he was confused.

Then he tore the duct tape that held the booth together and began dismantling it.

‘This isn’t my real office. I’m only here to help out a friend.’

‘Your friend is very lucky,’ I said.

There was a long pause. Not knowing what else to say, I quickly bent over and stacked the cardboard into a pile. I could feel his eyes on me. When I finally looked up, he was nodding to himself.

‘The guy who owns this mall is my friend,’ he said and picked up the cardboard. ‘He’s a billionaire. I’m just a decorative piece. You get to use people like that when you’re that rich.’

It came as a surprise. The fact that he had made himself vulnerable, I suddenly felt I could tell him anything. I looked around. The mall was getting crowded. Lines were starting to form outside the cafés and restaurants. ‘I know what you mean,’ I said, placing a hand over my heart for emphasis.

He came closer and put his arm around me.

‘Affinity,’ he said. ‘We have that.’ He gave me a new Buddha, free of charge, and then invited me to come to his home the following Monday.

 

 

Monday, I arrived in a loose t-shirt and jeans, thinking I would spend hours kneeling in front of tall statues inside a dark apartment, choking on incense smoke, but it wasn’t like that at all.

His place was a three-story semi-detached. There was a tree on the roof. Entering the metallic gate, I could hear chatter from inside the house.

There were several people waiting by the front door. Raymond’s housekeeper welcomed us. We were shown how to deposit our shoes in the electronic locker. I was carrying a pineapple as a gift for good luck, but my heart fell when I saw others had thought to do the same.

Inside the main hall, the ceiling was high, the walls lined with mirrors. The floor was a cool beige marble. Guests mingled, talked, and sipped drinks. I thought Raymond must be very respected, the fact that so many people turned up for his party on a Monday night. It was like a wedding I had once attended where nearly a thousand guests had shown up; everyone was confident the marriage would be a happy one.

At the back of the room there was a projector screen; Raymond stood there, facing a small crowd. He was dressed in a very clean navy suit, a white scarf tied around his neck. When he spotted me, he raised his chin to say hey. This made people turn their heads at me.

Quickly, I said to the man beside me, ‘He mistook me for someone. It’s my first time here.’

The man glanced at my pineapple and gave a warm smile. ‘First, a speech. Then we get to eat.’

The lights dimmed, and Raymond whispered testing into the microphone. He began speaking of ‘fate as a current’ and the screen behind him flashed a picture of the sea. He then drew connections between the why and the how, and why we should not resist it. Every now and then, he looked down, as if he’d just shared something very intimate with us. ‘Do you know what happens when you drown?’ he said. ‘You sink and fish eat you.’ I found his voice alluring.

After his speech, Raymond came and relieved me of my pineapple, handing it to his housekeeper. He was buzzing. When he hugged me, sweat from his hair touched my cheek.

‘Did you bring it?’ he whispered.

‘Yes,’ I said. ‘Hold on.’

I surrendered my birth certificate, which he took with both hands and locked inside a safe deposit box. He was honest with me. He said this was about our birth timings: some numbers are good, others are bad. Putting them all in one place neutralizes the aura – like a blender – so that everyone here can be on equal footing.

‘It takes a while to intuit what you can and cannot control.’

At the time, I didn’t really understand what he was getting at. I was just happy to have someone to talk to inside a crowded room.

‘Look around, you are now part of a large family,’ he said, gesturing. He wanted me to circle the room, weave between his guests to get a feel for the crowd, the excitement. But I was to keep my hands in my pockets, my lips sealed. I was not to return anyone’s greeting and to watch what that felt like.

 

 

People continued to arrive. Eventually there must have been eighty or ninety people in the room. Voices were coming from all directions. I was greeted with smiles, nods, and after a while I began to relax. I checked the time; this time last night – I remembered very clearly – I had been snacking alone in front of the television, unhappy that my wife wasn’t home.

Who knew where she was right now?

The buffet line was ready. Five folding tables, lined up, with ornamental flowers and trays of food. Two stewards in white uniforms were handing out paper plates and plastic forks and spoons.

Someone said to me, ‘The chicken curry is the freshest.’ I smiled, as if I agreed, and joined the queue.

I sent my wife a text: On your way home?

As I was putting away my phone, I suddenly recognized someone: an Olympian. I was startled. I had once seen her swim on television. Now, she was wearing a tight dress and talking with guests. The fact that she looked twice as good with dry hair surprised me. When she laughed, I could see her teeth were very healthy. Our eyes met and we both smiled; it felt like I’d won something. My heart was racing. I started scanning the room for more famous faces.

When the party was over, and taxis were pulling into the driveway, I was surprised to see many people still holding onto their pineapples. Most of them hovered by the hallway, and a few looked over at me as if I should tell them what to do. I approached one of them, a woman with dark circles under her eyes. The sense of serendipity had made me bold. I wanted to say something kind, but I became embarrassed at the last moment and said, ‘Waiting for a taxi?’

She shrugged and then left the house.

As I had hoped, Raymond came to me as I was putting on my shoes. ‘Fantastic work,’ he said. ‘I want you back next week.’

‘Oh, next week?’

‘I thought you’d be happier,’ he said.

‘One week is a long time to wait,’ I said.

That made him laugh. ‘You’re a really nice guy. You deserve good things.’ Then he extended his hand to haul me onto my feet.

From his eyes, I could tell he wasn’t joking at all.

 

 

Over the next few weeks, I found myself arriving early to have drinks with Raymond so he could introduce me to his celebrity guests before the party started. All was well. The famous, I realized, excelled at small talk and often they spoke with an energetic friendliness that was unique to high achievers. Being close to them, I felt as though I was back in school and these classmates had no qualms about teaching me a thing or two because they did not view me as competition. Eventually I got to be on first name basis with some of them. This was different. My younger self would have been proud.

The parties always had a good mix of men and women, although more often than not there were more good-looking women than men. Some of these men wore ladies’ suit pants that sat high up their waists, and would go about the room and strike up conversations with random women. These men appeared at ease and said things that made the women laugh. Watching them, I felt jealous.

One night, a man from this group came up to me and offered me a drink. He was a smallish guy with a friendly smile.

‘Hi,’ he said. ‘Raymond said you might have a question for me.’ I was taken aback.

‘What do you want to know?’ I looked at his pants. ‘Oh, it doesn’t look great,’ he admitted, ‘but it’s not awful either. You do get stares once in a while, and it can be very exciting. It empowers me.’

I thought about this for a while, finishing my drink.

That night, I took a taxi home. I found my wife already in bed, hiding under the duvet. ‘What’s going on?’ I asked her. ‘Don’t you have meetings and whatnot?’

‘Are there clinics in the neighborhood still open?’

‘I’ll check,’ I said and backed out of the room. I turned on the lights in the living room but after a while turned them off and walked up to the laundry basket in the kitchen. The apartment was very warm. I felt dazed, and a part of me was hoping my wife would suddenly emerge from the bedroom. When she did not, I lifted her pajama pants and began stretching the waistband. I thought I had gone mad. I put on the pants. The fabric was so soft. Once it brushed against my thighs I realized my hips were easing, my shoulders loosened. I tried walking and started laughing. I found myself opening the front door.

I ended up at the park. Breathing in the fresh air, I felt unusually light-hearted. I looked at my surroundings, the park bench, the street lamps, the stray cat, and the soft moon hanging in the sky.

I entered a 7-Eleven and bought a beer.

I said to the cashier, ‘How are you tonight? Everything going well?’ And she smiled back. ‘A little tired but thank you for asking.’

On my way home, I took deep gulps of the beer. I couldn’t stop thinking about that smile.

 

 

When I asked Raymond why he organized these parties, he joked that he was an attention-seeker. But then he turned serious and said, ‘If you spot a problem, you must let me know. I’ve been doing this for so long I can’t tell what’s lacking anymore.’ One night, he told me that he suspects his caterer had been overcharging him. We were in the hall, looking through the window, waiting for the first guests to arrive. ‘I’ll find you a better one,’ I offered, wanting to please.

The following week, I started a book to record how much each guest ate and drank, and I alerted him to a television host who always came for a quick drink and then left.

‘Should we do something?’ I asked.

‘If it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be,’ he answered almost immediately. When I didn’t say anything, he pointed to an actor walking around with ankle-wrist weights. ‘That was my idea – keep fit while socializing. This guy used to talk shit about me. But then my billionaire friend cast him in a film, and now he sticks to me like a fly. It’s a mistake to force people to like you.’

My face was stiff. ‘Does that mean I have no control?’

‘No, not always,’ he said, smiling. ‘You can try mimicking people. Most people find it hard to say no to themselves.’

So I began picking up the mannerisms of people at the parties after that. I approached the rich and famous in the room and offered them drinks. I asked about their day, whether the food was to their liking, acting as if I were their host. Then I observed how they responded and took mental notes.

Now I saw the crowded room as brimming with opportunities.

To appear confident in conversation, I learned to pinch my thumb and forefinger and move them like a woodpecker. A simple phrase, ‘I mean it,’ was suddenly charged with profundity.

And with time, I also grew less hesitant to speak my mind. I came clean the minute I got confused. I said, ‘Excuse me, but could you elaborate?’ When someone did well, I said, ‘That’s incredible,’ or ‘I’m happy for you.’ I said these things with verve. Another thing I learned was saying no. Now, whenever I looked into people’s eyes, I found myself saying, ‘I have explained myself and feel no need to do so any further,’ or ‘Let us just agree to disagree.’ Hearing these words, I would become deeply moved by myself.

The first time I uttered, ‘Let’s agree to disagree’ in an argument with my wife, she was shocked and became quiet.

She thought for a bit, and then lifted my hand. ‘Have you noticed? Your hands are smaller than most men’s.’

‘Sure.’ I felt nothing like my old self.

Then she pressed my hand against her breast. ‘See what I mean?’

I was silent. I felt calm and a bit absent. I shrugged. ‘I’m taking a shower,’ I told her and walked away. To my surprise, she followed me into the bathroom and started peeling off her clothes.

After that day, she began to initiate sex frequently, three to four times a week. And for a while, I felt pretty good about myself. When we kissed, she would leave hickies on my neck and laugh when she turned my head side to side to study them. Sometimes she would ask what I wanted and performed those things for me, and I would ask her the same, but she would shake her head and say, ‘No. No need,’ her voice coming from a faraway place. The hardest part was pretending that I didn’t mind and going to bed afterwards, even though I was irritated. Because the marriage continued to lack tenderness, I realized I couldn’t enjoy the additional sex my wife was giving. I found myself drinking more and more heavily at Raymond’s parties and, once home, using my drunkenness to avoid any sort of intimacy.

 

 

The night I met the billionaire, I wasn’t supposed to know he was dropping by, but Raymond had hired a team to trim the hedges in the front yard and even had the caterer replace a steward who had pimples on his face, so I knew pretty much instantly.

Raymond’s housekeeper and I were looking for stains on the living room carpet. Raymond inspected the food trays, his face pinkish with make-up.

‘Come and taste this,’ he called to me.

I hurried over. He smelled of cologne. ‘You look good,’ I said. Silver glitter flickered in his gelled hair. I thought how nice it must feel to know that someone was going out of their way to impress you.

‘Thanks,’ he said. ‘Is the curry spicy enough?’

‘Very.’

‘Good. He likes spicy. How are things with your wife?’

I looked at him. ‘Not great,’ I said, ‘I’m nervous all the time.’

‘Just keep doing what you’re doing. If things change, then it’s meant to be.’

‘I try to be nice but always I end up getting hurt.’

He turned to look at the driveway. Seeing it was empty, he said, ‘The issue is not your approach. Rather, some people simply do not find value in what we are offering them. It doesn’t always mean they’re happier, and so we must sympathize.’

I thought about this. ‘The thing is,’ I said, angrily, ‘I’m not asking for heaven and earth. What I’m just asking for is perfectly reasonable. Prioritize me over late-night meetings every now and then. Say, “Thank you for making breakfast.” Don’t say things like, “You’re the sort of guy who tries to dip a tea bag in a mug and misses completely.” Are these things too much to ask for?’

‘Calm down,’ he said, leaning forward. ‘I know what it is you want to hear. You want me to tell you that you’re right. But I can’t say that. What I can say is that you’re not wrong. For everything that happens, there are at least a dozen ways to understand it. Perhaps what you need is to step out of yourself. It takes time, but you will get there. I promise, all right? Now help me move the sunflowers to the center of the table. They look better there.’

The billionaire arrived with his wife and two bodyguards. He was tall, middle-aged, and wore brown shorts and a white t-shirt. His wife wasn’t as young and attractive as I thought she would be. She had a bouquet of lilies under her arm, and the crumpled flowers made her look strangely weary.

When Raymond saw them, he shouted, ‘My friend!’ and then hurried over to embrace the billionaire. It was around seven in the evening; the sun had just set.

Everyone turned to look at them.

Then the two disengaged and stepped back from each other. The billionaire patted Raymond on the cheek. ‘Say something interesting!’

It silenced the room.

I looked to the housekeeper from across the room. When she caught my eye, she turned and disappeared into the kitchen. Raymond was frozen but smiling.

The billionaire repeated himself.

Watching this, I felt sorry for Raymond and suddenly protective of him. I could release the drink in my hand – the crash, the liquid splattering on the floor would draw away everyone’s attention. All I had to do was uncurl my fingers, but somehow I couldn’t do it.

Then I saw Raymond turn to face the room and spread out his arms. ‘How do you control fate?’ he began, raising his voice. ‘I say go for a run before getting a haircut. If your hairdresser can’t stand the sweat and smell, she’ll give you a free wash.’ As he spoke, I became more and more upset with myself.

The billionaire was scanning the room. Nobody uttered another word until he burst out laughing.

Both men were soon surrounded by guests who went up to introduce themselves. I volunteered to take photos. I tried to be useful. Then Raymond pulled me aside and said he would be in his study and asked me to welcome the newcomers. ‘See that everyone has the food and drinks they need.’ I gave a thumbs up, and then he and the billionaire went upstairs.

I shook hands with people and took their pineapples. A few had brought pomelos and argued that pomelos were auspicious too. ‘Sure,’ I said, and turned them toward the door. The room was extremely noisy now and, from time to time, I thought about my wife. I wondered where she was, what she was doing and how she was feeling.

I spotted the billionaire’s wife alone by the buffet table. I approached her, obliquely, so as not to startle her. But before I could say anything, she snatched a handful of grapes and began mashing them into her face. She started crying.

‘Hey,’ I said.

She turned to me. ‘Oh shit, sorry.’

I quickly reached out with napkins. Because I knew my flowers, I said, ‘Lilies. Someone apologized to you?’

She looked down at the flowers. She tried to say something but found her throat blocked.

‘Breathe,’ I said.

‘Is sex so important to men?’ she asked me. ‘What about love? What about love?’ She was sniffling.

I showed her my wedding ring. I said, ‘Of course, love is important.’

She smiled and nodded, and I felt grateful for some reason. ‘Why else would two people be together?’

I wanted to talk about my wife and my feelings toward her then, but I had learnt that you should never talk about yourself when someone confides in you. So I ushered her to the sofa and sat her down beside me. ‘What’s causing your unhappiness?’ I asked.

She wavered for a long time before pulling out her phone. ‘Look at this,’ she said and played this grainy clip of a woman sucking off a man inside a hotel room. ‘This is the man I married.’

‘Ah.’ I thought for a second. ‘Have you spoken to him?’

She nodded. ‘It was ugly,’ she said. ‘He smashed wine bottles against the wall. And then threatened to cut his wrists.’ She paused and hid her face.

‘You must be heartbroken.’

I gestured for Raymond’s housekeeper to bring us drinks. While we waited, I wondered what Raymond would say at a time like this. When the drinks came, I took a gulp and tipped my glass at her, feeling the early stages of drunkenness.

‘What if you had to choose between two pairs of pants?’ I asked. ‘The first has been soaked in wet dog shit, and the other once belonged to a murderer who tortured children – which pair would you pick?’

She looked at me.

‘Both are the same size, color, and cutting,’ I added. ‘But one has been soaked in shit.’ She laughed nervously.

‘Let me remind you. Both have been washed. One is just as clean as the other.’ Then I reached for her hands. ‘Do you see? Your choice is based on an aura – this feeling that something is dirtier than the other. Do you see what I mean? To forgive your husband, think of him like a laundered pair of pants.’

I took a deep breath and looked around the room and it was suddenly obvious how loud I had been. I felt lightheaded.

‘You love him, am I right?’ I asked. ‘You want to forgive him?’ She couldn’t tell exactly.

‘I think so,’ she said. ‘It’s not like one day I love him and the next I don’t – I can tell myself that.’

‘Fair enough.’

She stared at my face for a moment, narrowing her eyes, and then snorted. ‘How much do you think murderers’ pants cost?’

‘I’m sure you can afford it.’

When she laughed, I felt triumphant. I said to her, ‘Thank you for sharing.’

And then I heard clapping behind me.

It was Raymond. He looked very pleased. ‘You have potential,’ he said. ‘You have wisdom to share.’ I told him I was just trying to help and he thanked me. I looked around the room. The billionaire was eating by one of the cocktail tables and talking with two beautiful women. He had a napkin tucked in his collar and held a fork in his hand.

Later, when we were alone, Raymond whispered in my ear, ‘Go upstairs. Go into my study. Someone will greet you there.’ I had never seen the inside of his study.

I went up and opened the door. There was a strong smell of cigar smoke and perfume. A woman in a tube dress was stubbing out a cigarette on an ashtray. ‘Another one?’ She glanced over at me, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up.

I took a deep breath. ‘Yes.’

That night, I left the house without shame or guilt. I kept thinking of the things my wife did that irritated me. Cheating on her was to avoid getting hurt. I felt optimistic, stronger. Walking toward the bus stop, I wished I could walk forever. Then I hopped onto a bench and started playing the air guitar. I imagined undergarments, roses, and love letters hurled at me. I imagined carrying these items home in large plastic bags and showing them to my wife; she becomes jealous, then afraid. All was not lost. I felt certain I could be kind to her now. I looked up at the sky. It was black and starry.

 

 

Little by little, everything was arranged. Raymond converted one of his studies into an office where I could offer consultations to his guests. He bought me suits and shoes, and even paid for a dentist to whiten my teeth.

I asked him, ‘Why would people want to hear what I have to say?’

‘You don’t make them,’ he answered. ‘You speak, and if they like what they hear, they’ll stay around. If they don’t, they don’t. That has always been the job.’

My official title wasn’t fortune teller but Life Coach. I took my station five nights a week and shook hands with people who came in, asking them, ‘Do you want to feel like everything is within your reach?’

Usually, they stayed silent and waited for me to go on. Once alcohol was served, I had them sit down. I would then ask various questions and nod solemnly at their stories. The shy ones tended to look at their hands or the ceiling while they spoke, but everyone wanted a listening ear and someone to say aloud what they already knew in their hearts. Deep down, we all recognize that things will never change, and we are more or less ready to accept it.

As Life Coach, what I offered was encouragement.

I posed questions like, ‘What’s the worst that could happen?’ And if they answered, I said, ‘That’s unlikely. You know that.’

Most of these sessions lasted between five to ten minutes, though they got longer as I gained more confidence. Once the time was up, I would fish out a crystal bracelet from the desk drawer and say, ‘This will protect you from harm. Wear it, even in the shower, and you’ll notice good things coming your way.’ These bracelets weren’t free, of course. They cost as much as a Rolex watch. Raymond’s housekeeper would collect the money at the door.

I really enjoyed what I did. Whenever I arrived at the house and saw the party, people turning their heads, I imagined half of them had come specifically to see me. Nearly always I would find gifts on my desk: tickets to sold-out concerts, vouchers for skin-care products endorsed by my actor friends, and sometimes, Mao Shan Wang durians from a humble fruit-seller buddy. Moments like these, I felt loved.

I was enjoying myself so much that I could ignore, to some extent, the tension I felt at home. I began making up stories about where I had been but at the same time I felt indignant that I had to lie. I thought if I had a good time at a party or helped someone, I should be able to come home smiling and tell someone. Often I would return very late, two or three in the morning. I would be hot and tipsy and would walk unsteadily. I would wash my face with cold water to sober up. Once, my wife got mad because I’d woken her up. ‘Are you an elephant?’ she shouted and threw a pillow at me. ‘Why do you have to walk so loud?’ She was having a lovely dream and now it was gone. I was staring at my spot on the bed, paralyzed.

I left the room and slept on the sofa.

I couldn’t find my Laughing Buddha the following day. I called my wife, and she came out of the room and shoved a five-dollar in my hand. She had just showered and was all dressed up, but her hair was wet. She said the Buddha cluttered the flat and so she sold it at Cash Converters.

I demanded an apology.

‘Go pray for one,’ she said, and then left the apartment.

From then on, it became a competition of who would come home later than the other. My wife would slam the door or the toilet seat, jolting me awake, whereas I would max out the volume on the television or gargle Listerine. Some nights, though, she would open the door and just stand there, watching me. And I would see her lips move but not hear anything.

Weeks went by. There was so much anger inside me I felt tired all the time. Unable to rid this feeling, I was left confused. I didn’t understand why I was still miserable despite having transformed myself. And I became so frustrated that I thought I was going to cry. Not knowing what else to do, I bought flowers and wrote apology cards, but I was aware that I was doing these things to stop the fighting and it was out of self-preservation.

 

 

One night, I got very drunk. When I came home, I heard muffled voices from behind the bedroom door. At first I thought it was my imagination. So I lowered myself onto the sofa and tried to focus, and I began to feel sick in the heart. My head started to spin. I vomited. And when I took a breath, I couldn’t fill my chest with enough air. Exhausted, I blacked out.

When I woke up the next day, the bedroom door was closed. I thought I was still dreaming. Then, realizing that whoever was with my wife last night must have snuck out and seen me fast asleep, I became wide awake. I didn’t know what to do. I thought about how my wife and I used to go window-shopping before we got married. One time we saw a man leaving the casino, grinning, and my wife, on a whim, suggested we follow him around the mall. We were embarrassed for him when he stood in line for boba tea. My wife called him a loser and we laughed, then returned to the casino and tailed one guy after another until someone bought a Louis Vuitton bag. Lying there, I felt so empty and in such a desperate need of comfort that I nearly got up to check inside the bedroom. But I was afraid of another fight. I wondered if this was any way for a person to live.

It took effort, but I eventually sat up and wiped the tears from my face. I took out my phone and opened YouTube. I watched award speeches and started smiling when actors included anecdotes of trials and tribulations. Every now and then the camera panned over to an actor’s spouse, and I would spot their happy tears. It was the most beautiful thing. I felt happy for them. I don’t know how long I stayed there before my wife came out of the bedroom.

 

 

She told me it wasn’t working. Her voice was soft but firm. She patted the sofa cushion, indicating she wanted me to come closer. She waited for me move, but when I did not she said, ‘Why are you like this?’ I felt a lot of guilt, yet also anger – she had chosen not to bear any responsibility for what had become of us.

It was almost noon, and sunlight poured in through the window.

The room didn’t look real. ‘Did you sleep with another man?’ I asked.

When she couldn’t give an answer, I found myself yelling at her. I called her a bully, a tyrant, but none of this seemed to unnerve her or move her to say something nice to me.

‘Do you think you’ll change?’ I finally asked.

‘Look, this marriage is over,’ she said. ‘I love you, but it’s over.’

She had on a full face of makeup and was wearing that low-cut dress I hated. ‘Why are you wearing that again?’ I asked.

‘You know what? I’ll give you a few days to process this.’ Then she packed some clothes into a suitcase. At the door, she said, ‘Text me.’

I nodded slowly.

My shame was now so great that I felt like hurting myself. I got up and guzzled water from the kitchen tap. My mouth was all twisted. As I drank, I regretted everything mean I could have said to her but did not.

Later that day, I removed our mattress from our bedroom because it felt dirty. I slid a blanket underneath the mattress and began to yank the fabric until my body was cold. At the front door, I put on my slippers. I took the stairs.

I began dragging the mattress across the street.

It took almost an hour. Several times I had to squat down to catch my breath. All around me was quiet except for crows cawing in the trees, and I propped the bed against the side of the dumpster so it wouldn’t obstruct foot traffic. Looking at the mattress, I considered how tainted it was. I wiped away my sweat, and the reality of having been abandoned suddenly became real. I’ve done nothing wrong, I said to myself and began to heave. After that, I came home, took a shower, and ate something.

For a week or so, at 7.30 p.m. every evening, I called Raymond on the phone. This helped me pass the time. I would stand by the window and listen to him talk about the parties. He said there were people asking for me. I assured him I would be back because I felt the need to be polite.

He mentioned a gift from the billionaire: a silver Bentley. It was sitting in the driveway. He had been having his meals by the window so that he could look at the car.

‘I can’t drive,’ he said and laughed.

I told him I was looking out the window too. That some idiot had left a mattress by the dumpster. The garbage truck hadn’t arrived, and it had been almost a week. Rain or shine, the bed sat there, slumped, for all the neighbors to see. Several cars drove by. Schoolchildren in blue uniforms were hurrying back from school. I was wearing shorts and a gray singlet.

‘It’s an eyesore,’ I said.

He was supposed to speak but did not.

    "url": "https://granta.com/depth-of-a-cave",
    "text": "Bruno had always known the caves were there, he wrote to Pascal and the Moulinards, but the depth of them, their spatial complexity, had stunned him.

We never expect the true depth of a cave, he said, on account of our indoctrination, our enslavement to the aboveground, which is scaled to us and above us, scaled to trees, to high-rise buildings, to the industrial dreams of twentieth-century man, and to his military imagination, scaled to fighter jets, and to heaven, to our need to claim something in the blue beyond, a thing we might call ‘blessed’.

This vertical arrow aiming from ground to sky constitutes modern man’s entire spatial reality, Bruno wrote. It excludes the other direction, he wrote, the down-into-the-earth. This is an incredible blind spot, he said, and he himself had not understood how blind, until he one day squeezed himself into his own cave, on his own little property in the Guyenne.

When he had purchased the land, in the early 1970s, the previous owner had shown him the cave as a curiosity. That owner had kept a board over its entrance. Beyond the board was an opening, a cavern five feet shallow, at the end of which two rocks angled together into a narrow crevice. For years, the board remained there. One day, in the period after he’d left the farmhouse, and the barn, and was sleeping in his little stone hut, Bruno removed the board and went in. He put his hand through the crevice in the rocks and felt wind. He understood that beyond the crevice there must be a large open space. He returned with ropes and a headlamp and pushed through the crevice and lowered himself. He did not hit bottom for quite a while. When he did, he was in an enormous room, its ceiling perhaps three meters high. He found multiple openings off this main room leading in different directions.

One particularly magnificent discovery was a chamber that was flocked white like a snowy landscape. Is this a dream? he wondered. It was not a dream. The walls were coated with magnesium crystals. They were blanketed in sparkling white, a natural geologic phenomenon. Some call this moon milk, Bruno wrote. It coated the floor. In that moon-milk floor were indentations that he believed were records of human presence, and in particular, shapes that looked, and felt, like the footprints of a child. There were regions of the underground network where water ran through, he said. The water was very cold. In some places it was neck-high, he said, and in the water lived strange crustaceans with translucent shells that seemed to thrive in absolute darkness.

This entire valley, he said, was laced with underground springs and rivers and lakes. Because Bruno’s adult son studied hydrology and currently worked in that field, he had helped Bruno to better understand the caverns and the water table and especially how to remain safe, because in winter, he said, caves could fill and quickly.

One day my son took me to a lavoir fed by a spring, Bruno said. The water is clear, my son pointed out. When the water is cloudy, he said, you know that someone has been in the cave whose spring fills this washbasin. The underground waterway, my son explained, has thick silt in its bed. When it is disturbed by footsteps, silt is kicked up.

 

The cave in which Bruno slept was dry year-round, if a good deal cooler in temperature than a modern Frenchman might prefer.

He planned to stay in the home he had made for himself underground. Although he did exit the caves regularly, as he indicated in the emails. He got fresh air. He tended to his permaculture, having renounced modern farming techniques. He took walks on shaded forest paths. And he wrote to Pascal Balmy and the Moulinards at a computer terminal that belonged to his adult daughter, in the kitchen of the old stone farmhouse. Bruno’s son had pointed out to him that the French government had more than clouded the waters of the communal washbasins. They had desecrated the entire subterranean world of southern France with tunnels for their high-speed trains.

I can hear the Paris–Toulouse from down there, Bruno said. I sense its vibrations. I feel the faintest touch of its wind.

Bruno’s son was of the opinion that the state’s mad plan to leach out all the groundwater and shunt it into industrial bays would wreck the ecological balance of the Guyenne.

When the digging work began for the Tayssac megabasin, Bruno said he was convinced he heard the sound of the excavators. He felt a level of disturbance that seemed to come from multiple directions, and from which there might be no escape. One day, the sound stopped, he said. The subterranean world was quiet, left in peace. But peace was temporary. These days, he said, I hear again the distant groan of machines clawing downward.

And just when I thought we were at last arriving at the main subject – sabotage of trains and of earth-moving equipment – Bruno went off the rails.

 

He’d been in these caves twelve years now, he said, and still he had not gotten to any definable ‘end’, the caverns’ design instead calling into question the whole concept of an end.

I hear people, he said, whose voices are eternal in this underground world, which is all planes of time on a single plane.

Here on earth is another earth, he said. A different reality, no less real. It has different rules.

You won’t understand any of this from me telling you about it, Bruno said. You might even dismiss what I say. The little I myself understand has taken patience, he said, and rigorous deprogramming.

For nine-tenths of human time on earth people went underground. Their symbolic world was formed in part by their activities in caves, by modalities and visions that darkness promised. Then, this all ceased. The underground world was lost to us. The industrial uses of the earth, the digging, fracking, tunneling, are mere plunder and do not count, Bruno said. Modern people who build bomb shelters, planning to survive some version of apocalypse, also do not count, he said. Yes, they go underground, but not in mind of a human continuum, a community. They think, I’ll be the clever one, the one who survives mass death. But why would you want to survive mass death? What would be the purpose of life, if life were reduced to a handful of armed pessimists hoarding canned foods and fearing each other? In a bunker, you cannot hear the human community in the earth, the deep cistern of voices, the lake of our creation.

In my cave, he said, under my cave, welling up from deeper passages, I hear so many things. Not just the drip of water.

I hear voices. People talking. Sometimes it’s in French, sometimes Occitan, or older tongues of the Languedoc, many languages I do not recognize, sounds of which I cannot understand a word, but I know that what I hear is humans, it is human talk.

Did we always have language? We don’t know the answer to this.

Linguists try to chart what they call ‘glotto-chronologies’. They picture language like a tree, with a trunk. The first language, at the base of the trunk, being simple and common, what some call ‘nostratic’. This is a fantasy. But who can refute them? They cannot escape the chains of their telos, the sad idea that they are the logical outcome, the advanced form of human speech, and that what came before must have been simple and crude.

They never imagine that if language is a tree, they must look not at its trunk, but at its roots, which, like a tree’s roots, might form an upside-down chandelier of extravagant complexity, reaching and spreading deep into the dark beyond. But most people are unable to grasp how far down the physical world goes. And they would not know that voices are stored in its depths, unless they were to hear those voices.

It is hard to explain, he said. You would have to have lived as I live, done what I have done, learned what I have learned, in order to hear what I hear. You would need a different consciousness, he said.

When you live underground, among the things you discover is that you are not alone. You’re in a world richly peopled. Occupied by legions.

Homo erectus, who stood up and cooked, Bruno said, he is here.

Homo neanderthalensis, who huddled modestly and dreamed expansively: here.

Homo sapiens, gone into caves to paint, to render his capture with extra legs, extra horns, so that these beasts canted and ran over cave walls, or butted heads, clashed and fought, all in the light of a torch, H. sapiens’s underground cinema house: that resourceful and ruinous forebear of ours, he is here.

Cathars and other heretics, the few not slaughtered, gone deep, living in darkness: yes, present.

Cagots, after the war of 1594, hiding to survive. Surviving in secret.

Here.

Cavers, nineteenth-century men and boys, killed by curiosity, fallen in, unable to make their way out: here.

The partisans, men of my own boyhood, who retreated underground to hide from rampaging Germans: they, too, are here.

For a long time, he said, you cannot tune in. Then, you might sense a current or buzz of telluric energy. This sound transforms, the more time you spend in caves. It becomes voices. You hear these voices but are unable to isolate them. It takes years to learn how to listen, to differentiate, to adjust your inner tuner to a position on the atemporal bandwidth of the underground world.

Remember shortwave transmission? he asked them. Probably you don’t, he answered. Tuning into shortwave programming used to be an art, Bruno said. Depending on the bandwidth, it worked best at night, on account of how radio waves travel back from the ionosphere. There was a book, he said, that listed programs by calendar schedule and megahertz. Some of the programs came in stronger than others. You learned to listen for where to put the shortwave dial, between two points of static, and how to position your antenna, in order to hear a Bulgarian choir or news from Senegal or Venezuela’s Radio Juventud.

Shortwave is real, of course, he said. It is also a metaphor. I bring it up not to reminisce over dead technologies, but to help you understand. Cave frequencies, he said, are not three to thirty megahertz. Cave bandwidth crosses moments, eras, epochs, eons. You have to learn to get inside the monophony, to tease it apart. Eventually, you encounter an extraordinary polyphony. You begin to sort, to filter. You hear whispers, laughter, murmurs, pleas. There’s a feeling that everyone is here. A wonderful feeling, I should add. Because suddenly you realize how alone we have been, how isolated, to be trapped, stuck in calendar time, and cut off from everyone who came before us.

I never want to be that alone again, he said."

Down below, deep in the belly of the ship, we could hear its every moan: wood straining under the weight of bodies, rusted chains grinding against the walls. Even our captors’ feet shuffling back and forth, back and forth, above us. We knew death had come.

We couldn’t help but search the surrounding darkness for it, as if death might leap from the damp planks. Where we were taken from, death had many faces; it was a panther stalking in the shadows, a fever that rose with the rains. But down here all we saw were the dim outlines of our bodies, packed tight, shoulder to shoulder, back-to-back.

The bite of chains kept us awake, our wrists and ankles rubbed raw from weeks of the same. When exhaustion gave way to sleep, it was fitful, haunted by wicked dreams of home – dreams that twisted the familiar into something cruel. We tried to stay still to save each other from the pain, but then infection set in. With skin cracked and swollen, there was little to do but scratch and scrape, scratch and scrape, and when that brought no relief, we tore at whatever flesh we could to dull the burn, to feel anything but the rot creeping through our bones.

Drops of saltwater dripped from above and stung our wounds, stiffened our hair, matted it to our scalps.

We tried not to lose ourselves in misery. Our moaning had subsided long ago. In the early days, a woman screamed with terror and her cries summoned one of the white men down with his weapon. He took her up the stairs that led to the sky and we never saw her again. We heard her though, her wails echoing in the night. The memory of her screams silenced us all, like the cry of a hyena warning of death lurking near.

Many of us stopped praying. But there were some who held hope – hope that the big white water, in its mercy, might swallow the ship whole before it delivered us to whatever world waited.

Nothing could save us from the stink of pus and piss, spilling across the floor, the air thick with it and clinging to our skin, our breath, until it became part of us – until we could no longer tell where the stench ended and we began. In this way, we became one – a part of each other, through misery, shit and blood.

To pass the time, and perhaps more to forget it altogether, we clung to whatever fragments of our lives we could bear remembering. Down here, a thought was a precious thing. It carried our entire lives. One man pictured a wife asleep in their hut, an infant nestled at her chest – their faces soft and serene. Perhaps they shared the same dream, a dream he tried to reach right into. When his hand brushed against nothing, in that moment, he lost everything he had once possessed all over again.

The image stripped him bare and left him weeping into the dark, speaking in a tongue most of us could not understand. The sound of his grief was sharp and startling, filling what little space we had between us. For weeks, we had grown used to a low, miserable groaning, occasionally an outcry. Now, we had to adjust to this new desolate sorrow.

‘What do you remember?’ someone called out to the weeping man.

He choked back his sobs, his voice low but rigid as if daring the silence to swallow it. ‘Everything,’ he said. ‘My whole world. The land that carried me, the sun that warmed my back, the voices of my kin.’

For many of us, his words were a tangle of sounds, but soon another called out from the shadows, recognizing the familiar cadence.

‘Where do you come from?’

‘Anomabo. And you, friend?’

‘Assin Manso, near the great forest.’

There was a sudden, desperate joy in the way their voices met, like souls grasping for each other in the dark. As if stirred by this union, the ship began to shift beneath us. The shuffling above grew frantic, the murmur of the white men turning to shouts, sharp and urgent. Fear descended heavily, like a fog.

‘Tell us what makes you weep so? Tell us your memory,’ someone else called out.

The man hesitated, drawing a shaky breath. ‘I remember her,’ he said, his voice cracking under the weight of the words. His silence stretched, heavy and expectant, pressing down on all of us. When he spoke again, it was barely above a whisper. ‘I remember the woman I could never forget, even when the world tries to tear her from my mind.’

We all held our breath, listening. His words wrapped around us, pulling us closer, binding us to his grief. Slowly, we adjusted to their presence, letting ourselves sink into them as if they could carry us somewhere far from this dark, damp hold.

That was how the tellings began, each story birthing another. They warmed us, strengthened our aching limbs, eased our sores and flowed through our veins like healing currents. They cracked open the ship’s planks, letting in glimpses of the sky and the world we’d left behind.

So, we told them, and with each telling, the person seemed to gleam, like a star in the ship’s darkness.

We wanted to tell them to you, to share the light that still flickered, even here on the blackest of night.

 

the edge of the field

 

She was waiting for me every morning at the edge of the field, with a basket on her hip and a smile that could stop time. She was the daughter of old Nuru, the village healer, and she had her mother’s wisdom in her eyes.

I knew she had dreams – dreams that reached further than the fields we tended, beyond the life our people built together. Most would have been content with a husband, children, a home to care for, but not her. She wanted more. She wanted to heal the land, to find a way to bring the rains back, to make the earth fertile again. The dryness that crept into our village, cracking the soil and withering our crops, troubled her deeply.

She’d talk about it in the quiet moments when the day’s work was done, and the sky was an endless blue above us. She’d speak of roots that ran deep beneath the surface, of the power hidden in the earth, waiting to be unlocked. She believed there was a cure, something beyond the herbs her mother taught her to use, beyond the prayers whispered to the gods. She saw things others couldn’t – or maybe just wouldn’t.

But her ideas set her apart. The other women in the village didn’t understand why she cared so much about the land when there were babies to raise, meals to prepare, a husband to tend to. They thought her strange, always with her head tilted, listening for something no one else could hear. Some called her foolish; others, stubborn. But to me, she was a vision, a force that moved with quiet grace, and I loved her.

Her mother and father saw her dreams, her way of seeing the world, as something strange, something that would keep her apart from the rest. Old Nuru was respected, yes, but even she could not shield her daughter from the whispers, or the way people would look at her sideways, wondering what kind of woman cared more for plants and rain than for marriage and children.

I remember the day I asked. Her father, a quiet man with rough hands and a hard stare, sat across from me in their hut, sizing me up. I could see the doubt in his eyes, the way he hesitated before he spoke. ‘You know she is not like other girls,’ he said, as a warning. ‘She won’t change. If you marry her, you’ll have to live with all that comes with her – those strange ideas, the way she thinks.’

I did not hesitate. ‘I know,’ I told him. ‘That is why I want her.’

Her parents looked at each other, her mother’s brow furrowed, her lips pressed tight. I knew they loved her, but they didn’t know what to do with her, this daughter who was both a blessing and a mystery. In the end, they said yes, not because they believed I was the one who could make her happy, but because they feared she’d be alone otherwise. They thought I was the best chance she had.

And maybe I was. I didn’t care that others thought her strange, didn’t care if she didn’t fit the mould they had for a wife. To me, she was everything I never knew I needed. A wild, brilliant spark in a world that was sometimes too dark.

We built our life from the earth, the same way my father and his father did before me. I could see our sons growing tall, like the Kapok trees that shaded our village. She started planting things no one else bothered with – deep-rooted plants that didn’t wilt easily, herbs and flowers that seemed out of place among the rows of cassava and maize. She said they were medicine for the land. ‘The soil needs to breathe,’ she’d tell me, her eyes bright, full of conviction. ‘It needs to be healed, just like a body.’

I’d watch her, my heart swelling with a mix of pride and fear. I wanted to believe in her vision, but I also knew how the village talked. They saw her bending over those tiny green shoots, whispering to them, and they shook their heads.

‘What good are these plants?’ they’d say. ‘You can’t eat them.’

But she didn’t care. She tended her plants like they were children, watering them when everyone else said it was a waste, singing to them in the evenings, her voice low and soothing. And slowly, almost imperceptibly, the earth began to respond. There was a softness to it that hadn’t been there before, a hint of green where there had only been brown.

It wasn’t a miracle, and it was no work of god. But it was there – a promise, a beginning. Even though most people still didn’t understand, I knew she was onto something. I’d see her out there, standing in the field at dusk, the wind catching her braids, and I’d think she looked like she belonged to the land, like she was a part of it in a way none of us could ever be.

It happened quietly, like most things with her. One morning, she told me she was carrying our child. She said it with a calm certainty, her hand resting on her belly, and for a moment, I couldn’t breathe. A son, she said, and I believed her because she had that way of knowing things.

He was born under a moon that shone brighter than I’d ever seen, full and low, casting its silver light across the fields. She named him Amani, a name that meant peace.

I was remembering the last time I saw them together, sleeping. That morning, when I left, she woke and held onto me a moment longer. Her eyes searched mine as if she knew. I told her I’d be back by the next moon. I promised. And then I walked away, thinking I’d see her waiting there again, like always, at the edge of the field.

I wonder if she’s still there, waiting.

 

–

 

His words hung in the air. For a moment, all we could hear was each other’s breathing – a fragile, shared rhythm. The story had drawn out each of our griefs and gave it a shape in the dark, like smoke. But it didn’t last.

The ship groaned a deep sound that cut through the stillness. A tremor rippled through us, limbs shifting and chains scraping. The trance dissolved. We braced ourselves, for what was creeping closer. From a dark corner of the hold, another voice rose, trembling but resolute.

‘My people also struggled with the land,’ she said. ‘But unlike your woman, we didn’t try to heal it. We looked to the gods.’

Her voice was old and weathered, like wind whispering through ancient reeds.

 

the flood of prayers

 

We had prayed for the rains. For months, the land had cracked beneath our feet, the ground thirsty and splitting open like old clay. The river shrank to nothing more than a trickle, and the goats grew thin, their ribs pressing sharp against their hides. Every morning, we gathered at the center of the village, offering up our pleas to the sky, begging for mercy.

The elders led the prayers, their voices rising in unison, arms lifted to the heavens. We followed them, our own voices growing hoarse from the asking. We brought offerings of food, small though they were, and placed them in the center of the village, hoping the gods would see our need and answer us. Days passed. Then weeks. Still, the sky remained clear, unforgiving.

And then, the rains came.

At first, it was just light drops tapping against the ground, as though the gods were testing their gift. We rejoiced. Women danced with their arms stretched wide, faces lifted to feel the cool drops on their skin. Their ululations rose into the air, a joyful sound that echoed across the village, blending with the rhythm of the rain. The children ran barefoot through the village, laughing and splashing in the first muddy puddles. I stood there, watching the earth drink deeply. We thought it was salvation.

But by the next day, the sky had opened fully. The rain no longer fell softly but pounded the village relentlessly, as if all the water that had been withheld for months was now pouring down at once. The river swelled, rising faster than we could have imagined. Fields that had been barren were now drowning, the crops we had fought to save washed away.

At first, no one spoke of it. We thought the rains would pass and we tried to keep our spirits high, thanking the gods for answering our prayers. But in the quiet, when no one else was around, we whispered that maybe we had prayed too much.

I stood at the riverbank one evening, the rain still falling hard. The river, once a thin and struggling stream, had become a roaring, rushing beast. It tore at the banks, eating away at the land. I watched as one of our sacred trees lost its grip and fell into the water, swept away as if it had never stood there at all.

Was this the gods’ gift, we wondered, or their wrath?

We huddled together in our homes, listening to the rain batter the walls. No one said it aloud, but we all felt it – we had asked for mercy, and perhaps, in return, we had been given too much.

 

–

 

‘There’s water!’

It had been so soft during the old woman’s telling, like a memory unfolding, that we hadn’t noticed it at first. Not until it was up to our ankles.

‘It’s coming in,’ another voice shouted. ‘Look at the walls!’

Saltwater seeped through the cracks, snaking down the wood. We jolted – chains scraping, breaths quickening, fear spreading like ripples on water.

Somewhere in the shadows, a girl giggled softly. ‘Look at the froth! It’s like flowers,’ she said. Her voice was happy, confused, like the touch of a fever.

Another voice followed hers, cutting through the growing panic. ‘Yes, little one. They are like flowers.’

‘I knew flowers,’ the girl whispered, her voice floating above the murmurs, carrying an unsettling joy. ‘I picked them by the gate.’

‘Those flowers beyond the gate,’ the voice coaxed, ‘they hold memories, don’t they?’

‘Yes,’ the girl mused. ‘Maybe when the waters go, we’ll find new flowers waiting for us.’

The shouts above were drifting down – sharp bursts in the white man’s language – but we no longer heard them. The fear that had begun to rise among us softened, folding back into the darkness like the receding tide.

‘Tell us,’ the voice urged from the shadows. ‘Tell us about the flowers beyond the gate.’

And so, another story began, rising among us like a fragile bloom in the blackness, the words holding the sea back – for a little longer.

 

the flowers beyond the gate

 

I hadn’t planned on going far from the gate that day. The sun was stretching the shadows long and thin over the village. I could feel them watching me. They weren’t supposed to be that long yet. My basket pressed tight against my side, and I told myself to hurry – Kemi’s child would arrive soon, and I had to gather wild roots and leaves to ease her pain. They always trusted me for that.

I knew which roots to boil and which herbs to crush. The knowledge was planted deep, running through my blood, passed from my mother’s hands to mine, and hers before her. If I could just find the right roots, everything would be fine.

The guards stood at the gate, their spears glinting like teeth. Their eyes scanned the horizon. As long as I could see them, I was safe. I crouched low, fingers digging into the earth, pulling up the roots I needed. The Kankana roots, thick and gnarled, resisted at first. I pulled harder; Kemi would need them. The Kinkeliba leaves would make a bitter tea, one that could hold her through the hours of labour. These plants couldn’t grow inside the village – they choked the tame crops.

Then I saw it – Chinyika. Its bright petals – pink, red, and white – flaring like fire stars against the green. It wasn’t supposed to be here, not now, not with the air so dry. Things didn’t grow when the world was cracking open. And yet, there it was – waiting. I knew its roots could heal wounds, loosen the fever’s grip. But I also knew the guards smeared it on their spears. Just a scratch could turn blood against itself.

I glanced toward the guards again, telling myself it would only take a moment. The flowers weren’t far, just past the trees, only a little beyond where the earth breathes wild. If I was quick, no one would notice.

I stood and stepped off the path, slipping between the trees. The petals brushed my fingers, soft as silk. Their fragrance was sweet and strange, curling inside my chest like a song I couldn’t quite remember. I plucked a few, tucking them into my basket. But it wasn’t enough. I needed more.

The more I gathered, the more I wanted. The roots curled like sleeping snakes, delicate and dangerous, and I marvelled at their power – how something so beautiful could poison or save, depending on who held it.

It wasn’t until I looked up that I realized how far I’d gone. The guards were gone. The village, too. The air felt wrong – too still, too empty. My heart twisted inside my chest. I clutched the basket tight and ran, tripping over roots, rushing back toward the gate.

When I returned, the women gathered close, their hands reaching for the flowers and roots in my basket. I told them about the Chinyika – how it had bloomed bright and fierce. Too fierce for this season, but there it was just beyond the gate. Their eyes gleamed with understanding.

‘We should go tonight,’ one whispered urgently. ‘While the blooms are still fresh.’

But the guards stepped forward, blocking our way. ‘Not at night,’ they warned, their voices low. ‘It’s too dangerous. White devils stalk the land, snatching those who wander too far from the village.’

We laughed at them. ‘What’s this? Have our fearless warriors grown frightened of children’s tales?’ But their faces stayed grim, their hands tight on their spears. So we waited, promising ourselves that we’d go at dawn before the sun could steal the cool of the night.

When the first light touched the land, we rose early and hurried toward the grove. But when we reached the place where the flowers had burned so bright, they were gone. Not a petal, not a trace. Only the bare earth, empty and cracked, as if nothing had ever grown there.

As we turned back toward the gate, no one spoke. The only sound was the crunch of our feet on the dry earth, each step pressing the loss deeper into our bones. I told myself they were just flowers, but the thought didn’t feel true. Something else had been lost, something I couldn’t name.

 

–

 

For a moment, the girl’s strange laughing voice hung there, like a damp shroud. We had all heard it in her story – a hollow, distant quality, like the final hum of a broken instrument. It was the sound of something slipping away.

We had no way of knowing what she had lived through before now.

We realized, then, that the story she told wasn’t just a tale – it was perhaps her last memory. Or maybe it was the only memory she had left now that her mind had fractured. We understood, too, that she clung to it as if it were a lifeline – something solid in a world that had broken beneath her feet.

‘I knew flowers,’ the girl whispered again. ‘I picked them by the gate.’

Around us, the sea pressed harder against the wood, charging in from all sides like a great herd crashing through the planks. The saltwater swirled at our legs, cold and rising, but no one moved. No one complained. We sat still, waiting for the next voice to rise. Waiting for another story to tether us to our lost world a little longer.

And then, softly, it came: a voice from the dark, hesitant at first. ‘There was a boy,’ he began.

The ship groaned a low hollow sound that seemed to say I’m listening.

 

 the hunter’s hands

 

The voice was faint at first, barely cutting through the rush of water and creaking wood. Then it grew stronger.

‘There was a boy,’ it began again, ‘just six years old. Small and scrawny, but he had a fire in him, a fierceness he couldn’t yet hold in his little bones. He wanted to be a warrior, like his brothers. Wanted to run through the tall grass with a spear in his hand, to be strong and fearless. But they laughed, called him a reed that would snap in the wind. Still, he followed them, always trailing behind, eyes wide with wonder and stubbornness.’

A pause, and the voice trembled as if holding something too heavy to carry.

‘One evening, when the sun dipped low, and shadows stretched long across the earth, the brothers came back from hunting. But the boy was not with them. They searched, called his name, but there was no answer. He had snuck out, like he always did, thinking he could follow them, prove he was strong. Their mother . . . she was frantic, screaming his name, tearing at her hair. She knew there were wild things out there, creatures with teeth sharp as knives, eyes that glowed in the dark.’

The ship creaked as if responding. The water rose higher.

‘But it wasn’t just beasts with claws they feared. There were other things – white demons, we called them. Men who walked like shadows, who could take a child in the blink of an eye, and he’d be gone. Stolen away, as if he had never existed. They searched through the night, through the tangled brush, over rocks and streams, but they found nothing. Not even a single footprint. It was as if the earth had swallowed him whole.’

The voice softened, drifting like a breeze, and then grew stronger, carrying a new ache – hope.

‘They did not stop searching,’ the voice continued. ‘Far into the next day, they combed through the forest, called his name, listened for any sign, any whisper. And then, just as the sun began to set, they found him. He was sitting with his back against a tree, a porcupine in his lap, its spines bristling like a thousand tiny spears. His hands were a mess of cuts, raw and bleeding, but he didn’t flinch, didn’t pull away. His fingers moved carefully, plucking out the spines one by one, determined to skin the creature.

‘What are you doing?’ his brothers asked, relieved and frightened. And the boy, small and scrawny, looked up with eyes that held a quiet fire. ‘A hunter feeds his people,’ he said. ‘I wanted to bring something back, like you do. I can do it. I can help.’

They watched him, this boy with bloody hands, the porcupine slipping between his fingers, and they realized he had never been lost. He had been searching too, not for a way home, but for a way to prove he belonged. And in that moment, they saw not a child, but a warrior – one who might be small, but had a heart that was fierce, and hands that would not stop, even when they were trembling, even when they bled.

They carried him home, the porcupine tucked under his arm, and the whole village gathered to see. No one laughed. No one called him a reed. They saw his hands and understood what courage looked like. From that day, he was never left behind. For a hunter was not just the one who brought the biggest prey, but the one who would not give up, even when the task was painful, even when his hands bled.’

The voice softened to a whisper. ‘Sometimes, we are lost, not because we have wandered, but because we are searching. And sometimes, what we find is not what we thought we would, but it is enough. It is always enough.’

The water continued to rise, reaching our chests and necks, but the man speaking did not flinch. Slowly, he shifted, revealing a glint of metal in his hand, small and sharp, stained dark with old blood. ‘The boy was not the only one who learned to keep going,’ he said. ‘I carried this for weeks, hidden in the wound of my sole, waiting for a moment to set myself free. And tonight, I have.’

The metal shard slipped from his fingers, tapping the wooden floor with a muffled clink. It had done its job, prying at the links of his chains until they gave way. ‘A hunter feeds his people,’ he murmured, his eyes gleaming with a quiet, steady light. ‘And a warrior, no matter how small, finds a way.’

A murmur passed through us – a spark, faint but real. Deep in the belly of the ship, we started to hope again.

Our world did not end, you see. It bent, it broke, but it did not end. The sea could claim our bodies, but it could not drown the stories that held us, nor the spirit that kept us breathing.

We are still here, still breathing, still alive in our stories. They could not take that.

    "text": "I loved the anonymous chat app. I downloaded it on my computer. I downloaded it on my phone. I was lonely, and the anonymous chat app made me less lonely. I couldn’t sleep, and the anonymous chat app said, Who cares! When I felt helpless, when I despaired, when my breath caught horribly in my chest, the anonymous chat app told me: The whole world suffers. Everyone is unemployed. The whole world is sexless inside of its body. The whole world longs for sleep. When it sleeps, the whole world has terrible nightmares. And when it wakes, the whole world is so, so grateful for the opportunity to chat privately with strangers online.

The anonymous chat app sported a clean and gorgeous interface. Its colors were green and blue and white. The font, serif-less. Everything glowed, comforting and familiar, like a chain hotel. At the end of each session I watched the chat window melt away, pixels dissolving, irretrievable. I knew all the lingo. A/S/L. Bots telling me to add them on a different messenger app called Kik. I wasn’t stupid. I didn’t use Kik. But I liked the bots anyway; it was cool that they were fake, and cool that I knew they were fake, and cool that whoever designed the bots probably knew that I would know they were fake and want to talk to them anyway.

The first time I chatted with a bot I just wanted to see what would happen.

Hello, I typed.

I love you, I typed.

Im gonna kill you, I typed.

And the bot said:

gtg, add me on kik ; )

gtg, add me on kik ; )

gtg, add me on kik ; )

 

Whenever I was connected to a real person we would exchange age and sex and location and then either I or the other person would say How are you and then one of us would say Are you horny. I lied about my age and I lied about my location and I lied about being horny. The only thing I didn’t lie about was my gender. I’m Henry, I said. I’m Geoff. I said that I was twenty-five. I said that I was forty-seven. I said that I lived in Detroit or Toronto or Berlin. I said that I was horny, really horny, extremely horny. Most of the time I didn’t masturbate. Anyone could be a fat old guy getting off on tricking me, and I worried about what it would mean to fondle myself while aware of this possibility.

Besides, I wasn’t horny. When I looked down at my body, I was often surprised to find that it was still there. All day long my body dragged me around. It sat me on the couch. It took me to the bathroom. In exchange I gave it food and water and rest. Sometimes I gave it drugs, and sometimes I made it lift heavy objects and set them down so that it could stay strong. But I continued to suspect that my body was angry with me. Nothing I did seemed good enough. I was angry with my body, too. It was holding me back.

Here was the truth: I was a thirty-four-year-old male. I lived in Brooklyn Heights. I was 6’1. I was a healthy weight. I had a nice-looking face. I had money. I wore brown loafers and chinos. I wanted to be free. I wanted to be a mind.

 

I was in the bathroom one evening, sitting on the toilet with my pants on and my laptop balanced on my thighs, waiting for the chat app to pair me with someone new. My wife was out on a run. Earlier I had considered taking the subway to a bar in Gowanus, but then I remembered the dirty drifts of last week’s snowfall piled at every intersection, and I thought about all of the strangers and all of the bots out there, all over the world, waiting to meet me. So instead I sat in the bathroom, sipping a canned margarita from the deli across the street, and took some selfies on my laptop camera.

Everything was fine. I had washed the sheets that morning. My wife and I had recently purchased an expensive toaster oven, known for its innovative crisping technology, and I had developed the habit of cutting frozen pizzas in half with scissors and broiling each segment separately. This technique was much faster than waiting for the real oven to preheat. A half-moon of pepperoni pizza rested on a paper towel in the bathroom sink, and once it cooled down it was going to taste delicious.

I should have prefaced this by saying that I loved my wife. She was beautiful. She was smart. She had a low, calm voice. We met at a Starbucks six years earlier and at our wedding reception we gave out personalized ceramic Starbucks travel tumblers. Aww, the guests had said, and they were right. The personalized ceramic Starbucks travel tumblers were adorable. My wife was Jewish and in law school, but she wasn’t argumentative, not really. She was small, with long dark hair that she parted in the middle to appear more authoritative. She wore these tight black skirt suits to work. At home she zoomed around the kitchen muttering to herself. Fuck, where did I put my keys, fuck fuck fuck god damn it has anyone seen my keys, did I forget to put on deodorant, shit shit I think I smell. I loved listening to her curse. The words sounded wrong coming out of her sweet, earnest mouth.

Whenever I looked at my wife it was as if my intestines got caught in my throat. The previous year I had participated in several unsatisfying affairs when she was away visiting her dying mother upstate. I had still been sort of horny back then, but that wasn’t why I cheated. I did it because my wife was having a hard time. ‘I’m so sad. Fuck! I’m so fucking sad!’ she would say, and her eyes would be red and wet, and I would hear her gasping and crying all over the apartment. In these moments it was clear that she had made a terrible mistake in marrying me. I didn’t know how to make her feel better; I didn’t even want to try. I’m so horrible, I told myself. I’m a piece of shit. I’m the kind of piece of shit who would probably cheat on his wife while her mother was dying.

The first time she went upstate I headed to a bar and picked up a girl, and the next time she went upstate I did it again. I always went back to the girls’ places. I didn’t want my doorman to see that I was unfaithful. The girls lived in Bushwick and Bed-Stuy, in filthy walk-ups with four roommates, hordes of ugly potted plants lunging for sunlight in the common areas, empty cans of diet Red Bull repurposed as ashtrays on the windowsills. I was aware that when those girls fucked me it was sort of as a joke. They wanted to laugh with their friends about my pressed trousers, my polished shoes, my pomade. I didn’t care. I had a lot of affection for them. I was pathetic, but they were, too. One had a big fat roach living in her bathtub drain, and it would pop out whenever someone went to pee. She was too scared to kill it and had instead trained herself to think of it as a pet. She was nuts, but I liked her, and I felt guilty when her blow job didn’t make me come.

Then my wife’s mother died and I stopped going home with girls. My body screamed at me all the time. Stop! it screamed. Go! I became very depressed. For a while I had panic attacks at the office every time my computer froze. I would stare at the unmoving screen and think, Nothing ever works and everybody is going to die. Then my heart would start flapping around inside of me at an awful speed. I would plead with my body, Do not do this while I am at work! and my body would laugh in my face. Eventually my company put me on paid leave. My wife was kind and supportive. She reminded me to take my Ativan.

In the bathroom I sipped my margarita and stared at the blank chat window on my laptop. Whoever was on the other end wasn’t saying anything, so I typed, A/S/L??

The stranger took a moment to respond. I steadied my laptop with one hand and with the other reached into the sink for my pizza.

MY CAPS LOCK IS STUCK

I HAVE REMOVED THE KEY AND CLEANED IT AND RESTARTED MY COMPUTER BUT NOTHING IS WORKING

Sorry, I typed. I dont know how to help . . . a/s/l??

THATS OKAY I JUST DONT WANT YOU TO THINK I AM YELLING AT YOU

MY NAME IS DIANE I AM A FEMALE I AM 37 YEARS OLD AND I LIVE IN QUEENS

My fingers thrummed on the keyboard. This person had no idea how to use the internet. And even though she had explained about the caps lock, it still came across as yelling. Plus, I didn’t generally like to talk to anyone over thirty-five. Ever since my thirty-fourth birthday I had sensed myself on a slippery, frightening edge.

I was about to disconnect when she messaged me again.

PLEASE DONT LEAVE. I REALLY NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO. I AM GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE. MY HUSBAND LEFT ME FOR A YOUNGER AND MORE ATTRACTIVE WOMAN. I DONT KNOW WHAT I DID TO DESERVE THIS. I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT I AM A DANGER TO MYSELF. IF ONE MORE PERSON LEAVES ME I WILL PROBABLY KILL MYSELF. I DO HAVE A BOTTLE OF SLEEPING PILLS. I AM SORRY FOR PUTTING YOU IN A DIFFICULT POSITION. DIANE

I set my pizza back down in the sink. This was not what the anonymous chat app was all about. I didn’t want to be responsible for anyone’s suicide. Then again, she was likely lying about killing herself. Recently, I had also told my wife that I was going to buy a gun on the dark web and shoot myself in the throat so that I would no longer be a burden. I needed to make sure she was aware that she could lose me at any moment, that it was still her responsibility to love me, even though I had become a helpless and bitter person.

I got up off the toilet and lay down in the bathtub with the laptop on my stomach. The sensation of the cold ceramic against my neck made me feel miserable but alive.

HELLO??

Sorry, I was in the bathroom, I typed. You should call the suicide hotline.

I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO CALL THEM BECAUSE I KNOW IT IS THEIR JOB TO TELL ME NOT TO KILL MYSELF

IT ALL STARTED WITH MY MOTHER WHO NEVER LOVED ME AND RESENTED ME UNTIL THE DAY SHE DIED. BECAUSE OF HER I HAVE DEVELOPED AN ANXIOUS-PREOCCUPIED ATTACHMENT STYLE. I DRIVE EVERYONE AWAY WITH MY INSECURITIES AND HYPER-DEPENDENCE

AT FIRST I THOUGHT MY HUSBAND WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WHEN REALLY HE WASNT BUT I KEPT CONFRONTING HIM ABOUT IT UNTIL HE FINALLY HAD AN AFFAIR FOR REAL ISNT THAT CRAZY

Damn, I typed. Your husband sucks!!

She kept going. Her husband had left her four months ago and she sometimes got lonely at night but didn’t want to talk to people she knew, because she hated when they felt sorry for her. I felt really sorry for her. She was much crazier and sadder than I was, had a worse life, and kept apologizing, over and over again. It was nice talking to her.

I thought, Maybe I can do something. Maybe I can make this insane lady feel better. Maybe this is my job.

So I told her some lies about myself. I said I was an orphan. I said that dating was hard for me because I was ugly.

ALL THOSE GIRLS DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY’RE MISSING, she said.

I thought, Good thing she doesn’t know I’m actually handsome.

I was about to reply when I heard a knock on the bathroom door.

‘Baby?’ my wife said. ‘You okay?’

‘I’m just chilling in here,’ I said loudly. ‘Might take a bath.’

‘Sounds good,’ she said, in a voice that meant: It doesn’t sound good, it sounds weird, there’s no water running, it kind of smells like pizza, but I’m patient, I’m nice, I love you, I’m your wife.

When I heard her footsteps recede, I returned to the screen. It was getting late. My back felt sore. My canned margarita was warm and my pizza was cold. But I didn’t want to stop talking to Diane. I was helping her. It was so good to be helpful. The more I helped her, the more I wanted her to help me, too. I wanted to tell her things, true things, about myself. And I did. I sat up in the bathtub and typed quickly, hunched over my laptop. I told Diane about how my company had recently made the move into a coworking space in the city, with ping-pong tables and a booth in the lobby where you could craft your own Christmas ornaments. There was a bar and lounge area, and a room where people danced to music wearing headphones. I had encouraged the move so as to increase staff wellness and productivity, but once we arrived I started having panic attacks after drinking one beer at the bar on my lunch break. I told her how the panic attacks continued even after I stopped drinking my lunchtime beer, and how one day I began shrieking in the lobby and then smashed my handmade ornament on the floor and that’s why I got put on leave. I didn’t tell her the leave was paid because I didn’t want to make her feel insecure about our class disparity.

I AM SORRY YOU ARE OUT OF WORK

IN MY STATE I FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD DOWN A JOB

That blows, I typed. You deserve so much better.

It was two in the morning when we both logged off. We exchanged emails, mine with a fake name that I had set up for such situations. My eyeballs felt stretched out from staring at my screen all night. Ow, my body said, and I said, Shut the fuck up. When I stood up from the bathtub my muscles were stiff and cramped. But there was something else, too – a slackness in the vicinity of my ribcage that I hadn’t experienced in months. A feeling like a fist opening.

Diane, I thought.

My wife lay sprawled on top of our white duvet. She was wearing two sweaters, fleece-lined sweatpants, and a pair of sparkly, fuzzy socks. I lay beside her, and she shifted to wrap her thin arms around my waist. Her breath was wet on my neck. It smelled like sour milk. Recently my wife had got into intermittent fasting and she only ever ate one meal a day, at 7 p.m., but every day at 7 p.m. she microwaved the greasiest foods she could find: mac and cheese, corn dogs, soggy hamburgers that steamed offensively in their cellophane packets. At 6.55 p.m. she would spread everything out on the kitchen table and look at it and nod and say, ‘Fuck yes. Hell fucking yes.’ And then I would watch her shovel down her burgers and corn dogs and laugh, and go, ‘Shit, I’m gonna get heartburn,’ and take three Tums and one Lactaid, and, later, massage her swollen stomach on the couch while concentrating on a Scandinavian crime drama, expressing shock at the appropriate moments, shaking her head, saying, ‘That is fucked up.’ When I watched her I could almost forget about my horrible body, the twisting, grasping panic inside of me, the Ativan, the other women, the strangers, the bots. I could almost forget about the gorgeous anonymous chat app, which was always within reach, always waiting for me, on my laptop, on my phone.

I could almost say, I love being a husband. I love my beautiful wife.

Beside me in bed, a loose strand of hair had caught in my wife’s mouth. She was kneading her lips, pushing at the hair with her tongue. I closed my eyes and the image of her face went black, like my phone’s screen when untouched. It was not a face I could bear to see.

Instead I thought, Diane.

 

The next morning I saw that my wife had left me a note on her pillowcase.

Hooray!!! it said. You slept!!

She had sketched a horizontal stick figure with little Zs floating above its head. I stared at it for a minute. It looked just like me. I pushed away the vision of my wife’s fingers grasping the fine-tipped pen, pressing delicately into the pad. In my dreams my phone had been buzzing interminably against my thigh. It had been bleating Diane’s name. I glanced around the room. My skin tingled where it sat on top of my muscles. My muscles throbbed where they sat on top of my bones. There was a spider in the corner of the ceiling, and I kept looking at it and crying. I had been listening to a lot of Steely Dan. I couldn’t understand why the spider hadn’t spun a web. It was in the corner with no web. I felt guilty about every affair I had ever had. I was letting down my wife and all of her friends. I didn’t have friends anymore, but if I did, I would have been letting them down, too. And not just the friends I might have had. I was letting down all the strangers and all the wonderful bots in the world. I was letting down my new confidante, Diane.

I lurched out of bed and took my Ativan and chugged half a bottle of cold brew, then stood in the middle of the kitchen and waited for the drug to hit, that first surge of relief like a wet rag being wrung out in my brain. I looked around at our apartment. My wife had decorated in various shades of gray: slate, charcoal, a luminescent pearl for the kitchen cabinets. In the living room were a handwoven viscose rug in a color called Fog and a low-slung linen couch with a burnt orange throw arranged artfully across one cushion. The throw was cashmere, and in the early hours I liked to swaddle myself in it front-to-back, like an armless Snuggie. Our kitchen table was Danish and modern. My wife had let me pick it out. ‘I have veto power,’ she had said, ‘in case you choose something ugly.’ But I didn’t choose something ugly, and when she saw the table she had looked shiny and proud, like a mother whose kid had received unexpectedly kind comments on his report card.

‘My sister’s going to shit herself when she sees how nice our place is,’ she had said.

I opened the fridge and found a Tupperware on the top shelf filled with hardboiled eggs. My wife had cracked the shells lightly beforehand, so all I had to do was peel. I pictured her running the eggs under cold water in the early morning, tapping them gently on the countertop until their exteriors fissured while I was asleep. My eyes welled up. I chipped away at the shell, then peeled the egg by its membrane and popped it whole into my mouth.

I lay on the couch with my head against the scratchy side of a throw pillow and opened my laptop. Outside it was below freezing, but we kept the heat at 75, even in midwinter. My wife was always cold and sometimes went to sleep wearing her knee-length down parka.

The laptop fan whirred frighteningly. The underside of the keyboard was warm on my bare legs. Too hot, my body said. I closed the laptop and opened it again, but the fan wouldn’t stop. I threw the computer down onto the cushion. The fan shut off. Gingerly I pried the laptop open and began to draft an email.

 

Dear Diane,

I forgot to tell you yesterday to try listening to some Steely Dan. I would recommend starting with the 1972 album Can’t Buy a Thrill. I have found it very comforting in my lowest moments.

It was really great talking to you last night. Lately I’ve been feeling very confused. I feel like I’m going crazy. I hope you are doing better this morning. I think that you should flush your sleeping pills. Do you ever feel sexually lonely now that your divorce is underway?

Please get back to me ASAP.

Best,
Ken

 

I hit send and immediately started refreshing my empty inbox. I thought about the eggs. I thought about how so many people in the world were married and so many people in the world were not. I thought about the hundreds of thousands of users on the anonymous chat app, and how many of them were uglier than me, and how many were more handsome, and how many had more money, and how many had less, and how many were horny, and how many were frigid, and then my body said, You need to stop thinking about this or else you are going to have a panic attack.

I thought about Diane. I thought about what she might smell like. I imagined her apartment in Queens, probably un-renovated since the 1972 release of Can’t Buy a Thrill. I imagined yellowed bathroom tiles and wall-to-wall carpeting smudged with weird, unidentifiable stains, and an ugly black velour couch with potato chip crumbs lodged between the cushions. I imagined walking in and saying, Wow, it looks great in here, I love the decor, and how happy she would be to hear that. I thought about her puckered breasts hanging limpidly beneath a dirty tank top, my fingers tracing the flesh that protruded over her sweatpants, slipping under the band, grabbing a fistful of her pubic hair.

My cell phone buzzed. It was my boss. I sent him to voicemail, waited for the message to come through, and deleted it.

I called my wife, even though I knew she couldn’t pick up at work. I pressed the phone hard against my ear.

The phone said, ‘Please leave a message after the tone.’

‘Hey,’ I said. ‘It’s me.’

I hung up. I called again. The ringing sounded like what I imagined those meditation singing bowls must sound like, not so much a noise as a dull, low throb at the back of the skull.

 

The next morning I woke up frenzied and strung out. In bed I checked my laptop; Diane had yet to respond. I had spent most of the previous night hiding out in the bathroom, connecting and reconnecting to strangers on the anonymous chat app, failing to find her, until I stumbled to bed around two.

My wife was awake in the kitchen, slathering a toasted bagel with low-fat cream cheese for me. I had forgotten that it was the weekend. She poured herself a mug of coffee and measured out a few drops of stevia, then sat across from me at the table, handing me my Ativan bottle. I heard the pills rattling around like seeds. I was getting low.

‘What were you dreaming about last night?’ my wife asked. She looked beautiful in her silk bathrobe. Her hair was frizzy and pulled up in a clip. Behind her reading glasses I could see bits of yellow crust fuzzing the corners of her eyes.

‘I wasn’t dreaming,’ I said. ‘I didn’t sleep.’

She took a sip of her coffee and sucked it through her teeth before swallowing. ‘Yes, you did. I woke up for a minute at four and you were sleeping.’

‘No, I was just pretending to sleep so you wouldn’t worry,’ I said.

‘You were twitching and screaming,’ my wife said.

‘I wish you wouldn’t confuse your dreams with reality,’ I said, and then I laughed to say, Ha ha, you always do this! You’re so crazy! My crazy wife!

Her mouth tightened. ‘Okay,’ she said. She finished her coffee and started toward the dishwasher, then turned back and pointed at my untouched bagel. ‘Are you going to eat that?’

‘Yes,’ I said. I looked at the bagel. Something sour rose up in my throat.

‘If you don’t,’ she said, ‘if you change your mind, will you wrap it in aluminum and put it in the fridge? Instead of leaving it out or throwing it away? I’ll eat it for dinner.’

My body said, Don’t eat that bagel, it’s going to make you throw up. My wife looked at me like, I’m a good wife, I’m so patient, I’m so loving, even though my husband is a piece of shit. I picked up the bagel and tore off a hunk with my molars. The cream cheese spread like glue in my mouth. I forced myself to chew until it was soft enough to swallow. A wad of wet bread lodged in my throat. I went in for another bite.

‘Jack, what the fuck?’ my wife said.

‘I have to go to the bathroom,’ I said. I went to the bathroom and turned on the faucet, then knelt in front of the porcelain toilet bowl and stared into the still, clear water. You are a monk, I thought. You are meditating. My stomach roiled but I didn’t puke. When I rose I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. My face was the face of a ghost. My eyes were bleary and red. My chin was bloated and there were gleaming pink pustules dotting my throat. I looked very bad. I looked insane.

I heard a soft knock at the bathroom door.

‘Are you okay?’ My wife asked. ‘Can I get you some water?’

‘I’m fine,’ I screamed.

When she spoke again her voice was shrill. ‘Shut up! Just shut the fuck up! Be fucking normal! What the fuck do you do in the bathroom all the time! Jesus fucking Christ! I am trying so fucking hard over here!’

I noticed that I was sitting on the floor. This is where I want to be, said my body. My chest clenched. My hands vibrated. My body said, She’ll be sorry she yelled at you, she’ll feel terrible, and then it said, How about some more Ativan?

Okay, I thought. It’s time for me to say some crazy shit.

I said, ‘I want you to leave this house. I need you to walk out the door and stay away for at least three nights. I need to be alone so that I can breathe. I’m getting tired of your delusions. I don’t know how to help you.’

I was glad there was a closed door between us. I didn’t want to watch her eyes grow wet, the little pink shock of her mouth opening. I didn’t want to think about her doing nice things for me, like toasting my bagel. I didn’t want to remember how we had once talked about having two kids, but would end up having zero kids, because nothing in the world would leave me alone. My body wouldn’t leave me alone and my brain wouldn’t leave me alone. My job wouldn’t leave me alone. The spider on the bedroom ceiling wouldn’t leave me alone.

My wife said, ‘Fuck you.’

I waited until I heard her leave the apartment. I splashed cold water on my face and opened my email.

 

Dear Diane, I wrote.

I don’t want to accuse you of anything but I am feeling a little used. If you are alive please respond to me. I miss you.

Best wishes,
Ken

 

I dragged a flattering photo of myself from my photo library into the message body. In the background you could make out some of the colorful, modern canvases my wife had hung without frames on the living room walls. Diane would see that I was attractive with a well-decorated apartment.

I refreshed my email, then closed my laptop and took an Ativan. I was excruciatingly bored and, at the same time, restless and agitated, as if my blood was pumping too quickly through the canals of my veins. I thought, I am capable of having fun. I am a handsome young man. I’m single! I went to the kitchen and swallowed a second Ativan. I could feel my insides sloshing around, wetly and warmly. I looked down at my hands and thought, Incredible! Skin! There was skin all over me, holding me together inside of the atmosphere. As long as I had skin, everything would stay in place. My guts would not fall out into a slimy red pile on the floor. I was overcome with gratitude and feelings of celestial wellbeing. I checked on the spider in the bedroom. He was doing well. He looked really happy.

I connected my phone to the speaker my wife had bought for my thirty-first birthday, put on Can’t Buy a Thrill, and turned the volume up to seventeen.

I was singing along and feeling great. I even jumped up and down a few times. I hoped that my neighbors would hear and sing along and feel good, too. I just wanted to make other people happy. That was all I had ever wanted. That was all I had ever tried to do for Diane.

I swayed my hips and poked at my phone. One new text from my wife. She was sorry she had snapped at me. I swiped. I scrolled. Maybe some space would be good, she said. I blocked her number. I imagined her standing next to me in the kitchen, putting her hair up and then taking it down. I imagined myself screaming, How could you do it? How could you abandon me? How could you leave me alone with my body? You’ll never get the apartment!

And I imagined her crying, saying, I’m so sorry! I’m so sorry I treated you like that when you’re clearly going through a difficult period! I love you so much! Nothing you could ever do would make me mad at you! Even if you cheated on me more than three times! Please forgive me!

I sank onto the couch. Where could she be going? Maybe her sister’s house in Jersey. I smiled thinking about my wife alone in a guest bedroom, bickering with her sister’s husband about the heat, secretly cranking up the thermostat at night, commuting into the city each morning on NJ transit, changing into her heels in a sticky Penn station bathroom. She was getting older every day. The lack of vitamins was starting to show in the whites of her eyes. I laughed and got off the couch and grabbed a broom. I went into my bedroom and tried to smash the spider with the broom handle, but it escaped me, scurrying crazily across the ceiling. I threw the broom to the floor. I thought about my life. My life went something like this:

I love you!

Don’t leave me!

Get out!

Gtg!

Add me on Kik!

I lay on the bed and closed my eyes. The mattress supported my body. My skin remained in its place. I stayed like that for a few minutes. I was ready, but I wanted to hold on, if only for another moment.

When I opened my eyes I felt perfectly calm. I went into the bathroom and shook my final Ativan into my hand. I had forgotten to pick up my refill, but I knew it wouldn’t be a problem. I was getting well. I washed my face with my wife’s jelly cleanser and ran a comb through my hair and tended to my beard with an electric trimmer. I clipped my nails into the toilet and flushed. I patted rosehip toner onto my cheeks and forehead. I checked the mirror. I was looking solid and handsome, en route to extreme health. My chin already appeared less bloated. I returned to the bedroom and rifled through the closet. I put on clean chinos and a hunter green Oxford button-down. I opened my laptop’s lid.

 

Dear Diane, I wrote,

It’s been such a pleasure getting to know you. I was wondering if you believe that digital mediation has gone too far. Do you have faith in the possibility of seeing and being seen? I forgot to mention that I am going through a devastating and messy divorce from my beautiful Jewish wife.

It would be nice if you came and stayed here for a while. Do you like smoothies? I just ordered a very powerful new blender. I would be happy to pay for your movers, a cab, anything you need.

Looking forward to seeing you tonight!

All the best,
Ken

 

I added a postscript with my address and apartment number. I called down to the doorman to tell him that a woman would be arriving soon with luggage and to send her right up.

I shut down my computer and turned off my phone. I sat at the kitchen table and waited. The sun cast slats of shimmering light across the granite countertop.

I thought, That’s the ugliest thing I’ve ever seen.

 

I woke up with my right cheek pressed against the table and that side of my face covered in drool. It was dark, and I couldn’t remember what day it was. I turned on the overhead light and checked the time. Only six in the evening. I splashed some water on my face. More Ativan, my body screamed. I wanted to explain that I couldn’t, that there was no more, but my body didn’t understand reason or logic. My body offered no sympathy. It did not pity the circumstances of my existence. Ativan, it screamed. I pressed a hand over each ear. My brain was pudding in my skull. Slowly I inched my way over to the couch. I checked my email. Nothing from Diane.

I flipped on the TV and landed on one of the crime shows my wife liked. I couldn’t figure out what was going on. There was a large boat. There was a vicious sex-trafficker. There were vast expanses of gray water. I lay on the couch and wrapped myself in the blanket, dozing. I thought, Diane, you bitch.

Around eight I was jolted awake by a series of loud knocks at the front door. My head throbbed. I straightened my shirt and stumbled over.

In the hallway stood a girl, 18 or 19, wearing platform boots and knee-length denim shorts over a pair of ripped fishnet tights. She was skinny except for a slight thickness around the thighs, dimples at the sides of her hips. Her hair appeared to have been cheaply bleached, dark and oily at the roots, and she had arched, drawn-in eyebrows, a scary amount of purple eyeshadow smeared out and around her lower lid. She looked Greek, maybe, or Armenian, and would have been pretty if she scraped off her makeup. She was sucking on some kind of pungently fruity hard candy. Her eyes were a warm shade of brown. They frightened me.

‘Nice place,’ she said.

‘Thanks,’ I said. I peeked around her to see that she hadn’t brought any luggage. She sidled past me, not noticing or caring when her small breasts brushed my torso, and tossed a worn-out tote bag onto the kitchen table. She scanned the room, made a satisfied clicking sound with her tongue, and dropped onto the couch. With both hands she unzipped her boots, then placed them neatly on the floor, kicking her legs up and onto the ottoman. Her tights cut off at the ankles. She had small, dainty feet.

I was so thirsty. I wanted to vomit. My face felt like it was not my face. My face felt like it was maybe an old mound of Play-Doh.

My eyes landed on the girl’s toenails, which were painted black, with a glittery green star pasted on each big toe.

One part of me thought, Get this person the fuck out of your house. Call your wife. Say sorry. Tell her you’re sick. Tell her you’re crazy. Tell her you will finally complete that self-help workbook on black-and-white thinking. Fall onto your knees, you stupid motherfucker. Find God.

But another part of me thought, Ha ha! Fuck you! Maybe later!

I walked toward the girl. With every step I thought, My legs are like big sloppy tree trunks. I must have had a weird expression on my face because she started giggling. I could smell the laugh leaking out of her mouth, extending itself towards me.

‘I know,’ she said. ‘I look young for my age.’ She stored the candy in one side of her mouth while she spoke. It pressed against the inside of her cheek, a tumor that shifted from side to side when she parted her lips.

‘Do you want something to drink?’ I asked stupidly. My legs continued to carry me in her direction. The more I looked at her the more her face seemed to swim away from me. I searched her eyes for a hint of Diane.

‘Can I have a tissue?’

Slowly I made my way to the kitchen. I grabbed a paper towel and handed it to her. She spat out a tiny, translucent candy shard, then gave the crumpled towel back to me. I didn’t know what to do with it, so I shoved it in my chinos pocket. I wished that I could sit down next to her and lay my head in her lap, but my body couldn’t remember how to do anything except stand there, staring.

‘I don’t think you’re Diane,’ I said finally. Then I said, ‘Do you happen to have any Ativan?’

She looked at me sadly. ‘No, I don’t.’ She got up off the couch and walked toward me, then stopped when our faces were six inches apart. Her skin smelled like cigarettes and lemon-scented cleaning supplies. I wanted to reach out and peel the cracking foundation off her face in strips.

‘You’re too young. You’re too young and I don’t think you’re going through a divorce,’ I said.

She crossed her arms over her small chest. ‘If you don’t believe me, then I’ll just leave.’ She reached for her boots.

‘No!’ I said. ‘No, don’t go. I believe you.’

She shook her head. ‘Ken,’ she said, ‘this is never going to work if you don’t trust me. We have to trust each other. Trust is the foundation of love. Are you listening?’

I studied her face. I looked around my clean, well-decorated apartment. I thought, There is no way she is Diane.

Then my body said, Maybe she will give you a massage, though. Maybe she really likes you.

‘Yes,’ I said.

‘I’m here to help you. That’s all I’ve ever wanted to do.’

‘Okay,’ I said.

‘First, we have to get you cleaned up. Where’s your bathroom?’

‘It’s right around the corner,’ I said.

I watched the net of her tights digging into her calves as she went off in search of the room. When she found it, she smiled at me and closed the door behind her. I heard the brief rush of her piss, then the toilet flush and the bathwater running. After a while, she came back out and beckoned me towards her.

I followed her into the bathroom. It was humid and foggy with steam. The scent of lavender and lemongrass hung heavy over the tub, cut through by the faint grassy odor of urine. I glanced at the trash and saw that she had used up my wife’s bath salts.

‘Take off your clothes,’ she said, still smiling. I hesitated, then peeled off my chinos and my boxer briefs. I tried not to look at my penis hanging limp between my thighs. She helped me unbutton my shirt and lifted it over my head.

‘Good,’ she said. ‘Now get in.’

I stepped into the tub and stood submerged up to my calves, waiting for my body to adjust to the heat. The water felt slippery around my legs. I lowered myself slowly, crouching at first like a dog taking a shit, then letting myself lie down fully. The bathwater came up to my chin.

Diane nodded at me from above. ‘You stay here as long as it takes.’

‘Thanks,’ I said, and I moved my face into what I hoped could realistically be called a smile. I watched Diane kneel to gather my discarded clothes. I knew everything that was going to happen the moment before it happened. How she would leverage her weight against one hand, pushing herself from the tiles, reaching for the doorknob, my dirty underwear tucked under her armpit. And how I would raise myself onto my knees, my torso leaning out over the tub, my hand following her, straining, extending, dripping, the fingers wrapping around her left ankle and holding tight.

Diane’s mouth made the smallest sound I had ever heard. There was water on the floor. I felt her ankle churn in my fist. I looked at the hairs on the back of my arm, which were so beautiful, so silky and dark. Was Diane crying? No. No one here was crying. I had already let go. The door had already clicked shut.

I closed my eyes and sank back into the tub, loosening my jaw and parting my lips, letting the bathwater slide into my mouth. I heard a faint series of rustles and thumps from the kitchen, the opening and closing of drawers and cabinets, things banging into other things, things being moved, footsteps padding from room to room, things being thrown onto the floor, things being retrieved, unzipped, re-zipped. I made a mental inventory of all the objects around the apartment: my laptop, my wallet, my phone. It wasn’t true that trust was the foundation of love. Love had no foundation. It soared above me, untethered, an awful blimp. I heard paper rubbing against itself, Diane’s human exhale, Diane’s human voice saying shit, Diane’s human laugh, the front door opening, the front door closing. I could feel my pores widening, the dirt of my life washing out of me, rising with the steam and filtering through the ceiling vent. I reached above me for a bar of soap but it slipped from my wet hand. I watched it sink to the bottom of the tub before dipping my arm down to pick it up. I started to wash myself. The soap slid out of my hand once more.

Oh well, I thought.

I plunged my hand back into the water. I groped around.

I can’t find it, I thought. It’s gone.

But then I found it. I lifted it out of the water. I held on tight. I didn’t drop it again."

    "text": "She collected stamps when she was younger, then switched to books, degrees, and – when she moved abroad – white lovers. Later she returned to the familiar, and turned to teas. The careful, deliberate steps of preparing her tea became a habit, and, as with most habits, it was folded in with ingredients and histories preceding her.

She bought teas from regular stores and specialty houses, on errands to the local grocer and visits to her home island. Friends indulged her and added to her hodgepodge collection. Once, on her birthday, a lover took her on a surprise trip to the Davenport and Sons tea house, and she came back home with quite the loot. In this way, we grew into uneven rows of boxes and tins on her shelves, a dry garden tended by love and ritual.

Back home on her island, household altars were commonplace, erected in a special room in the house or assembled in a dedicated corner of the living room. Some altars housed statues and images of goddesses, garlanded with flowers. Others held pungent incense and the photographs and personal belongings of dear departed ones. Irreverently, Durga liked to think that her boxes and tins, fragrant and framed by a pell-mell of old teapots and chipped mugs, were her altar.

Then she gave us up. We know exactly when it happened.

It was when Durga came back from Dadi’s funeral in Mauritius. Her grandmother’s passing had emptied her heart of home, even as her travel bags were heavy with the familiar foods of her childhood. Sifting through them, she carefully removed a sealed envelope and an unassuming blue box labelled ‘Bois Chéri Vanilla Tea’. She placed both at the back of the shelves, behind the rest of us, hidden from view. She threw out the food. And then, as if the newcomers had tainted us with their presence, she avoided us for a long while. Almost a decade elapsed as we gathered dust and waited patiently.

Then Mama left the island and moved in with Durga, to the island in Massachusetts. The day she arrived, she dug out the blue box from behind the lot of us and proceeded to make tea in the same manner she had done every day of her life back in Mauritius. She flavoured it with cardamom pods, crushed lemongrass roots, and the Red Cow milk powder she had brought with her. A simple family recipe. The familiar hustle and bustle drew Durga to the kitchen. Mama had made her a cup without asking, which soothed and irked her in equal measure. She brought the cup to her lips and inhaled.

Durga had moved from island to island, up socially and away from familiarity, discarding everything except for her journals – and us. She started writing as a teenager, and kept the habit well into adulthood. Her journals recorded her life (les filles à l’école ont remarqué mes chaussures Nike, ça valait la peine d’avoir économisé mon argent de poche toute l’année; Rajiv m’a souri, je pense que je suis amoureuse; Durga  –  – , PhD!). And so did we. But the carefully constructed narratives, which Durga wrote in impeccable French and interspersed with exciting milestones, were not for us. Our domain is smells and associations, the quotidian and the transient. As we punctuate frantic mornings and lazy afternoons day after day, we modestly gather, in aromatic interstices between our leaves, the quiet intimacies of humans. We are no different from a beloved fruit from childhood, an old wooden toy, or the last song on a mixtape, lost and found again. We are easily forgotten. That is, until we remember.

As Durga inhaled the tea her mother had made her, its aroma bloomed into a remembrance as intense and engulfing as it was evanescent. A childhood memory, which had coalesced around the long-buried but instantly familiar fragrance of the tea, invaded her nostrils. Her body at once retracted and protracted into prepubescent angles, all knees and elbows. As the tea burned her throat, she was recalled into the body she used to inhabit, and the ways in which it had inhabited the world.

Bring water, loose leaf tea, five cardamom pods, and one crushed lemongrass root to boil in a small deksi. Add three teaspoons of milk powder, mix well, and remove from heat.

 

The kitchen is small and warm, the loud, flower-patterned curtains are open, and the tropical afternoon sunlight floods in through the window behind Mama. The smells of our old house in Riambel float around: fried fish, garlic and thyme, milk and cardamom, salt from the sea breeze. I do not yet know where one ends, and another starts. I will unfurl and catalogue them to make sense of the tangled threads of a lost archive, long after I have left my island.

I am back from school, ravenous. Usually, Mama makes pudinn vermisel for teatime. Today I smell gato franse. Like all the women in the neighbourhood, she borrows on credit throughout the month from boutikier sinwa, the grocer who keeps tabs in a large, tattered notebook: rice, oil, flour, and, when we start going to school, exercise books and pencils. Like most of the men, Papa drinks on credit from the local bar. At the beginning of every month, his pay is swallowed by the previous month. But occasionally, when there is still some money left, Mama buys gato franse like feuilleté custard, napolitaine, maspain – those local pastries with French names that are uniquely Mauritian and for which Muslim bakers on the island seem to have a special talent.

As she hands me tea and a napolitaine, I cannot quite see my mother for the light behind her, and I pray that she does not see the red shape imprinted on my cheek. Like all children at Permal Teeroovengadum Primary School, I know better than to tell my parents.

The teachers each have their own style, moulded by calculated sadism, dogmatic righteousness or blinding anger. They also have their own tools, hewn from dried bamboo culms, coconut fibre rods, or badamier stems. I sometimes imagine the Permal Teeroovengadum Primary School teachers taking a walk with their families on weekends and stopping in their tracks when they find just the right cane, as if waiting to be stripped of its leaves and polished.

When I am eight years old, in Standard 3, the lashes begin. I have been coddled enough the first two years of primary school, I am told. Monsieur Hassan’s cane, which he hides in a different place every time, appears out of nowhere and provides a swift lash for mistaking the French acute accent for the circumflex, or confusing Grande Rivière Sud-Est with Grande Rivière Nord-Ouest. No matter that we know the local names of our rivers, their depths and swells, like our own backyard. The cane disappears just as quickly as it appears. By the time the pain comes, the punishment has already ended, and relief taken over. Monsieur Hassan then makes a slightly clownish face, as if to mitigate our humiliation, or maybe his own discomfort towards what he believes he must do. He is the nicest out of the twelve schoolteachers.

Guru Manikam is not our teacher but often visits, unannounced, to chat with Monsieur Hassan. His enormous handlebar moustache twitches as his big red eyes scan the class. Once, they pause on Ahmad, who freezes. Guru Manikam beckons and Ahmad walks to the front of the class, eyes wide with silent terror. Guru hooks his index finger around Ahmad’s waistband, pulls it toward himself, and peers inside. He murmurs thoughtfully, as if deciding on which fish to pick at the market, or debating the merits of a particular rédaction. We collectively breathe a sigh of relief at not being Ahmad. Monsieur Hassan makes a clownish face and looks away.

The following year, Madame Ramsarai teaches Standard 4. She specializes in shaming rituals. When Preeti and Sarah-Anne, whom she forces to sit in the back and well away from everyone else, start chatting instead of following the lesson, she calls them to the front of the classroom. She pulls a chair close to her own desk, as if setting a stage. She sits Preeti in the chair, parts her hair gingerly with a pen, and shows Sarah-Anne the lice and nits. Sarah-Anne picks them between her index finger and thumb and quickly crushes them between her fingernails. They make a satisfying pop, and it makes Sarah-Anne smile. This goes on for a good half hour until it is her turn to sit and get her hair cleaned by Preeti. The rest of us look over to the spectacle from time to time, but mostly we carry on with our rédaction.

Madame knows that we do not quite fear her the same way we do her male colleagues, and she gets creative. Once, she tells us to wear our best uniforms, clean and ironed, for a dictée the following day. A dictée is a special occasion, after all, she says. And don’t forget to wear your best underwear, she adds, as we laugh. The next day, she calls to the front of the classroom all those who have omitted their silent t’s and d’s or have spelt –aux as –o. Their backs facing the rest of the class, the boys are asked to pull their pants down, and the girls to lift their skirts, before the obligatory lash on the buttocks for each mistake.

At the end of primary school, every child on the island competes in a national exam, and Monsieur Beekoo is our teacher for the last two years. His reputation precedes him. Out of the thousands who take the exam, his students regularly rank in the first five hundred, going on to join so-called star secondary schools. The rest go to regular schools, vocational schools, or no school at all. Monsieur has a panoply of punishments in his arsenal, and they flow out of frustration for the avoidable mistakes his favourites make – and indifferent disregard for the rest. When he asks me to conjugate the verb ‘instruire’ in the perfect tense, my tongue betrays me, skips over the pointed French u and flattens directly into the i so familiar in my native Creole. I feel the sting of the slap after he starts yelling, his face inches away from my own.

Like the teachers, the pupils each have their own style. Some jump and yelp, their eyes widening in surprise at every lash, their eyebrows disappearing into their hair. Others overdo the crying, hoping to soften the teacher’s heart, although we all know it never does. And then there are those who attempt to flee the lashes altogether, but with one arm in the teacher’s vice-like grip they only manage to dance in a revolving circle. I stand tall and silent, holding in my cries until my throat hurts more than the welts on my body.

I will soon leave for the Catholic secondary school Monsieur Beekoo and Mama wish for me. There will be no lashings there. It is, after all, a star school, one of the most respected. There we will mostly just suffer detention, either for wearing short skirts (Rule 7 from the Code of Conduct: the hem of the skirt needs to be at or below the knees and not reveal too much skin) or for speaking in Creole (Rule 2: only French allowed). Sometimes, when we fail to remember the main themes of Proust’s Du côté de chez Swann, a blackboard eraser is thrown in our general direction, easily dodged. And in my case, a teacher will replace my surname daily with funny ones from Voltaire’s Candide when doing roll call. I will stand tall and silent through it all, feeling no pain at all except for the strange one in my throat.

Presently Mama notices the red marks on my cheek, the ones left by Monsieur Beekoo. She promises not to tell Papa, but sits with me at night while I write lines: I conjugate ‘instruire’ in the present, perfect, and future tenses, and copy each ten times. I do not need my Bescherelle conjugation book. My written French is excellent, as Monsieur Beekoo himself tells me. When Mama gets up and starts to make tea for both of us, she tells me that I am lucky to be in school. She tells me that I need to focus and get an education, so I won’t be at my husband’s mercy one day. Or so I won’t end up even worse, like our neighbour: raising her daughters on her own, working night shifts in a tea factory where women are vulgar and curse in Creole – just like the men.

Bring water, tulsi leaves, and ginger slices to a boil. Remove from heat and strain. Add this water to your own waters, for the sake of your unborn child.

 

Water is primordial memory. My first memory, like my first water, is not my own, but Mama’s. It is of a time before I am born, stitched together from the bits and pieces my aunts share with me, weaved into my sense of self, the prologue to my story.

In this sepia-coloured memory, I imagine Mama to be very thin, not showing yet. The additional weight from carrying and birthing three daughters will come later. As will the calluses and cuts on her hands from cleaning and cooking: washing bed sheets and cloth diapers, grinding ginger, garlic, and masala with the small, rounded baby rock on the tall mama rock outside. When Papa yells, he says, bour to sime ale – get the fuck out. They have always rented, never owned, but he says, this is my house. When he yells, Mama thinks of her last day in school, the day before she turned fourteen. School was not free in pre-independence Mauritius, and her brothers were a better investment. She stayed at home to look after them, and to clean and to cook, wash clothes and grind spices. When Papa yells, to enn fam lakaz, you are a housewife, you do not work, she thinks of how she has had to work for men her whole life. But she does not say anything.

In my borrowed memory, she has one foot out the door of his rented house, as if about to leave. But she does not. Instead, she drinks the tulsi and ginger brew standing squarely in the doorway, putting all her hope in her unborn child.

I see all of this as if watching from outside that house in Riambel, hiding behind the hibiscus tree like a thief. The light in the house floods out of the doorway where Mama stands, and she is all chiaroscuro. I mostly see her movements in silhouette, but I imagine her standing tall and silent, and drinking in her tea.

When I am pregnant, Mama will make me a brew with tulsi leaves and ginger, and tell me that when she was pregnant, she used to stand in the doorway and drink the same concoction. Old women said that if she did this her son would be tall. You don’t have any sons, I will say back. And mama will laugh, as she often will after leaving the rented house and moving in with me. Me mo bann tifi edike, she will respond after a moment of reflection, giving in to my defiance. But my daughters are educated. And she will tell me that I am a professor of French because of her, that I am the tallest woman of the family because of her.

Pour hot water over tea sachet and let steep for five minutes. Add warm milk. Enjoy with a cucumber sandwich or scone.

 

I find a table at Quill and Ivy, the only tea room on campus. A few students around me are having tea and sandwiches, some of them working on their laptops or reading. Vandana, the only other Mauritian student I know at the university, works there part-time. She hands me a tea sachet in a handsome black-and-gold sleeve, next to a small creamer full of warm milk. The sleeve reads ‘Vanilla Comoros’. The vanilla bean, which gourmets associate with Bourbon (now Reunion Island) and Madagascar, looks dissonant in its pairing with the Comoros, these other islands of the Indian Ocean, even though it also grows there. I peer closer at the sachet, and presiding over the name, in smaller letters, I read: ‘Davenport and Sons Master Tea Blenders’. Even more intriguing and incongruous: the tropical, archipelagic tea is under the aegis of a staunchly New England name.

I am waiting for Nigel. I supplement my partial doctoral scholarship by tutoring high school and college kids. Nigel is neither. He is a musician who wants to speak French fluently, before his band tours the Caribbean with Martinican and Guadeloupean artists. While I ponder the disparate islands that conspire to bring us together – from Nigel’s touring locations to the implied provenances of my tea – he arrives. He waves, all smiles and ease. I find out that he is American despite his British name, and that he loves tea despite his country’s predilection for coffee. All these cultural nuances I have acquired in the five years I have lived here, at the same time shedding so many of my own. I have traded oiled-up tresses and dark skin turned ashy from skin-lightening creams for the sea-, sand- and sun-kissed images that dance in the eyes of most Americans when I tell them I am from an island.

I allow myself to flirt a little during those first months I tutor Nigel. He has a very easy, very white smile. The night he returns to Manhattan from Martinique he calls me, and I invite him to my apartment while my housemates are out. He smiles in the dim light of the bedroom, and I remember that his teeth are very straight, very white, somehow accentuated by his frayed sweater and faded jeans. He wears old clothes the way rich people do, a carefully curated aesthetics of poverty. I kiss his open smile then, taking it all in, the ways he has fucked and loved gorgeous men and women, the ways he owns spaces that push against mine, the not-quite-white of his Sicilian ancestors, laundered after Ellis Island, the unburden of his every day.

As he kisses me back, his greedy mouth searching for an opening, his hand slides down my stomach looking for the same, finding it quickly. I will his fingers in, revelling in the easy authority with which he moves in the world and in me. I turn my face and my aching throat to the wall, even as my sex pulls me toward his virtuoso fingers, all dexterity and controlled passion.

He stops then. His fingers, still inside, suddenly still. He puts his mouth to my ear and demands: I want to hear it. He has found my tongue, but does not find my voice. I stretch tall, silent, as I come in staccato, anticipating what his fingers are a proxy for. And desiring what his white teeth and blue eyes and accent are metonyms for.

When we have sex, my moans and postures are as deliberately arranged as my words. They come from years of watching Jason Priestley, Andie MacDowell, Shah Rukh Khan, and Rani Mukherjee speak love in English dubbed in French. The words I actually want to say never make it to my tongue, which has by now fossilized into pointed and squared morphologies. They escape me once in a while, but always outside of sexual intercourse. ‘Ayo,’ that protean sauce of an onomatopoeia that goes with every dish, comes first to express sheer pleasure, utter disappointment, and everything in between. Then ‘fouf’, more and more impatience. After a fight one day, something long forgotten almost escapes my lips: bour to sime ale. The painful knot in my throat alchemises the words and translates to Nigel: it’s over. He moves out of my apartment the same day. Although we break up on my terms, we say it in his words. That’s why it’s over.

I still go to the campus tea room. When Vandana sees me on my own, she comes over to chat and asks where Nigel is. I think of the long, intimate relationship language and sex have had in my bed, of the French we loved to flirt in and the Creole – Mauritian, Martinican or Guadeloupean – he never bothered to learn. But instead, I raise my voice and say, intending to shock: I don’t know how to say ‘Fuck me hard’ in Creole.

I expect Vandana to recoil or, at least, look away. Deadpan, she tells me how, and even adds her own spin on it. I recoil and look away. I have only ever heard these words used in violence toward women. They sting like a slap and their shape remains imprinted on my cheek for a while.

That night, the pleasure in my groin moves upward and explodes on my tongue, suddenly unsilenced, in words finally unviolenced.

Bour mwa for, ziska mo sousout bate.

I come as I breathe in the tea scent lodged in Vandana’s hair: Vanilla Comoros.

Vandana whose mother raised her on her own, working night shifts at a tea factory, cursing in Creole just like the men.

Vandana who is also her mother’s daughter.

Feast your eyes on the authentic vista of green tea bushes and local women picking tea while enjoying a tasting from the comfort of our colonial teahouse. Begin with our airy and refreshing vanilla tea, a favourite among customers, and end with the bold and complex Gold Label.

 

When I visit Dadi with Mama and Papa, I pretend not to like her, because Mama does not like her. Mama blames her mother-in-law for her husband’s temper. But Dadi knows how to win me over. She beckons to me with the hundred-rupee note she keeps hidden in the folds of her sari. She wraps my fist quickly around the note and urges me to hide it in my pocket, all the while whispering conspiratorially as if she is entrusting me with a treasure. She feeds me dal puri and tea with heaps of sugar. She swallows her own dal puri with a generous dose of arrack, but not before having poured a libation on the floor for Somoreeah. I laugh as she calls me Durga, rolling and trilling the r in her Mauritian Bhojpuri. I do not know Bhojpuri and she barely speaks Creole, but the way she says my name is another gift with which she tells me she loves me.

I like it most when Papa takes me, without Mama, to the plantation at the end of Dadi’s shift. Dadi puts me in the basket hanging on her back, on top of fresh tea leaves, so that I can see the large colonial house on the hill, beyond the rows of tea bushes on the Bois Chéri estate. There are people coming in and out of the house. Although they are the ones who look like ants, it is Papa who seems to become small next to me. I want to become small too, but on Dadi’s shoulders I am an extension of her strong, tall frame, and I cannot. The scent in her hair comforts me, as she silently picks tea to fulfil her quota.

Dadi started picking tea when she was nine. She picked tea twice as fast as her husband, earned more than him. And at home, she was twice as likely to lose her temper, especially after a few glasses of arrack. She would tell him bour to sime ale, get the fuck out of my house.

She stopped working on the tea plantation when she was seventy. But she did not lose the tea-picking basket, still weighing down her back despite its absence. When I visit from the US she walks toward me, bent almost at a right angle at the waist, the six-foot powerhouse that she once was now barely three feet tall, the height of a child. She unknots a corner of her sari and produces a hundred-rupee note for me, even while I protest that I am now a professor. She smiles, not understanding my words, my work, my world. But it does not matter when she hides the note in my hand and says my name.

The last time I visit Dadi before her death, she unknots a corner of her sari, but instead of the usual hundred-rupee note, she shoves into my hand a couple of pages, whispering in her usual way, gesturing for me to put them away.

A few days later, I stand in front of the pyre where Dadi lies as if sleeping. The eldest son or grandson traditionally lights the pyre, but Papa did not leave her any grandson, so I hold the torch. Later that day, I dig into my bag and find the papers she gave me. My aunt recognizes them. She tells me they are the only official document left of my paternal ancestors. They arrived in Mauritius from Bihar, replacing the enslaved on sugarcane plantations after the abolition of slavery. Dadi must have asked a distant relative who works in the National Archives to do her a favour. These are the only written testament of the couple from whom we are all descended. But the enormity of the situation does not correspond to the sparse two pages I hold in my hands. All columns and lists, they look like they were taken from our old grocer’s ledger. As I peer closer, instead of oil, rice, and flour bought on credit, I see the names of coolies borrowed on colonial contract. Next to each name, butchered by French orthography, cold details: registration number, provenance, age, height.

A painful knot forms in my throat when my eyes see before I can understand, ‘Height: 3 feet 2 inches’. When he arrives on the island in 1880, he is six years old. He has a first name only, the same that will become our surname, the same that my secondary school teacher will replace with funny ones during roll call. I look at the other page. She arrives a few years later, the same year tea is introduced in Mauritius. Her name is Somoreeah. She is five, and spends three weeks in a depot before being sent to the Bois Chéri plantation. The sparse documents bring more questions than answers. But they do tell me that she is three feet five inches. She is tall, taller even than him.

Some altars housed statues and images of goddesses, garlanded with flowers. Others held pungent incense and the photographs and personal belongings of dear departed ones. For Durga, we, her teas, held her dear ones, her goddesses.

When her daughter turned five, Durga took her to Mauritius, and to the plantation where Dadi had worked as a métayère, a sharecropper, in the last years of her life. Mama accompanied them but stayed in the car on the side of the road. Her daughter hanging on her shoulders, Durga waded into the waist-high leaves as Mama advised caution on land that they did not own, land she said had only been rented to Dadi. Voices from the colonial house drifted down toward them, muted, but they were quickly drowned out as the leaves tickled the feet of the five-year old and she laughed. Pointing to the tea leaves, she asked: ki ete sa? What is this?

Standing tall over the bushes, Durga breathed in the humid, pungent scent and replied, dite."

    "text": "We were at Fix Bar in the basement dancing to Busta and Ashanti when the message came through that my father was with the police. Romeo was drunk, so was his mother Tracy. Gillian and Romeo had been hugging and pledging their love for one another, ‘Family, we’re family, you’re like my son.’ They were in the house, the police. And father was much confused. And we should come, Gillian and I, yes even though it is two forty in the morning and I am having the time of my life.

My father is ninety-one. He insists on his castle with its empty rooms and baby ghosts. The kitchen bells still ring when he passes through its door. The wallpaper is curled in the familiar places and the garden is fallen. He knows these sunsets well, far out there beyond the dining room window, so much so that he no longer notices them. The whole sun of his life is setting. He is an expanse, a weather movement, an old symphony. Here is his waiting room of preference and who can argue with him? Those of us who have tried to persuade him that passing his last days in a sad communal residential is superior to perilous solipsistic luxury have given up.

So I left that party with my drunken sister Gillian and I am the one driving, being abstinent for my secret foetus. All the way between ‘the crisis is here’ and ‘I need another drink’ it was ‘Romeo the son I never had’ and ‘I need to see more of him’. Tracy is her best friend lately drifted. I used to follow them around when they were turning into women. When Gillian is drunk the seven-year age difference between us wanes and she is simple and unkempt. ‘Please don’t throw up,’ I say when her voice goes creamy and yawny coming off the roundabout, past the bungalow doctor’s surgery of our childhood, past the church we were harangued to enter by motherly shooing on Sundays to learn the tales of Christianity – we used to imagine that the stories were concocted by a bored shepherd dramatising his sheep. How she must be whirling in her grave, our mother, as we are passing by, these two unbelievers, still unbelievers, never yielding for a moment to her faith in paradise. Even now she haunts us. At dusk I hear her whispering, insulted, Where do you think I went?

The northern planes of London are chilly in the rains of April and the car has misted with our cooling body heat. We descend into the final hill and slide to a halt in the drizzle shining the leaves. All the way to the bottom of the street these trees, their branches angled in questions, the answers unfound. The house at first is a ripple. I wait. It always comes at me swimming, then solidifies, the smoke of yesterdays. The lights are on downstairs not upstairs. The porch has the remains of the religiosity of my mother in its stained glass, but beyond that she is gone. Jesus has left this place. The police are here instead, two of them, a woman and a man, standing in the hallway, while our father who art not in heaven is involved in a series of explanations about his panic alarm.

What a sight. His wiry head. His flapping forearms. His crumpled pyjamas. His apple-red mouth. When he sees us his face shows recognition without connection. ‘Ah, hello,’ he says, as if there were no calamity here, no cause for concern, no neighbours have been woken, no one has been interrupted, this is just an everyday middle-of-the-night and an ordinary visit from the crime-fighting public services. ‘Are you alright, Dad?’ Gillian says, a swell of emotion filling her voice. He looks so small, receding into the state of gnome, shrinking before our eyes. ‘Yes, I’m fine,’ he says, his brows raised, looking up and out from his realm of discombobulation with a quiet quivering. ‘You?’

 

First there was forgetting. What is that curved thing called that you use to eat cereals, soup and mousse? And what is the larger thing called that holds them? Information slowed on its journey from sight to brain to mouth. We filled in blanks. There was more and more forgetting, and much of it was invisible, because unless you are with someone all the time you have no way of knowing the new things they have forgotten. Even our mother did not know. Indeed she too forgot. They would wake into days to be remembered for their forgetting. What can you do about this when you are out of the neighbourhood? What are the limits of the grown-up child’s responsibility for the regressing parent? Can we do enough? Can we be enough, from the distance of our selves, and all that we entail?

Both surrounding and following the forgetting were its ramifications. The drawing in of speech. Because my father could not remember the name for spoon, it came to a point when he would not mention spoons, or all the other things he had forgotten that week or month. When he also started forgetting some of the smaller words used to join sentences together, then conversation itself became fatiguing. He had long stopped working by then. So had my mother – she’d taught primary school art and he had worked in taxation. Together they would take the bus to the precinct on Tuesdays and go to Somerfield to buy oranges, Battenberg cake and other things they liked. Gillian had organised mobile phones but they were of little help, they only increased anxiety. Once, I called my father during one such visit to Somerfield and he couldn’t find the phone, it had travelled into a secret alcove in his pocket. The act of speaking into it remained peculiar to him. As far as he was concerned, talking on the telephone should take place in a house, an office, a municipal building, or in a telephone box. Anywhere else was uncivilised and impolite. When he eventually found the phone, he struggled to identify the green button in order to answer it. By the time I received his voice he was a shambles. ‘What? What?’ he shouted. ‘Can you come and change the ringing thing soon, I don’t like it. I have to go to the carrots now!’ and he was gone.

Another time, again before the deeper throes of the forgetting, I took them to a gallery. The sun was on the June road, my father next to me, my mother in the back seat. She had dressed for the occasion in her gold dress, with her black purse, while my father wore his house trousers and carried a Tesco carrier bag. They had never been much the pair, it struck me, but their marriage had been long, and every marriage is a learnt marriage, its own language, its own system, defined only by the two, who they are and what they need and what they can tolerate and what they cannot. They had made something of love, my parents, and only they could have made it, and when they were no longer here it would no longer exist. The tragedy and the functionality of this moved me, as they patiently studied the painting of the dancehall queen in silver shoes seated before a Pre-Raphaelite backdrop, and the short film of the waltzers in the African ball gowns with masks on their faces.

‘That one’s right mysterious,’ my father said. My mother, a late-life Open University student, delving at that time into art criticism, said that she liked the juxtaposition of the diasporic imagery with traditional Eurocentricity.

Afterwards we ate pastries in the cafe by the river. My father fought with his Danish. He was trying to open it neatly but it wouldn’t cooperate.

‘Just tear it open, Dad,’ I exclaimed.

But when a man is in his twilight years and he wants to eat a Danish in his own way, I reflected, trailing towards guilt, you have to just let him. He has earned it. He has earned the right to expect what he expects from the experience of patisserie.

‘That does annoy me,’ he said, ‘how people speak these days. We used to say “expect” instead of “anticipate”. Now everyone says “anticipate”.’

My mother pulled him up on this. ‘Don’t be so backward, Willis.’ Sitting there in gold, watching the room that way she always watched, with a silent relish. Her mind was full of pictures. She painted with her eyes. I believe when she was dying she formed a conduit of colour to take her to her lord and she was ready, at the final moment, to enter light. I will never forget the way her face lost its age. Part of him she took with her. He drew the house around him like a cloak.

Christmases from then on were thin and oblique. We watched TV, missing her. There were random questions, randomly answered.

‘What’s a bling?’ my father said.

‘A bling,’ Gillian said, ‘is something that shines.’

 

The panic alarm is around his neck. He’s supposed to wear it all the time and press it when he falls, needs, severely wants, or glimpses death. This is the most he will allow of caring. Actually he enjoys the little button attached to survival, that he has the power to control his safety. Once a month on the fifteenth Gillian calls him to remind him to test it, which involves pressing it, waiting for the voice from the panic centre to ask if he’s okay, saying yes he’s alright thank you, and saying goodbye. This he also enjoys, in fact Gillian enjoys it too, a common project of memory, a duty. She has always been the one to organise and get things done while I am considered lazier, but it is not true. I aim for the galaxy. I bring stars and dancehall queens. She is of the earth, pragmatic.

‘Well I don’t know,’ my father says for the fourth time. He wriggles his trembling fingers. He is pacing the linoleum with a strange twitch in his waist. He goes from the hallway to the dining room to the kitchen. Whenever someone speaks to him he stares up at them as if they were the final gates opening. His eyes are bling in a moss of age, dazed, dizzy, dwindling, the last of a soul. April is coming wetly through the broken porch windows and the porch floor is soaked. ‘Why don’t you sit down, Dad,’ I say. ‘It’s late. Aren’t you tired?’

‘But what are the police here for?’

‘They just came to check.’

‘Check what?’

‘That you’re okay.’

‘But I didn’t press the button.’

‘We’ll be off now anyway,’ says the policewoman, the cycle of the conversation having been repeated enough times to confirm that they are no longer needed. ‘Sorry about your window. You’ll be alright now, with your dad?’

Gillian has been searching window replacement companies on her phone, suddenly sober. She has an impressive capacity to adopt a veneer of cold yet friendly professionalism at any time of the day and in any mood or physical state; she becomes robotic, and you only notice this if you know her well. She says to the crime-fighters that yes we will be fine now and sees them out. My father watches them go, a look of adoration and profound respect on his face. After a time he finally does sit down in his armchair in the living room, and while I long for slumber (dawn is not far; my silent child usurps) he and Gillian proceed into a full-blown conversation of a meandering nature, touching on disjointed things, comments on a coming storm called Alex, they talk about the washing machine and the limescale in its soap dispenser. She asks if he is hungry, whether he would like a sandwich, cheese, is there any cheese? There is a definition of cheese and a reminder of its taste. He opts instead for biscuits. I place three ginger nuts by his side, find some old newspapers to lay on the wet floor, and then I slip away to go upstairs. Someone in this building has to lie down.

There are three bedrooms. Gillian and I shared a bunk bed until I was tossed into the box room so that her womanhood could spread out. The queen-size that replaced the bunk is still there by the window, the apricot curtains withering above, the once shiny covers in fade. When Gillian and Tracy were smoking Marlboros behind the hot water tank in the garden I used to lie on her bed and sometimes she would come back and find me there, asleep, and I would be woken by the smell of tobacco. I would dream different dreams there, those of another, adaptations. A woman in a red coat would walk towards me out of the bushes, about to tell me something. Tonight, as if no time had passed, she comes again. I have drifted into sleep on the old bed. There is a flicker of my mother on Hampstead Heath with her hair beehive high and the shawl around her shoulders; and my father, like a monster from the deep, a younger man not yet changed. From her strange foliage the woman in her long red coat steps forward, an urgency in her face, fierce with revelation. It’s then that Gillian wakes me, throwing open the door.

‘What are you doing, Gayle?’ she says. ‘Why are you lying down?’

‘I was tired.’

‘I’m tired too. So we should both just go to sleep?’

Her shadow is large and hulking on the wall behind her, a hint of red in it. She swings round and storms back out of the room. I start to get up. She returns and comes close to me. When she speaks again, her voice is unmistakable in its similarity to my father when he was very angry – the hot brief terrifying edge, the power to diminish. ‘Get downstairs and help me deal with this.’ Our history is inside us. I slam the door after her and the dark feathers of the dark past fall.

 

Here is another random question: how do you love a monster when they are no longer monstrous? What do you do with their monstrousness, when it is posed for mercy, when it has turned in on itself? This question kept appearing and remained in my mind whenever I was with the version of my father who had moss for eyes and trembled and fell. He fell in the hall and he fell on the stairs. I would sit with him in the living room, which was slowly emptying, the boxes mounting around us, the utter confusion of his life as it faced its next corner, and I would try to match the two halves of him, the one who was kind and trusting and the one in which a collective of misgivings collided, his tensions and plummets and furious depressions. His weakness, in the end, overpowered his monstrosity.

While my foetus grew – five months, six – we went to visit some residential options. We perused the rooms, square yards and corridors of metropolitan late-life preservation. There was a red-brick nursing home in a former military block in Finchley with marks on the walls and an industrial site backing onto the grounds. A cosy new-age complex not far from the river in Hammersmith, close to Gillian, with outdoor walkways and uniform front doors; the common room had a piano and there was an activity timetable on the noticeboard listing arts and crafts, herb gardening, amateur carpentry and bowling. A tall, calm-inducing woman showed us her hexagonal room with its kitchen-diner and individual patio. My father peered around these possible new corners, imagining himself in this alien kitchen and that little garden, fresh and churning, so different from his familiar wilderness. His expression, through these tours, was of genuine interest bordering on indifference. It was no longer his choice. His children, foremost the eldest, now had the power to decide his future.

‘Are you going to move?’ Gillian asked me.

‘Where to?’

‘If he’s in Hammersmith you could move closer, so we can both be near him.’

‘I thought the whole point was that he’ll be looked after where he lives.’

‘And does that mean we never see him again?’

‘Sometimes you can be so unreasonable,’ I said.

‘Fair. Just fair.’

Something had changed that night after Fix Bar. Some unconditional ease had been dislodged. We were losing each other. Perhaps it was simply the years, our highways parting, the mounting weight of our father between us, but it pained me that Gillian didn’t call as much, even after I told her about the pregnancy. She didn’t send messages at dawn that I would immediately answer if I was awake. This was a loneliness, a new soul growing with no other blood listener, no one outside who knew enough. I told the baby’s father that I missed my sister and he said I’d get her back. How do you know I’ll get her back? I asked, because he was always telling me something would turn out well when he had no grounds on which to base the claim; he had a positive leaning, which I had come to rely on though also ridiculed, leaving me split and dislocated. ‘Because,’ he said, ‘you’re all she’s got. A time comes when you remember that.’

We visited a glossy residential ‘village’ with a large entrance lobby and personal intercoms, woods, a swimming pool, a hairdresser and designer dementia-proof kitchens, which cost two thousand pounds a week. Although I knew that this was beyond the capacity of my father’s wallet – he had saved during his working years for an eventuality like this – I initiated lengthy and foolish discussions with Gillian about its suitability. It was a way of feeling closer to her, bonding us through joint consideration and common urgency. ‘Mum would like it,’ I said. ‘Mum would like the other one better,’ she said. ‘He’d like the woods, though? Imagine him sitting by the window looking out,’ I said. She, ‘It’s too expensive. The Hammersmith one’s best.’

The room they gave him was two doors down from the tall calm-inducing woman. The old house was emptied completely, with Romeo’s help. He found a van, we brought down boxes of textbooks and the camping gear from the attic, gone were the linen trunk, the oboes, the reams of ancient tinsel, the paintings, the extendable dining table and the library of Britannicas and the easel and Mum’s coats which had stayed in her wardrobe hanging with remnants of her outings – a crumbling tissue, a folded piece of paper saying ‘glass cleaner, whisk’. The gold dress went to a charity shop for a six-pound sale. The easel went with my father and lived in a corner, unused, he had no paint, no brushes, but he kept it anyway. It invoked pictures from a history he hardly recognised but wholly contained. When he left the house for the last time in the wings of spring I heard it murmur for its flesh. It watched him go with hollow eyes. It loved its monster, the broken cage of him, walking slowly to the gate.

 

The child had come silver-eyed into the bright. His arms were thick, his skin was hot and papery, he seemed angry. Perhaps all the children looked angry now when they arrived, sensing a treachery in the air, or that too much would be expected of them and too little had been left. Seasons were asunder. There was nervous blossom on winter trees. I intended to tell my child that he was enough in himself, that the world, not him, was wrong. I used to believe that if we all lived as if the world were right it would eventually stand up steady, but on this the child’s father disagreed. It takes more than that, he said, and naivety is dangerous. Me though, I refuse to raise a soldier.

Gillian had taken to spending more time with Romeo. They went to concerts, took walks. I ran into him one day in town by Marble Arch. He carried within him – white Parka, white smile – an insistence on resilience, a learned defence. He was two years from twenty and the shadows might come but he would fend them off. He asked after my father and I said I was going to see him tomorrow. ‘Tell him I said hello. He probably won’t remember me.’ ‘Oh, he remembers everything, in hidden places,’ I said. We hugged goodbye and he walked on towards Park Lane.

The next day was a Sunday. It was the start of November, an autumn gloom lifting towards a Christmas that this year would be homeless. The house had been sold. No more would we gather by the plastic tree and entertain an older time. Those sunsets now were someone else’s. Another family had moved in, their murky insides visible from the street. Their secrets, their private sagas, were taking possession of the rooms. Gillian arrived in a red coat, like the woman from the dream, emerging from the sycamore trees, a cluster of them by the river along the walkway leading to our father’s room. The loneliness was still between us, a familiar estrangement. It occurred to me that I would never have her back the way it was; the child was a new distance. She lifted him and kissed him, balanced him for a while in his grandfather’s crumpled lap. He was talkative that day, a late clarity hovered, but with foreboding.

‘Now then,’ he said. ‘Will you make a picture for mother? She gave me the – brushes. There’s a thing of water.’

The baby looked glazed and gave a misty smile, not quite into the old man’s face but past it, into the recent universe. The easel in the corner had acquired faint, haphazard strokes.

‘Bright as all, you are,’ he said. ‘You look like angels.’

We were not sure who the angels were, but his eyes were darker, the moss thickened. He told us he was going to take his bike into the fields in the morning and find the house where she lived, it had a red front door. They would eat plum cake. The pears were not ripe yet.

‘Who’s that you’re talking about, Dad?’ Gillian said.

‘Well,’ he said, ‘it’s Anna. You remember Anna.’

And he told us, his last audience, about the woman in the house with the red door and her pear tree in the back where the sunsets fell. His memories now were one world, meshed and exploded. We were colliding with one another across his great pictures. He looked small and alien in this clean new space. You take a root from its ground and plant it somewhere else, it doesn’t grow, if too much time has already passed, if the essence has reached too deep. He did not know how to navigate this place, with its piano and its tall neighbour who knocked on his door asking if he wanted to come to church, or to harvest chives.

‘He’s going to die,’ I said, back out by the trees, the river behind us.

‘Yes,’ Gillian said.

‘Each time he knows us less. And one day when he’s gone we’ll be the only ones.’

‘We’ll be free.’

Dusk was gathering around, calling its blue birds, making the river shift. Gillian trembled inside her coat and held on to me. We were children at sea in the bodies of women. We were standing at the beginning again, where anything could be revealed and probed and admitted.

‘I always felt like I should be someone else,’ she said, ‘someone better. He made me feel like that. I thought I’d done something wrong.’

‘You didn’t do anything,’ I said.

‘Neither did you.’

 

I saw my father dance once. Only once. It was at Gillian’s wedding. There was a great tune, the kind of tune that makes the old and the young rise up. My mother was dancing. Her headwrap made shapes against the lights. She was joyous, unleashed. My father got up and inched forward towards the floor. He started moving, stiffly clapping. He couldn’t dance for hell. He had no concept of beat, no swing, no rhythm or sense of time. It was like a wooden thing moving after a lifetime of restraint. But it was the fact of this dancing that I will never forget, which captured, for all to see, a dimension of him, a presence we had never known, which had never made its way to us, had been held from us all the time, unwitnessed.

    "text": "I’ve always believed that the only constant in life is change. If we don’t embrace change, we fail to grow. Even worse, we put ourselves at risk. We lose the capacity to change when change is forced upon us. I resolved long ago I’d never again be afraid of change. And that is why I am here today.

That was my opening statement. It was what I believed then and it’s what I believe now. Perhaps even more so. I sat back down in the sharing circle to the sound of clicking fingers, a sound others might call snapping.

Thank you, said Hanno, our facilitator. That was so brave.

Yes, said the man beside me, so brave. He leaned over and whispered in my ear. Can I ask you something? Can I ask for your consent to touch you on the knee? I just want to express, physically, how much I admire what you said.

I said no, but politely. I don’t generally enjoy being touched by strangers, and while this was also something I wanted to change, I’ve learned to be kind to myself and not to push myself too hard in situations that make me uncomfortable.

When the final round of clicking and/or snapping died down, Hanno walked into the centre of the sharing circle.

With these incredible acts of vulnerability the first part of our opening ceremony has come to an end. Now, in order to embrace the community that has gathered here today, I am going to ask you to form what we call family groups. These will be groups of people who come together because they are arriving here with particularly important shared experiences. Your family group will be a space to which you can return for safe reflection, at any time, over the course of our journey together. So now, please stand up and begin to move through the room, connecting with those you see around you.

I am not a very sociable person. I have a small number of close friends who provide me with the emotional support I need. With them I am extremely affectionate and relaxed. They have often called me things like playful, silly, or boyish. I rarely work well in social situations with people I don’t know.

I stood up and looked around the room, a converted barn, the walls painted white. I counted maybe forty people drifting across the wooden floor, forming small groups and clusters.

Eventually Hanno approached me. Ben, he said, glancing at the name badge I was wearing, my role as facilitator is to enable you to get the most out of your time here. So I was wondering whether you might be open to forming a family group with some beautiful people I have just met: Omar and Kemal. I think you three might have a lot in common. 

These people seemed nice and I quickly agreed we could form a family group so I could return to my room for a rest. What I call my social battery gets very depleted by talking to strangers. The on-site accommodation was located in a renovated farmhouse close to the barn, a communal dorm with rows of bunk beds, but I had chosen to stay in my own room in a guest house a short walk up the road. I always like to sleep alone, in darkness and in silence. I like to have a space where I can go to recharge. The first day had come to an end and I wanted to be prepared for what I had decided lay ahead of me.

 

I’d recently witnessed a lot of change happening around me. I’d observed one of my best friends ruin a relationship because he became unable to communicate with his partner. He started lying about what he wanted, and ultimately ended up lying to himself. If we lie to ourselves, we risk forgetting who we are, and someone who doesn’t know who they are is a dangerous person. I never want to be a dangerous person.

Around the same time, my friend Sam was diagnosed with cancer. At the age of thirty-five. My other friend Anna had decided to freeze her eggs, only to discover that none of them were viable. In fact, according to her doctor, her chances of conceiving naturally, or even via IVF, are now negligible to impossible. Other changes were more positive. Kasia, a friend who has inspired and challenged me like no one before, finally qualified for permanent residency and can now stay in London for good. All this reminded me of what I already knew: life is constant change.

I know exactly what you need, Kasia said to me when I told her that I was ready for a new era. When I was living in Berlin, many of my gay friends would go to this festival, a weekend of talks, workshops, exercises. It would transform them, transform their entire lives. You have to do it. I can get you tickets, I know the organisers, I’m buying you the flights, it’s done!

It can be difficult to embrace change. But I believe the alternative is much worse. If we don’t accept change, we deceive ourselves by pretending that things can stay the same. And when we deceive ourselves, we also deceive other people. This leads to deception in relationships and friendships and if we are not careful, this deception can lead to abuse. To violence. People pretend to be something that they are not and when this lie is discovered, they lash out. I have observed so many abusive dynamics within relationships in my life. How many people are killed in relationships? A woman is killed by her partner or a member of her family every ten minutes. I understand this is due to patriarchal dominance rather than the inherent nature of human relationships. However, this is the world in which we have all been raised. I resolved years ago to break the cycle of abuse, and only enter into relationships where I felt that clear, verbal communication was possible in order to settle any conflicts that might arise.

If this meant that in the past I didn’t enter into romantic relationships because many, many people are incapable of clear, verbal communication – of simply replying to a text message, even when sent multiple times – this has never been a permanent decision on my part. I know there are other ways in which people communicate. I’ve read a lot of books, I’ve spent a lot of nights watching videos online, I’ve bookmarked a lot of pages on my internet browser. I know other forms of communication exist – touch, movement, even the hormones we secrete when we orgasm – it’s just that I’ve not yet been able to understand them. This might be because I only had a limited opportunity to learn other communication styles from my family, but after much reflection I concluded this isn’t likely to be the case. I have a very good memory and I cannot recall a time when I didn’t need clear, verbal communication. This is why, as a child, I never wanted a pet.

However, observing my friends navigate their recent difficulties did give me an idea. While I might not be able to change who I am, I might be able to change what I do. I might be able to understand other communication styles if I can translate them into the language I do understand: words. As someone who works as an audio engineer, translating sound waves in the air into electronic frequencies and back again, I realised this might be a technical problem I could solve, like dubbing a foreign film into English. I just needed the opportunity to actualise my will to change.

It is a festival, said Kasia, for anyone, how did she phrase it, for anyone in or attracted to the space of masculinity within a fluid gender spectrum. You go for a weekend and you stay in this farmhouse outside the city and you attend talks, workshops, healings. And you know, Ben, she said, I’ve always thought you would benefit from something like this. It’s going to be so good for you.

I believe that many gay men are sick. I believe that many gay men are deeply, deeply sick. This is because we are brought up in a society which is itself sick. The vast majority of gay men are raised in families where at least at first they are taught to be ashamed of who they are. I would call this a situation of emotional abuse. Many gay men have been taught to hate themselves. I don’t believe this ever really goes away. People may get to the point where they no longer consciously hate themselves, they may look in the mirror and think they love and accept what they see, but where does that hatred go? It is taken out on others in the form of toxic behaviour and emotional abuse.

When I lived for a number of years in Singapore, working for an English-language television station, the only friends I had were a group of gay men who would come to the country twice a year. Once in winter, once in summer. They would spend a month visiting cities in the Asia-Pacific region: Sydney, Honolulu, Hong Kong, Bangkok. It is a lie that you cannot be openly gay in Singapore. It is in fact completely legal. However, I experienced a strong division between those who had been born and raised in Singapore, and those who were expats, like me. These men would come to Singapore for a week at a time, they would stay in their hotels or hotel compounds, they would work out in the gym all day, and they would organise sex parties in their hotel rooms at night. No one would have sex with me, so I didn’t go. Perhaps it was because I was too small, perhaps it was because I was too brown, perhaps it was because I was too hairy. I have very hairy shoulders, so I rarely wear vests. Some men, I have seen this, they shave their shoulders every week. One night, when we had finished drinking vodka tonics at a hotel bar, one of them, Jamie, asked me if I wanted to come to their hotel room and take some drugs. I said no. That’s a shame, Jamie said. You have a great face, Ben; if only you worked out a bit more maybe you could be one of us.

Men like this, they are sick. They are damaged. They are everywhere, and they are dangerous. In any relationship, I need to feel safe. Men like this do not make me feel safe. They are why my most important relationships are my friendships. However, I’ve realised that in allowing men like this to hurt me, because I am not able to prevent observations like this from hurting me, I had unconsciously allowed myself to live in fear. And to living in fear, I say: no.

My flight arrived at the airport at six o’clock on Friday evening and I took a train to the village, which was located about an hour outside of Berlin. Most people were staying in the communal dorms, but there were also some men checking into my guest house. Or what they call in Germany a Pension. I like to plan situations in advance, to know what I am doing each day. On the train I had looked at the programme and selected the workshops I would attend. Since I’m not currently, and have never been, in a romantic relationship, I didn’t think I needed to practise intimacy’s choreography of gifts and requests. As someone who doesn’t have a family, I didn’t think it would be productive for me to go on a journey through my family constellation. I cannot ever see myself wanting to engage in plushie play. I also didn’t think I needed to learn how to dare to demand. I am someone who is already very confident about verbally expressing what I think. I always tell people the truth. This is why many people think I cause conflict, when in reality they just cannot handle the truth.

I am someone who is very picky about being touched. I hate, I absolutely hate being touched without my consent. Even when consent has been explicitly articulated on both sides I enjoy touching someone else – particularly their back and shoulders – much more than I enjoy being touched. If I have to, I prefer to penetrate other men rather than get penetrated myself. Just because I am someone who prioritises friendships over relationships, and who gets his main emotional needs fulfilled by those friendships, doesn’t mean that I don’t have sex. I have plenty of sex. Often, however, I find it unsatisfying.

Over the years I’ve experimented with many types of men, and I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m only attracted to conventionally attractive men who are tall. Taller than me. I understand I’ve been conditioned to feel this way but so far this is something I’ve not been able to change. Conventionally attractive men who are tall only want to have sex with conventionally attractive men who are also tall, or at least the same height, because someone cannot always be taller. If the tall always sought the taller, where would it end?

I am not conventionally attractive and I am not tall so when I message men looking for sex, or approach men in nightclubs, most of the time they reject me. When I’m not rejected, or when I’m accepted by someone who is tall but a little bit chubby, which is something I like, and who therefore will settle for someone who is short, like me, I enjoy sucking dick and rimming and licking men’s armpits as much as anyone else. I just don’t enjoy being penetrated. But many men underneath their conventionally attractive tall shells are just that: tall shells. They are empty inside. After sex they will rarely want to meet me again. Every time this happens, I ask them direct questions. I ask them: Why didn’t you reply to my message? Why don’t you want to see me again? What did I do that makes you not want to see me again? They rarely if ever reply.

This is something about myself that I wanted to change. I wanted to be attracted to different kinds of men. I wanted to embrace change. So I decided to sign up for the naked durational massage event, where apparently I would learn the pleasure of receiving as well as giving sensual touch. I showed up to a small room in the farmhouse wearing only a towel, as requested. There were maybe twenty men inside. The only windows were skylights in the slanting roof. There was incense burning and soft, chanted music playing from a Bluetooth speaker.

The instructor, Florian, reminded us that while this was a session intended to stretch the boundaries of what we would normally tolerate, if at any time we felt unsafe all we had to do was raise a hand in the air.

However, emphasised Florian, feeling unsafe is not the same as just feeling uncomfortable.

After dedicating a blessing to the space, we were told to drop our towels when we felt ready. I felt ready. I dropped my towel.

We were asked to begin moving around the room and when we felt the energy was right, to reach out and touch other people. For a while I stood in the corner of the room, waiting to feel the right energy inside me. Two black men were already stroking one another and a white man came up and touched their shoulders. I noticed that, even though he was tall and was smiling, no one was reaching out to touch the one visibly trans guy in the room. An older bald man reached out and touched my testicles but the energy didn’t feel right so I started to circulate around the room. I circulated again and again but then the older bald man appeared in front of me again and for some reason something about this room didn’t feel safe. I could see there were people in this room who also didn’t feel safe so I raised my hand and picked up my towel and left.

On the way back to my room, still wearing only my towel, I passed two members of my family group, Omar and Kemal.

I’m sorry about Hanno, said Omar.

Why? I asked, and both of them laughed, as if I were making a joke. They smiled at me and Omar put his hand around Kemal’s shoulders.

Your towel looks nice, said Kemal. We are just going to practise massages in our dorm, do you want to join us?

I explained directly and politely that I don’t enjoy massages and went back to my room. I remember feeling frustrated, and confused.

That afternoon, however, I had a very different kind of experience.

The workshop was called Sitting in Silence. This session, according to my brochure, would explore what happens when we connect through the simple act of looking. Participants were to gather in a room and stare into a stranger’s eyes for an hour, without speaking, paying attention to the thoughts and feelings that arise in this period of silent intimacy. When the hour came to an end, we were to return to our rooms, or one of the designated quiet spaces, and write down our thoughts as part of our reflective journaling practice, or simply to engage in whatever type of processing felt right in that moment.

The workshop, led by Hanno, took place in the converted barn with white walls, filled that afternoon with a soft, golden light. As I removed my shoes, placing them side by side against the wall, I observed that there were maybe thirty men in the room, everyone staring at the floor.

As we open this session, said Hanno, I encourage you to move through this space and attune yourself to the energy you sense around you. I will shortly ask you to stop moving, to close your eyes, and then to gently turn around on the spot. Then I will sound my gong, and the exercise will begin.

This time I was determined to follow the rules. I closed my eyes. I could sense other people around me. Due to my sensitivity about being touched, I have a strong sense of kinaesthetic awareness. I can feel when people are about to enter my personal space, and I could sense people turning around as I too turned around in the dark.

I heard the gong. I opened my eyes. I instantly made eye contact with someone who held my gaze in turn. His eyes were a deep brown, almost black. His skin was also brown, the colour of honey. He had a moustache, and short, curly black hair. He smiled at me before I smiled at him. He was exactly the same height as me. I remember feeling an impulse to look away. To look up, down, to the side. But I didn’t. I realise how strange this sounds, but already I felt I had committed to something that, if I saw it through, would change my life.

I walked towards him, carefully avoiding the other men who, in my peripheral vision, were drifting slowly across the room. I kept feeling an urge to look at his body, just for a few seconds. To double-check how tall he was, to be certain we were the same height. I could see that he was wearing a white vest and black denim shorts. He seemed to be lean, not muscular, but lean. I decided he was older than me, but only slightly. As we approached one another and sat down, without ever breaking eye contact, I realised that we were exactly the same height and that this would be a relationship between equals. A relationship where, right from the beginning, there could be no imbalance of power.

I sat down cross-legged on the floor and he sat down in front of me, barely an arm’s length away. I felt a rush of blood colour my neck. Then, suddenly, I started to get an erection. I panicked a little bit and the feeling of nerves only made me even more aroused. I could feel my erection pressing against my shorts but I couldn’t look down to see whether it was visible. I remember thinking: I have an average-sized dick. Sometimes men tell me, Wow, your dick is so huge, it’s so big, and I feel sorry for them. They need to imagine they are having sex with someone with a huge dick in order to feel turned on. That they are so hot that someone with a huge dick would fuck them. My average-sized dick was pressing against my shorts but I realised he had been staring into my eyes the whole time. He hadn’t been looking at my dick. That for some reason made me even more turned on and my dick even harder.

Even though I was staring into his eyes, I couldn’t help it: I was imagining what his dick looked like. His skin was brown. He could have been Spanish, Moroccan, Lebanese, from anywhere in the Mediterranean or Arab world. He looked generically Middle Eastern. I needed to know where he was from because it would tell me what his dick would look like, whether he was circumcised or not. I wondered what he thought my dick looked like. He probably thought I was circumcised, even though I wasn’t. This is a common misconception I have had to deal with. My mother was white, but I look fairly brown, which must have come from my father. This has always been a source of confusion to people, when they try to place me, as I assumed this person was doing now. I felt my erection shrivelling a little bit because suddenly I wondered what he was thinking about me.

My mother told me very little about my father, because, as she explained when I was eight, there is very little to tell. She met him when she was living in Sheffield, when he was working in a foundry for six months as an engineer. Making gun barrels. She got pregnant, and soon after he had to return home to Iraq. She wrote him a letter but never heard back. Then she moved to Coventry and had me, her one and only.

People assume that because I am brown, because I look like an Arab, that I must be a Muslim. Or, in the case of white gay men, that I am circumcised and going to be an aggressive, violent top. While, as I have said, if I do have to engage in penetrative sex, I would rather penetrate than be penetrated, I am a very gentle person. I don’t like being the object of someone else’s fantasy. This happens especially frequently when I date men while travelling in the whiter parts of Europe. Denmark, Norway, Sweden. Even France.

I noticed he was still smiling at me and that, as he smiled, the muscles around his eyes relaxed and his cheeks rose slightly. My erection was now very hard. His eyes were telling me he was happy, that he was comfortable. I decided there was a high probability he worked in some kind of creative but caring profession. A dance teacher. He had a dancer’s body. I decided he had come to this event to embrace change, and to expand his capacity for understanding people who have different communication styles than his own. People who are direct and always tell the truth.

Light from a candle was flickering in his pupils. I began to zone out and lose track of time to a certain extent. There are parts of this experience I cannot remember because there was no alteration to my field of perception for almost a whole hour, and I’ve read that our memories are anchored to changes in our spatial environment. If we spend extensive amounts of time in the same space, like our childhood bedrooms, all that time collapses into a single memory.

I realise in recounting this that what I am now going to say will sound absurd but I owe an explanation of my feelings to no one. No one else has the authority to decide whether what I feel is valid or not. Even though he had told me nothing, verbally, the fact that he hadn’t looked away for all this time meant he must have been open to the possibility of falling in love with me. I can’t tell you how I knew this, but I knew it. Love is a concept about which I have long been very sceptical. I have seen the damage that can be done, and can be justified, in the name of love. My mother, for example, must have been in love with my father, even just for one night, or otherwise she would have had an abortion.

Once I realised he was open to the possibility of falling in love with me, I felt open to the possibility of falling in love with him. I remember the moment specifically because I smiled with my eyes and then – I panicked. And not in the way that made me feel aroused. I panicked because I suddenly thought: I know nothing about him and yet here I am with the intense feeling that I’m falling in love. We have just been sitting here in silence. What if we were to enter into a romantic relationship – would he be capable of clear, verbal communication?

When I go out to gay clubs, I sometimes get approached by couples wanting to have a threesome with me. If I have taken a lot of drugs, I might say yes. But mostly, I say no. Because when I would have sex with these couples, they would completely ignore one another and give all their attention to me. Fuck me, let me suck you, and so on. I found this objectifying, and borderline abusive. Once I got over this feeling of being used, and most likely stereotyped, I realised there was something else going on. These couples: they were not communicating, not clearly and verbally. What couples ever do? Does anyone really know what the person they love thinks about them? Who would want to hear that truth?

So I decided to conduct an experiment. Rather than wait for couples to approach me, I started to approach them. I would go up to a couple and ask, Hey, I hope I am not intruding, do I have your consent to ask a question? Once consent had been granted I would ask: Would you be open to the possibility of a threesome with me? The results were revealing. Every time the couple had to look at one another before answering. Every time! Neither knew what the other was going to say. They didn’t know because they hadn’t been communicating. From this experiment I concluded that the vast, vast majority of men in relationships do not communicate openly about their desires.

I had been sitting down so long my foot began to cramp. Then I observed a confused look in his eyes. He had noticed something. My discomfort. My panic. What kind of person was he? Could he help me build a brighter future or was he crippled by the sickness of the world as it is? Before I told my mother I was gay, I took a deep breath and braced myself for change. Even though I had workshopped various scenarios, I had no idea what was coming. When she didn’t immediately respond I realised it was scenario three, so I told her I could move out the next day, I had saved up money, and I could work for a year before going to university. Which is what I did. I saw online that I now have a sister. But by the time I found this out, I had something better than a family of my own: my friends.

For in a friendship, unlike in a family, no one sticks with you out of some unspoken obligation. Likewise, in romantic relationships, people might not be attracted to you, as a unique individual, they might be driven by unspeakable needs, originating deep in their childhood, needs they could never explain to you because they can’t even explain them to themselves. Whereas in friendships, you are making a choice to get close to someone and they are making a choice to get close to you, a conscious choice that can always be discussed clearly and verbally. This is why friendships have been the only relationships in which I’ve felt safe, where I’ve been certain the other person is not lying to me.

The only relationships: up until this point. I was now really starting to panic. Was he deceiving me, right now, looking at my eyes but thinking, when will this be over, when can I just get up and leave? My legs tensed, and, yes, for a second I began to stand up. I felt the blood rush into my cramped feet, I thought about what Hanno would say, that I was breaking the rules, that I hadn’t stuck it out. And then I heard him begin to take a deep breath. Without once breaking eye contact, he slowly inhaled and sat up tall, stretching out his spine, pulling back his shoulders, and then he leaned forward and calmly continued to stare at me straight in the eyes. As he exhaled I felt my panic melt away. And then I knew. I was certain. He was different, unlike anyone I had ever met before. I just knew.

My panic had turned into reassurance. In fact, my panic had enabled reassurance. It had functioned like a test. I had momentarily wanted to run away, maybe in my mind I had run away, but when I had returned this person was still here. I felt the possibility of romantic love open up before me. He had somehow sensed my needs. I was able to smell him now, to distinguish his smell from that of the incense that was wafting through the room. He smelled like tobacco. He also smelled like coconut, and slightly sour, in a good way.

This is what I remember. I remember taking a deep breath and trying to assess the proportion of tobacco versus coconut in his scent. I remember hearing the gong. We stood up at the same time and I remember we were still looking into one another’s eyes. I understood that we had to leave and that I needed to begin the practice of reflective journaling that would lead to this revelation, the one I am able to share, in part, now. The relationship I had created had to come to an end, but I didn’t feel panic or anxiety. I smiled at him and he smiled at me. We turned around at the exact same time, and then I walked out the door and back to my room in the Pension.

 

The next day was the closing ceremony. I knew he would be there. I got to the room early so I could see everyone as they arrived. I saw Omar and Kemal stroll in and I had an impulse to smile at them. To non-verbally express some empathy and, yes, a sense of solidarity. But when I tried to catch their eyes they ignored me and sat down beside a group of tall white men. I flushed with blood and wanted to walk over and ask them, directly, why they had ignored me, but then Hanno asked us to sit down in a circle.

Or what I call, said Hanno, an inverse circle. I want us to be in proximity but also to be able to give each other the freedom to say things that others might at first find difficult to hear. So as you arrive, I ask you to sit down on the floor, cross-legged in a seating pose, or in whatever kind of seated position that feels comfortable in this present moment, and to form a circle facing outwards. Become aware of what this arrangement makes you feel. What is coming up for you right now?

Hanno non-coercively directed me to sit down and face the wall and because I was early I was one of the first to form the circle.
I heard more people arriving. I couldn’t see them but I knew there was no reason to panic. He would hear me.

Hanno invited us to begin the sharing. Normally I would have felt the need to verbalise my feelings right away but already I was learning: this is not something I always have to do.

I have something I would like to say, someone said. I would just like to express my gratitude to you all for coming here. We have all been so brave and I feel honoured to have experienced such intimacy with you all.

I would like to say something, said someone else. This is not an attack on anyone in particular, but I did feel that our discussions at times lacked a more materialist analysis of the oppression that we face but are also complicit in inflicting.

I saw Hanno glide past me while everyone sat in silence.

I have something complex to say, said another voice, and I am not sure how to say it, but I have never doubted anyone’s good faith this weekend so I will just try my best. I would never want to police anyone else’s desires, and I also understand that no one is entitled to be desired by anyone else. But I will say, especially in the durational massage event, I was made very aware that I was not attractive to anyone here. And I suppose I want to say nothing more than this made me feel sad.

It was finally my moment.

I have something to share, I said. I came to this weekend with the intention to embrace change. To push my boundaries. To maybe dissolve them, in a safe way. I believe that only if we are open to change are we able to survive. To thrive. I am someone who is very skilled at clear, verbal communication. In turn, I need clear, verbal communication from other people because if this isn’t available, there is a threat of misunderstanding. Misunderstanding which can lead to conflict, conflict which can lead to abuse. To violence. I have always known there are other communication styles, but I have never been able to understand them. This has caused me deep anxiety and frustration. But this weekend I realised I no longer have to be anxious, or to punish myself, because I discovered that I can translate other modes of communication into my preferred form. I can observe non-verbal cues like looks, blushes, postures, and so on, and silently, to myself, I can translate them into a verbal equivalent. I can then check in with other people and ask them questions. What do you mean? Is this what you mean? By doing this I can create a feedback loop of non-verbal and verbal communication and this can expand and transform my ability to understand and connect with people.

The circle remained silent, but this didn’t upset me.

Thank you, said Hanno, that was very passionately said.

Wait, I said, there’s more. I have learned that love needs silence, but silence is not deception. What I’ve also realised is that the silence that enables love – this is more powerful than the ideology of romance, which is only one kind of love. I believe we don’t know even a fraction of what love could be if we brought a comparable level of sensitivity and awareness to non-verbal communication within friendships. I feel like I have this new power and while I may use it to open the door for romance, I am certain I can use it to help my friends. This is my mission.

When we had completed our blessing I stood up and turned around. I couldn’t see him. He wasn’t there. It didn’t matter. This is what this person had come into my life to do. To give me this revelation. Sometimes, what I learn from observing people overwhelms me. I have to be very, very careful about revealing what I now know to other people, in case they use it against me. I cannot reveal everything I have learned, the danger would be too great. Just because I have changed, this doesn’t mean the world has changed. The world is still sick. The world is still full of danger. But I’ve changed. I have completely changed."

    "text": "It was dark by the time I reached Bonn. I was about to meet, thirty years later, Selma, who had been my best friend when I was young. Our friendship had unravelled as friendships often do, for no particular reason, because our paths had diverged. I had started to write, Selma had fallen in love with a German musician, and although our tastes and interests had been, if not shared, at least very similar between the ages of seventeen and twenty-two, she had turned more and more towards her own interests, which were music, mysticism and philosophy, while I had turned more and more towards mine, which was literature. The parting, however, had been a bit brusque, and it was Selma who had initiated it. We met in a cafe in Paris where she told me she had decided to end our friendship and go her own way. I then forgot about her, I think, as no doubt she forgot about me, though I discovered later, when I met up with her again, that she had felt bad about ending our friendship in this rather brutal manner and feared I might have been badly hurt.

I remembered Selma as a girl who, when she turned up for vacation at my grandparents’ one day, had stepped down from the train with an enormous bunch of wildflowers. I also remembered the pleasure she took in tormenting a shy young man who was in love with her, playing at kissing him whenever possible only to give him nothing in the end. On another occasion, when she was the one in love, she had declared her passion for a man she yearned for but didn’t know how to approach by stuffing his mailbox with rose petals. I remembered that she read Nietzsche avidly, that her father was a minister, and that she had an absolutism that made my own demands seemed lukewarm. Last but not least, I remembered an abundant correspondence the moment we were apart, and endless conversations the moment we were together. Something slightly odd united us at times: a form of cruelty.

One day, scrolling through Google for traces of this or that friend from the past, I typed her name on the keyboard and discovered that she lived in Bonn, where she sold icons. There was an email address, I wrote to it, cautiously, asking if she was indeed the Selma I had known, though as her surname was very unusual, I was almost certain it was her. She replied at once, and a frantic exchange of long emails ensued, giving news of our lives, clearing up misunderstandings, sharing bereavements (in my case), births (in hers), affairs of the heart, jobs. And we decided to meet. It was I who would take the first step and go to Bonn, since it was I who had wanted to find her.

When I stepped down from the train, Selma was waiting for me on the platform with an enormous bouquet, not of wildflowers this time, but of roses. What struck me at once was that she hadn’t changed at all. Thirty years of life, of new experiences, joys and sorrows, friendships and loves, travels and work, and, in Selma’s case, motherhood, had left her so identical to the young woman I had known that I felt almost uncomfortable. She wanted to whisk me off to a beach on the shores of the Rhine where she liked to sit and watch the river. I thought it very sweet of her to want to involve me like this, right away, in something she enjoyed doing, but I was worn-out from the journey and from the emotions aroused by the idea of a reunion, it was dark out, I would have preferred her to take me to her apartment where I would have rested for a while before dinner. I told myself that I had clearly aged, with this need to pace myself and rest, whereas Selma, like the woman she had been, the women we had both been thirty years earlier, cared nothing for rest or quiet. She had remained every bit as ardent, lively, inventive and freewheeling as before. I admired her for this, realizing (though I had known it for years) that I no longer felt any pleasure in improvising, sitting on a beach at night when it’s a bit chilly, drinking beer straight from the bottle, chatting with a friend under the stars.

Not only had Selma not changed physically, with her scarlet lipstick, her leather trench coat and her blonde hair, but her attitude to life hadn’t changed either, her words, her conversation, her laughter. And yet she had a twenty-five-year-old daughter whom she had raised alone, and she’d had a rather hard life which she told me a bit about, as well as certain satisfactions I found difficult to place. When she showed me into her home I was at once amazed, intrigued and bewildered. The apartment, where she lived by herself, was gigantic, occupying two floors with a huge terrace, was full of interesting furniture and objects, some of which came from her family (I recognized a sleigh bed I had seen at her parents’ home) while others she had probably bought for herself (I recognized her unfailing good taste), was packed with bookcases and books, vases filled with fresh or wilting roses . . . and was an unspeakable mess. On a table, on a beautiful tablecloth spattered with stains, unwashed plates and overturned wineglasses conjured up the aftermath of a drunken party, except that the glasses, plates and tablecloth seemed to have been there not for twelve or twenty-four hours, but for weeks. In her kitchen, a mound of dishes, saucepans, glasses, plates and cutlery spilled out over the sink and neigbouring surfaces, like in a fairy tale where time has come to a halt and turned everything to stone, leaving everything ‘exactly as it is’ in a magical sleep. Selma seemed oblivious to the mess and offered not a word of explanation. I realized that this was her world, that she had been inhabiting this world for a long time now and couldn’t see how odd it appeared to a visitor, and that she probably welcomed very few visitors into her home.

Other than this, there was nothing to suggest a woman who had lost her way. She dealt with some business on the phone, switching fluently between German and English, showed me pictures of her daughter, who was studying abroad, pulled down books we had read together when young and took me out to dinner at a restaurant she liked. What struck me when we were back in the apartment was the hoard of possessions she seemed to live among, a side of her I had never seen before: ten coats hung on her coat rack, on one of the large tables in the living room were bundles of folders and documents, her terrace was overflowing with plants, and her bathroom, which I visited briefly before turning in for the night in a bedroom of my choice (there were four available), must have contained a good fifty flasks, jars, shampoos, creams, oils, soaps. Selma lives as if there were eight or ten of her, I said to myself. And though the hoard of possessions and the chaos to be found nearly everywhere seemed extraordinary to me, I still wanted to see in them a fearless display of freedom, of disregard for practical affairs, of youthfulness, mentally comparing her life  to my own, which had become so strictly regulated, so orderly and so full of little habits, that it made my friends laugh.

There was also the question of a man. A wealthy, powerful man whom Selma was toying with, exactly as she had toyed with the timid young man until he was madly in love with her and then instantly cast him aside. The persistence of this over the years struck me as odd. Had Selma never felt the need for love and affection, like me, like the rest of the world? Was she trapped in this sadistic wheel, or did she remain there because it was the only position that gave her pleasure? What had grown in her, it seemed to me, was not what I had most liked about her in the past. She also had this way of disavowing, of erasing the thirty years that had elapsed by dredging up conversations that no longer held any real meaning for me, discussions and questions which, for my part, I had found an answer to one way or another over the years, and I didn’t like the confusion this sowed in my mind. Little by little, I could feel myself growing apart from her again. I was there for three days, but by the second day I was itching to leave. I still admired the independence of mind that had always distinguished her, her way of thinking solely for herself which I had loved more than anything and which had made us such close friends, the peals of laughter with which she would greet any form of stupidity, vulgarity, falsehood. Yet the gap which had started to appear, as if between the two legs of a pair of compasses, when we were twenty-two had grown significantly in my eyes, and now stood so wide open that, apart from our momentous meeting at seventeen, we had virtually nothing in common.

After my return to Paris, she wanted to continue our discussions, but I didn’t, and I told her so, explaining why. As gently as I could, I closed the door. She never tried to open it again. Later, I wondered whether her decision to end our friendship when we were twenty-two hadn’t affected me more than I realized, and whether the reason I went back to see her, thirty years later, was so I could end it in my turn."

    "text": "The sad thing? His parents, in their own way, had encouraged his talent. His father had typed and printed out his limericks when he was young, stowing these relics away in a Godrej to bring out for guests to ‘ooh’ and ‘aah’ over. Years later, his economist mother had taken Chetan along on a work trip to the US and arranged a meeting with a shambolic English professor in Chicago. Chetan had applied to that college for his undergraduate degree and been admitted.

His parents had not wished for their son to pursue art as a career, but they had lit his path.

He had betrayed them.

Now, thanks to what Chetan had published, he and his parents were in trouble, and he was exiled from India. The exile was only mental: realistically, Chetan could take a plane home anytime. This was the difference between a previous generation’s experience abroad and his. In the 1980s – that period when his parents had briefly lived in Texas – you could be in love with your home country, besotted with your grandparents, nieces, and nephews – writing them letters every week – but you could only speak to them on the phone a couple of times a year. A trip, if it came, was momentous, an event long saved-for, built-toward. Whereas now, you could hate everyone at home, quarrel with them over email, be alienated and disowned, and still return three times a year.

A month after the fallout from his book, Chetan found himself on a flight to Mumbai. He was frightened.

At the airport, his parents received him with grave hugs, and later he lunched with them at a plastic table in their bedroom, so placed that you could watch cricket on the rackety TV as you ate. ‘So what?’ his father was asking, between tocks of a two-dimensional cricket ball. ‘What’s happened has happened. You must come and promote your book. Have you contacted your publisher here about an event?’

Chetan said he would do it.

‘Beta, don’t just keep looking into it,’ his father said.

His generous father! Chetan watched the graying man fork salad – cucumbers and carrots – onto his plate. His father was on a diet, as always, but it would be undone, Chetan knew, in the afternoon when he became ravenous and consumed biscuits and fistfuls of salted almonds, and then started casually insisting that the maid mix bhelpuri ‘for his son’.

Chetan’s mother was more circumspect. She asked Chetan about his flight, dragging a small comet of daal in a clockwise circle on her plate.

Chetan, half asleep from jetlag, foggily glanced out the barred window. Nothing had changed in this mildewed Bombay Deco tower full of his relatives. The driveway was still a long bat of stale, dried-up Cadbury’s from which great bites had been taken out. The tree outside the bedroom window spat its leaves in all directions, so you could barely glimpse the tinselly cars crammed underneath. The jaalid white wall along the driveway – the wall that he and his sister had delighted in kicking in as kids, watching the delicate fretwork crumble – had, like all the other common areas, never been repaired.

And over the next few days, meeting relatives, it was possible to feel that nothing had changed in the family either.

‘You write in such high English, beta, I could barely understand it,’ one of his chachis said, when he went to see her in her drawing room, a space she constantly reconfigured as an expression of her larger dissatisfactions. ‘But Chacha and I are very proud.’

An older cousin he met said she wanted Chetan to sign her book.

This was not the shouting or abuse he had expected. The explosions had happened in his absence – to his parents.

And, one night, when his mother sat with him on his bed – her appearance in his room always a harbinger of bad news – he learned that things had been worse than she’d let on over the phone.

At a family wedding, she said, she and Chetan’s father had been cornered by various relatives who had accused them of writing the book. ‘How could someone that young know such good English. Someone must have taught him, right?’ Nishant, a black sheep of the family, had marched up to Chetan’s mother, chicken bones falling off his plate, and declared that Chetan needed to publish an apology.

‘To whom?’ Chetan’s mother asked, playing dumb.

‘Didi, a columnist has said in a national paper that Chetan is writing about our family. That all these insulting characters are from our clan. So Didi, if, as you say, Chetan has not inputted any spurious material in the book, he must pen an open letter posthaste demanding an apology from the columnist.’

‘So the columnist should write the apology?’ his mother asked.

Chetan’s hand was inches from his mother’s on the bed, but he did not move it. He was thinking: how painful it must have been for her to be told that she hadn’t raised her son correctly . . .

But you did raise me the right way, Chetan wanted to say, that’s why I speak the truth.

Instead, his mother’s tears, her abject look, hardened something in him and he said, ‘You’re being too dramatic, Mama. They’re bad people. I had no choice but to write about them.’

But was that true? What he had written was fiction; and what had emerged in the book was a self-portrait refracted through the images of childhood. Now he had learned that these images didn’t belong solely to him. His sin was that of trespassing, of moving from a mixed socialist economy to a capitalist one. Of becoming a drone who zapped the natives.

He made a clucking irritable sound and went on, ‘Who cares what they think?’ Soon, he was delivering a lecture on bourgeois values.

His mother listened meekly as unripe pods of mulberry dropped from the tree outside.

 

Chetan returned to America early, eager to set the record straight with his family, with the world. But, upon landing and going to his office – he worked as an editor for a think tank periodical – the fight went out of him. What could he do from here? What was his future now? On the flight to New York he had tried making notes, even attempted an apology, but his hand had cramped and buzzed with static; and when he had risen to go to the bathroom, another Indian man, holding up his pinky as an explanation, had jumped him in the queue. Chetan had been too dazed to respond.

Later that week, at a restaurant, his girlfriend began coughing up blood. Chetan stood up quickly, shouting for the waiter: ‘Could you please bring a hanky? A hanky!’

He had meant a napkin, which is what the waiter brought. But then everything in his mind was jostled, in transit.

‘It’s just beets,’ his girlfriend said, eyeing him wearily with her heterochromic eyes – eyes that had once beguiled him, but which he now found disquieting. ‘I’m so happy you didn’t spend that extra week there,’ she said, wiping her mouth.

‘You were right about that,’ he said, meaninglessly. But the muscles in his neck were burning. He had carried the tension from that continent to this one.

The transfer of rage from one place to another: was that his real job?

The export-import of emotions?

A few days later, he called in sick at his day-job, showered, put on his only suit, and took the subway to a broad midtown building.

The façade of the building was marked by violent downward concrete striations. Inside, a woman behind a granite reception table asked him for the floor number and photographed him for a badge.

Chetan flew upwards in an elevator and pressed the button before it reached the top floor.

Following green carpeting through canyons of white cubicles, he came to a glass conference room, where a woman and a man, his editor and agent, were waiting for him.

A sheaf of paper lay on the table, labeled Untitled Sequel.

‘So, you’re still feeling good about delivering in twelve months?’ his editor asked.

‘Yes,’ Chetan said, his accent suddenly unplaceable. ‘Very much so.’"

    "text": "First, a boy was meant to stop following him mama, then him papa, then at around fourteen him become him own man – that’s how Ras Levi say life was suppose to work.

Anyway, because of him condition, Denton was always moving and fidgeting, always doing everything inna rush, so I figure it wasn’t important, but by time I open up, Denton could hardly speak for catching him breath. Him rest him hand pon him knee, and the eczema overneath him eye did favour one crease bag, and him locs almost brush the floor. Eventually, him manage fi tell we that the pigs them were in the Gardens arresting Angela and that the community was trying to stop them. It was bedlam.

Immediately, Sister Dorothy dial the upstairs line.

‘Why yuh never come and tell we sooner?’ I say. ‘What yuh a deal with, bredda?’

Denton gave I one nasty look while him scratch him arm.  ‘I got here as fast as I could, man.’ Which was true enough:  him finish third on sports day. I ax him what the pigs accuse  Angela of, but him wouldn’t say. Him want fi wait fi Ras Joseph first, which I thought was pathetic. I ax him again, but true to him word him remain hush hush till Ras Levi and Ras Joseph Tafari appear from the fourth floor, and then Denton couldn’t stop blasted talking. Him tell all of we how Angela had been arrest in possession of explosive and plan for the bank down a the bottom of City Road. The riot police raid her yard and now them from the Mother have them pen inna the playground.

‘Babylon plant the things them on her or she really mean fi mash up the bank?’ Ras Joseph Tafari ax, and Denton confess that him never know. I glance at Ras Levi to garner his reaction, ready to dismiss Angela as irresponsible, or cowardly, or whatever language him would use, but really in I whole life I’d never heard nothing so spectacular. ‘What yuh think, Levi?’  say Ras Joseph Tafari.

I papa stroke him goatee. Him face straight. ‘If Joyce seriously mean fi damage the bank then that woman even more concern with fruitless victory than I already know her fi be.’  Him turn to his second-in-command. ‘It might be a trap fi get I&I outta the centre and inna the Garden so that them can lock I&I up without the trouble of blasting through I&I door.’ Him point at two of the older boys. ‘Unuh stay here and make sure nobody don’t come in when we gone.’ Him march from the door and the rest of we follow after him: Ras Joseph Tafari, Denton, Sister Dorothy and I, everybody in the centre except those two older boy, we tip and pour onto City Road, twenty-tree of we in total, all in our outerwear, all head toward the Garden.

I mostly knew Angela by reputation: I knew that she never belong to the centre, even when the area was one; that bald-head gossip did whisper ill-proven rumour bout her friendship with Joyce; that she help establish the Mother as a hub; I’d heard that, of the two woman, she was the more prone to violence – which now seem f i be true; and her inability to  hold liquor was well-known, mostly because the volume of her drunkenness had woken many a resident, many a time.  I knew that she was a product of the children home pon City Road and had tree fully gold teeth; and I’d heard that she once work there at the supermarket down a Broadmead but was sack for her temperament.

The bank Angela allegedly want gone stand alone at the beginning of City Road, near the corner where Frontline con- verge on Lower Ashley: another of the area lightbulb-less main road. It had a car dealership and a corner store on either side, but it remain detach – too full of itself to associate with any neighbour. Dust spiral inna the lobby. Its desk older than the area. It was red-brick where the other building in St Pauls were white or grey. Its clerks English, its manager and money too: I don’t know a single person in St Pauls who keep them money inside; only strangers rush through the doors and pass its watchmen in the foyer. Coppers patrol nearby, them detail double after dark and them German shepherds were without muzzle, and mercurial. At teatime, the few West Indian who ever attempt fi get a loan share story and spin them embarrassment into anecdote to laugh about over Ovaltine and milk biscuit.

We never pass the bank on City Road. Instead, we went down Campbell Street and across Frontline – where the sun always felt warmer. And Denton say, ‘Baba, somebody say them see the copper bring fertiliser and oil from Angela yard, the kind yuh use fi make an IED.’ I roll I eye. The only reason either of we knew what an IED was, was because every Rasta in St Pauls follow the IRA report. ‘Proper,’ is what Ras Levi would say whenever the newsman mention them on the radio. ‘It’s not our fight but them proper still,’ him would go on.

‘Them nah stand a chance of winning, Jabari, but still them a fight the fight. Them nah have a hope, because them a fight people who favour them, overs? Yuh can’t tell a English from a Irish till him talk, and an English spy can master an Irish accent, but them can’t step inside no black skin, iyah.’’

We arrive at the edge of the Gardens with Ras Levi still leading the way. The name sound fancy, but really, them were a pebble-dash maze. Nuff low-rise maisonette where the poorest people in St Pauls live. The twisting pathways were crack and without signpost. The walls were top with green-bokkle glass, and if you hadn’t grown up playing there you wouldn’t be able to orient yourself at all. That’s why the rudeboys and the sticksmen hang out there: so them could snatch chain and wallet, and be lost. Even if you live in St Pauls sometimes you did affi be careful in the Gardens, but that was dependent on who you were, I suppose: I was cool with the rudeboys and the sticksmen because them mother often come inna the centre fi food, so them did carry a certain level of respect fi Ras Levi.

The rudeboys and sticksmen, with them suit trouser and trilby, were the first people we did come across as we pass overneath the steel archway that separate Frontline from the housing estate. Them were perch pon people wall, either side of the walkway, smoking the ganja we sell them. A couple of them had the local newspaper hanging from them back pocket. Others had them wide-eye baby pon them lap as accessory. I could hear raise voice and curse word coming from the estate behind them. I thought them might’ve been in the miggle of things, but then I member say most of them were on the run for minor offence, and the rest never need any more problem with the beastman than them already have.

Them hail we as we arrive and point we toward the play- ground. We continue through the twisting, oxbow passages, passing Angela empty maisonette. Her front door was lame and open. It wood twist. The pigs had smash the panel glass. With each step the faraway voices grew louder. I could soon make out the anger of the people separate from that of the police. We turn a corner into the central square where we found a mass of people between we and the playground. Most part when them see we coming, but wherever we travel in any number our reception was mix. It was a sight to see: Iyaman in colourful dress and long hair, walking with our head held to the sky. No one was prouder or more righteous than I&I, but it was no secret that some of our fellow African try diss we; even in Jamaica there were people who would see harm come to RastafarI, all because them was desperate to be involve in the presiding colonial society, and we weren’t. The sell-outs see we as troublemaker, rabble-rouser, but we only made trouble where trouble was require: RastafarI never compromise.

Those in the Gardens who recognise the power in our unity pat Ras Levi back and praise Christ Jesus, likkle boys and girls gambol after I&I, and from them porch mamas wave them dishcloth and rag, each with one hand in the air, the other on them hip. I spot Miss Francis, standing impassion pon the roof of an abandon Allegro. The family car had been left fi so long that it was half sunk into the yellow grass, providing regular driving lesson for the local yutes. Miss Francis was a respectable woman, Ras Levi said so, cept for when she drop leaflet through the people them door, calling for a boycott of the ballot. She was too involve in English politics for RastafarI liking, because when one break the word down, politics becomes poly ticks, and you’ll find that poly mean many, and tick is a parasite. There is no freedom or song to be found in politics, only disease.

Rumour have it that Miss Francis was once a member of the Labour Party, and that she was ax fi leave fi reason unknown. Her green headwrap was tall and her Christian skirt brush the car roof as she deliver a sermon in her rough, small-island tongue: ‘All day long the whole of we complain to the pigs bout the pigs, to the council bout the council, and to the prime minister bout him own cabinet, but we must shape our own destiny!’

As we drew closer to the playground fence, the crowd became more hostile and we saw a number of feminist from the Mother Earth, but them was too preoccupy with the pigs to pay we any mind. I never see Joyce.

‘The skinhead nah go nowhere, boy,’ Miss Francis continue. ‘Take a look, them all round us in them police uniform.’ We barge our way to the front, and it was there we first see the coppers, dress in full gear, catch between the swing and the seesaw. ‘Whether it’s Labour or Conservative, them hold a sham, two-party election every five year, but capitalism is the true ruler of this here country. The pigs aren’t nothing but a group of white man employ fi carry out terrorism against the working class, and it’s our people who suffer first and most!’  The people who listen did shout in response, and at the same time I catch sight of Angela in the playground. The copper had her pon her knee, holding her collar like them hold them dog. Her head had fallen limp pon her clavicle. Her eye and  cheek bruise. I voice rose with the rest of the people and we cuss Babylon for all eternity. The uproar sweep I&I along in the rawness of it emotion, and I surrender I-self to the upset."

    "text": "The purpose of the group chat was to talk shit about Eloise’s ex-boyfriend’s new girlfriend. We were feminists so we knew it wasn’t the new girlfriend’s fault but she was from Iowa and easy to hate so we hated her with a political conscientiousness befitting smart young women who want to support other smart young women. Except that we thought she was dumb. Her Instagram was comprised of photos of pasta dishes and charcuterie boards she had made. She had a fashion Blogspot and in all her selfies wore contour, smoked eyeshadow and red lipstick, even though everybody knows you should only pick one out of three. Online she called herself a ‘shameless Sagittarius’, an ‘introverted Swiftie’, a ‘self-taught sommelier’. Her family were all Republicans, or so we’d heard, and when we looked up their address the house had a pool and a long, manicured walk. Every tidbit we found added fuel to the fire: she was short, she worked in marketing, she made TikToks, she was gluten-free. We were nice girls and we wanted to save her from herself, but also from Eloise’s ex-boyfriend, who was clearly taking advantage of someone so naive. We considered it our moral obligation to protect Midwestern girls from older city guys we knew were bad news. When we went out for drinks we saw how the transplants gallivanted down the sidewalks in groups, all dressed up in their faux-fur coats, blow-dried hair, little heeled booties. Like baby elephants grappling for a tail to hold. These women needed us. We kept an eye out for predators.

Eloise and the ex-boyfriend had dated for five years and when they broke up it took an additional year to sort through their shared belongings. Eloise took her table, her cat, her collection of Japanese kitchen knives. Her ex-boyfriend fought her on the knives, so we told her to fight him on the Bluetooth speaker, even though it had never worked well and she didn’t really want it. She pretended to want the couch, as advised, so that she could take the coffee machine too.

The last time they spoke had been a year to the day after their break-up, when Eloise went to collect the last of her books. The ex-boyfriend hadn’t even boxed them up, just left them in a stack on the kitchen counter. He found a shoebox in his closet and handed it to her. The books hardly fit.

‘What the fuck?’ Eloise told us she said. ‘Whose shoes are these?’

‘Yours?’

The shoebox was from Target. Heeled espadrilles with ribbon ties. Women’s size 8.5.

‘Absolutely the fuck not,’ Eloise said.

From there the story gets a little confused. Eloise throws the box at the ex-boyfriend, or sits down in a chair and cries, and they end up ordering Hawaiian fusion and dissecting the particulars of their break-up again. Or maybe she storms out and he runs after her, into the hallway, apologizing, insisting they’d broken up a year ago and so, of course, he’s moved on by now. He had to. He knows how to comfort Eloise the way a person only knows after five or six years of loving somebody, and when Eloise cries he stands close to her but they do not touch. It’s the not touching that makes it horrible. Maybe that’s when Eloise starts to cry. He tells her he loved her. He’s always loved her. He will always love her. The past and present tense get all mixed up. He tells her he has been seeing a girl, but it’s not serious, she’s not his girlfriend. Maybe Eloise says fuck you, or maybe Eloise says she hopes you’re happy, or maybe Eloise says that’s all fine, it’s seriously none of her business. But later it comes out that the new girlfriend was in the apartment the whole time, which Eloise will term a ‘colossal betrayal-cum-humiliation’, though her ex-boyfriend will say it was all a ‘big misunderstanding’, and later tell mutual friends that Eloise is ‘just kind of crazy’. He also uses the phrase ‘rumor mill’. That bit everybody knows for sure, because the new girlfriend goes around quoting it in his defense, and this gets back to Eloise, and so it gets back to us.

The problem with the new girlfriend is that she’s nice. It’s all anybody has to say about her. There’s really nothing we can dislike, except for the fact she exists, which isn’t her fault. That’s on her Republican parents. Instead the group chat is forced to look beyond first impressions. We craft a fuller picture, seeking out all her angles to really celebrate them. In tagged photos her eyes always skew in the wrong direction or glow camera-flash red. That’s when she really comes alive for us. We understand what she sees in Eloise’s ex-boyfriend because we understood what Eloise saw in him, even if we now call him ‘that idiot’. What we can’t understand is how a person who was in love with Eloise, the way we love Eloise, our brilliant, beautiful Eloise, could also be in love with the new girlfriend. We pity the ex-boyfriend who has clearly gone mad with grief, stabbed his eyes out like Oedipus and tied himself to the mast of a ship, Odysseus-style, to wait for any old siren to save him from the misery of his own making. The new girlfriend isn’t a siren though, she’s a field mouse. She looks like she’s never gotten wet in her life. She has a Pinterest board for ‘brunch vibes’. She has a Pinterest board called ‘spooky season’. She has a Pinterest board filled with images of Margot Robbie, and it’s clear from the number of photos that someone once told the new girlfriend that she looks like Margot Robbie – though she doesn’t, not at all, she’s just blonde. When Margot Robbie cuts her hair short, so does the new girlfriend.

‘It looks good,’ Eloise says, though we disagree.

When we show the screenshots to Eloise, she always says that we have gone too far. That the new girlfriend deserves to be happy. That her ex-boyfriend does, too. It’s not a good look to be vengeful, Eloise says. She doesn’t know that we have another group chat without her.

The secret group chat always gets active around the holidays, when we are all forced to see our own missing-limb messed-up families. We prefer to share photos from the new girlfriend’s accounts, where she and her four siblings wear matching sweaters and drink champagne with their parents. They have two Christmas trees, one upstairs and one downstairs, one dressed in silver and the other in gold. The new girlfriend wears red lipstick and red leather boots to Christmas dinner. It looks good, we have to admit, even if she doesn’t do the look justice. She is too blonde, too pointy, too much face.

We started the stalking after Eloise told us she couldn’t stop dreaming about the new girlfriend. Long, Jungian sagas in which there was always someone extra in the room, some hidden secret. This was back before we knew anything about the new girlfriend, aside from her espadrille shoes. We diagnosed Eloise with acute bad dreams, which are different from stress dreams and categorically distinct from nightmares. We figured some facts might quell the speculation. It was our duty as friends to put her mind at ease.

We started with Instagram: first, the main feed, then delving deep into tagged. The new girlfriend hadn’t bothered to scrub her history from the record so we preserved it for her, filing her past selves neatly into an archive of our own making. We taxonomized her from pimply teen to roll tide sorority girl. We knew all of her siblings by name. After that we sped through Facebook and Twitter, which were not nearly as fruitful as her Pinterest and blog. Between broken links and ads the new girlfriend turned out to be a prolific writer. She covered subjects of great interest to us, including the best way to make sugar-free toffee pudding, why loving wine did NOT make you a snob, a list of her favorite restaurants to visit in the month of September. We spent the evening trading links through the group chat and quoting from her greatest hits. Then we typed in her username and clicked forgot password, first on a whim, then a few dozen times, so it would look like a hacking attempt.

That night Eloise said she had a dream that she was being driven by a muscled blonde man – hot, she specified – who she seemed to know but not from real life. He kept offering to help her get over the ex-boyfriend – sexually, we presumed – even though it turned out that he was driving her to the ex-boyfriend’s house. When they got there Eloise said she started shaking and crying, begging the blonde man not to take her inside even though she knew he was going to, and when they got to the door the new girlfriend was there and she was brunette and tall, with high cheekbones and a tennis skirt the color of dry corn. You have my nose, Eloise told her, like the old dad joke, thumb pocketed in palm, except Eloise hadn’t meant it figuratively – the new girlfriend’s nose was identical to her own. After that, Eloise said, she forgets what happened.

‘I don’t know how my brain made up a face for this girl,’ she texted the group chat. ‘I thought people in dreams were supposed to be people you had seen in real life, like in Inception.’

‘She doesn’t look anything like that,’ we assured her. ‘She’s blonde.’

‘It’s weird you guys know this,’ she said. She was worried we had a problem with boundaries.

‘People put things online because they want other people to see them,’ we told her. ‘We’re giving her what she wants.’ To support this statement, we created a collective burner account so that we could follow the new girlfriend without exposing ourselves. But soon enough the new girlfriend had blocked us, and we realized our mistake had been anonymity. Nobody wanted a faceless gray bot on their page. So we made up another, this time furnished with photos from a distant cousin’s profile, and made sure to only like the new posts after a sufficient amount of time had passed. This ended up being useful because for a while we had all wanted to follow lots of other women without racking up clutter on our feeds. Now when we scrolled we could keep up with the new girlfriend alongside Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez.

‘Just don’t follow me,’ Eloise said, when we told her our plan. ‘It’s gonna seem like it’s my account or something.’

‘No one would think this is your account,’ we replied. We used emojis in all of the captions. We used hashtags occasionally, too.

‘I use emojis sometimes,’ Eloise said, but she didn’t.

A month later the new girlfriend announced her relationship online. That was a really good day for the group chat. We circled Eloise’s ex-boyfriend, drew arrows between his shoulder and the face of the new girlfriend, compared their photo to others: Angelina and Brad, Obama and Michelle, Kim and Kanye, Beyoncé and Jay-Z.

‘They’re definitely going to break up,’ we determined.

‘I don’t want to know,’ Eloise replied.

‘Beautiful couple,’ we responded to the Instagram story, where Eloise couldn’t see. The new girlfriend liked the message, but she didn’t say anything more. She didn’t even throw us a decent ‘thank you’. In the group chat we all call her an ungrateful bitch, and we’re joking, but really she has no idea how much work we’ve put into this, what big fans we are. One of us is almost always refreshing her stories. We turned on notifications for all of her posts. When she goes dark for a week we are desperate. We yearn. We re-review the classics: the tags, the blog, the LinkedIn. We speculate: maybe she figured us out? Maybe she blocked the account? Now we are managing multiple burners, each of us cultivating a serious following of porn bots and middle-aged Indian men. Maybe she’s doing a ‘digital detox’, but we suspect she would have warned us if it was something so benign. Her silence must be darker, more private. Maybe they’re busy moving in together. Maybe she’s pregnant. Maybe they broke up. Maybe they’re married. Maybe she died. Eloise’s ex-boyfriend offers no helpful hints or clues. He hasn’t posted in years and even when he did the photos were opaque: grayscale sunsets and shots of strange buildings. The occasional vacation carousel. A bearded dragon perched atop a low rock.

Two weeks into the new girlfriend’s silence, Eloise goes on a good date. She sends us a picture and promises he is cuter in person, more interesting than his profile suggests. We put in the requisite efforts. We google. We skim. We say things like, ‘you can totally tell that he’s cuter in person’, though really, we have no way of knowing. His photos are blurry and probably old. None show his teeth, though Eloise tells us they are normal. She’s already felt them with her tongue. In his tagged photos lives another girl, long-haired and leggy. She can be seen surfing, walking a Dalmatian, sun-tanning in a park that looks vaguely familiar. Eloise asks if she looks like her and we say no, though there is a resemblance around the eyes, in the smiling scrunch of the nose. But everyone looks like everyone else online, we say. At least a little bit. This is our working theory, anyway.

The potential new boyfriend invites Eloise to meet his friends at a concert. Everyone agrees: this is a big step. She sends us photos of outfits until she runs out of time, at which point she just puts on the first one, which we figured she would choose from the start. We know these things don’t matter – Eloise always makes a good first impression – but this is our duty as friends.

In the secret group chat we are busy coordinating our own weekend plans. Having endured three weeks of silence from the new girlfriend, we make arrangements to go to her favorite wine bar, described on her blog as both an ‘ideal second date spot’ and a ‘cozy hang’. When we arrive the bar is regular and overpriced, run by a chubby redhead and a tall man with a mustache. We scan the tables for a blonde bob and take turns skirting chairs, texting from the line by the bar, side-eyeing one another upon return. Not her. Not her. Not her. If it is her, though, we have a plan. We’ll be casual. Drop compliments. We can catch her on the way to the bathroom, or ask to borrow a pen for the check. Has she been here before? Does she live nearby? We’ll ask all the right questions until she feels comfortable, until the flow of information becomes endless. We’re girl’s girls and we know how to win a girl over. Look around the bar, there are so many of us. Drinking wine, wearing leather jackets, watching your stories, being good friends. By the time we leave, the new girlfriend will be a whole new woman. That’s what a city can do to a person: toughen them up, straighten them out, set their priorities in order. We can teach the new girlfriend things that Eloise’s ex-boyfriend could never imagine. We can offer her something better. We know just what to say.

She’s not at the bar that night, but we know she’s out there somewhere. We know her so well by now that we feel her presence like a heartbeat. In the mind’s eye of the group chat we envision her reaching for the hand of Eloise’s ex-boyfriend. Tossing his laundry in with her own. Cleaning a spot of toothpaste on the mirror of the apartment he once shared with someone else. How quickly the past might be forgotten if we weren’t here to remember it. We do our job well so that everyone else can move on.

Drunk at the concert, Eloise texts us that the potential new boyfriend’s friends are so fun – we might like them. She posts a video that is all bodies and light, and when her date smiles his teeth are normal, even cute. The video is getting weird traction online though, she says. Recently she has been accumulating new followers, cheerful women with no mutual friends and sweepstakes accounts boasting iPads and cash. At first Eloise thought it was normal – the algorithm is a mystery – but now she’s worried. Unknown accounts are watching her story. Every time she refreshes there seem to be more. They crowd out her friends list and fill her phone with alerts that disappear the moment she opens the app. We tell her to block them, we’ll investigate tomorrow. For now we have to find our own lonely ways home. We text her through the commute and on the gray, unlit walk and up the dark stairs to our beds. But as we wait for sleep via scrolling, we all get the notification at once: the new girlfriend is back. Our prayers have been answered in the form of an Instagram post. We need to coordinate so that we can all see it together, this delicious surprise just for us. We’ll finally have clarity, some much-needed new news. We get so worked up about it that we accidentally text the main chat, where Eloise tells us this has to stop, she doesn’t want us involved in it anymore. But that was only a slip-up, we know what we’re doing. We’re her friends, we’re feminists. We ask Eloise if she’s still having bad dreams and she says no – only sometimes."

    "text": "When he’s fifteen, he and his mother move to a new town and he starts at a new school. It’s not an easy age to do that – the social order of the school is already well established and he has some difficulty making friends. After a while he does make one friend, another solitary individual. They sometimes hang out together after school in the new Western-style shopping mall that has just opened in the town.

‘Have you ever done it?’ his friend asks him.

‘No,’ István says.

‘Me neither,’ his friend says, making the admission seem easy somehow. He has a simple and natural way of talking about sex. He tells István which girls at school he fantasises about, and what he fantasises about doing to them. He says that he often masturbates four or five times a day, which makes István feel inadequate since he usually only does it once or twice. When he admits that, his friend says, ‘You must have a weak sex drive.’

It may be true, for all he knows.

He doesn’t know what it’s like for other people.

He only has his own experience.

One day his friend tells him that he did it with a girl who lives on the other side of the train tracks.

The news is disorienting.

István listens while his friend describes, in some detail, what happened. He tries to work out if his friend is telling the truth or if he’s lying. Though he would prefer him to be lying, he thinks that he’s probably telling the truth. Some of the things he says seem too specific, too surprising, for him to have made them up.

Then, a few days later, he says he talked to the girl and she said she’d do it with István as well.

‘Seriously?’ István says.

‘Yeah,’ his friend says.

István doesn’t know if this means that the three of them will do it together, or just that he’ll do it with the girl on his own.

He is too unsure of himself to ask.

After school the same day, they walk across the footbridge over the train tracks.

It’s already getting dark.

They go down the metal steps on the other side of the footbridge and walk for a while until they arrive at a housing estate. It’s not dissimilar to the one where István and his mother live, only here the buildings, although also made of prefabricated concrete panels, are taller. At the entrance of one of them his friend enters the doorbell number of one of the flats.

A few moments later, without anything being said, the door unlocks and he shoulders through it.

The lift smells of cigarette smoke.

István stares at the wood-effect Formica of its interior as it goes up.

It goes up very slowly, with a continuous creaking and a separate loud ticking sound as it passes each floor.

‘You okay?’ his friend asks him.

‘Yeah,’ István says.

‘You look terrified,’ his friend says.

‘No,’ István says.

They leave the lift at one of the upper floors and his friend knocks on the door of a flat. It’s opened by a girl of about their own age. ‘Hi,’ she says.

‘Hi,’ István’s friend says.

She stands aside for them to step into the entrance hall.

‘This is my friend,’ István’s friend says. ‘You know. The one I told you about.’

‘Okay,’ the girl says.

She and István look at each other for a moment.

‘Okay?’ István’s friend says.

‘Yeah,’ the girl says.

The three of them just stand there.

The girl looks at István again.

He doesn’t look at her.

‘Okay,’ István’s friend says.

‘D’you want to wait in there?’ the girl says to him, indicating a door.

‘Yeah okay,’ István’s friend says. It’s possible that he seems disappointed, as if maybe he wasn’t sure himself whether or not they were going to do it all together, and had been sort of hoping that they would be.

István is lighting a cigarette, having to work the lighter a few times to get a flame.

His friend makes eye contact with him for a second and smiles.

István doesn’t even try to smile back. He feels something almost like panic.

He follows the girl along a short dark corridor and into a room at the end of it.

He doesn’t really take this room in, except that there’s a lot of stuff in it, including what seems to be a small animal in a cage.

The girl sits down on a bed that’s there.

István sits on a chair.

‘What’s your name again?’ the girl asks him.

He tells her.

She tells him her name.

‘You alright?’ she says.

‘Yes,’ he says.

They talk for a few minutes. She talks anyway. There are also long silences, during which the sound of the small animal moving in its cage is sometimes audible. She asks him where he’s from.

‘What’s that like?’ she asks when he tells her.

‘It’s okay,’ he says.

They sit there in silence.

She lights a cigarette, maybe just to do something.

After a while, without saying anything, she stands up and leaves.

A few minutes later the door opens again.

István looks up and sees his friend.

He expected it to be the girl.

‘What happened?’ his friend asks.

‘What do you mean?’

‘What happened?’ his friend asks again.

‘Nothing.’

‘She wants you to leave,’ his friend says. ‘What did you do?’

‘Nothing.’

‘Nothing?’

‘Yeah.’

They leave the flat and in the corridor outside his friend says, ‘Okay then, see you.’

‘Aren’t you coming?’ István asks him.

‘No she wants me to go back,’ his friend says.

‘Yeah?’

His friend nods. ‘See you round.’

‘Okay.’

Still not understanding what happened István takes the lift down on his own.

 

‘She said you weren’t sexy. That’s what she said.’ It’s a few days later and his friend is explaining it to him, what happened.

István smokes.

It’s horrible, to have that said to him, and about him, and yet he doesn’t know what to say in answer to it. It seems unanswerable.

‘She said you didn’t seem up for it,’ his friend says.

‘I was up for it,’ István says.

‘She said you didn’t seem to be.’

‘I was.’

After that things aren’t the same with his friend.

They spend less time together.

His friend starts to hang out with other people.

István spends more time on his own.

–

On Sunday he and his mother visit his grandmother. It’s her birthday. He sits there, bored, in her living room while she and his mother talk.

His mother asks him to fill a vase with water for the flowers they brought.

He goes to the kitchen and does that.

The windows are open. It’s a warm day for the time of year.

‘And how are you?’ his grandmother asks him.

‘I’m okay,’ he says.

He stands on the small balcony wishing he could smoke.

In the distance, and further down the hill, he can see the part of the town where he and his mother live.

His mother is telling his grandmother how well he’s doing at school.

His grandmother takes some money from her wallet and gives it to him, apparently as a sort of reward.

His mother tells him to say thank you.

‘Thank you,’ he says.

His grandmother smiles.

She has these travel books. They’re lined up next to each other on a shelf near the TV. Italy, France, Czechoslovakia, the USSR, West Germany, Great Britain. Out of boredom he looks at them while his mother and his grandmother talk. The books have pictures in them, mostly black and white, and a few colour ones too. The colours in them look unnatural somehow, they don’t look like the colours of things in reality.

 

There’s a lady who lives in the flat opposite them. Soon after István and his mother moved into the building, the lady asked his mother if István would be able to help her with the shopping sometimes.

‘What does that mean?’ István said when his mother told him about it.

‘She wants you to go to the shop with her and help her to carry the stuff upstairs.’

‘I don’t want to do that,’ he said.

‘She’s been very helpful to us,’ his mother said.

‘I’m not doing it,’ he said.

‘I told her you would,’ his mother said.

‘You said I’d do it?’

‘Yes I did.’

‘Why?’

‘She’s been very helpful to us,’ his mother said again. ‘And her husband has some sort of heart problem. I’m not going to argue with you about this.’

Since then, once or twice a week, he goes to the supermarket with the lady and helps her to carry the shopping home.

 

After arriving home from school he drops his backpack on the floor of the flat and then leaves again and knocks on the door of the flat opposite.

It’s opened by the lady who lives there and she tells him to wait a minute, which he does, with his hood up and his headphones on, looking down the first flight of stairs to the half-landing, where there’s a line of plants in pots on the floor next to the window. The window is set oddly low in the wall. In fact it extends below the level of the floor.

‘Okay,’ the lady says, locking the door of her own flat.

She has her coat and hat on now and they start down the concrete stairs together.

‘Is it cold out?’ she asks him, as they walk down the stairs.

He has to lift the headphones from his ears to hear her.

‘Is it cold out?’ she says again.

‘Yeah,’ he says.

They pick their way among the puddles on the uneven pavement and wait at the traffic lights.

It seems very light inside the supermarket after the wintry twilight of the street.

The lady frees her hair from her hat and loosens her scarf.

He follows her around pushing the trolley while she puts things into it.

They don’t speak.

Afterwards they walk back to the building where they live, and up the stairs. There’s no lift in the building and their flats are on the fourth floor.

‘You’re very strong,’ she says to him, as he puts the heavy stuff down on her kitchen table.

He doesn’t know what to say to that.

He just nods, and she asks him if he wants some Somloi galuska. Sometimes when they get back she offers him something to eat, something sweet like Somloi galuska.

‘Yeah okay,’ he says.

‘Sit down then,’ she says.

He sits at the table.

The Somloi galuska is in the fridge and she serves a large helping into a glass bowl and puts it in front of him, with a spoon.

‘Thanks,’ he says.

While he eats it she puts the shopping away.

He’s becoming aware that she feels a sort of affection for him, or something. It embarrasses him, and he also quite likes it in a way, even though he doesn’t feel any affection for her.

He doesn’t feel anything for her.

She’s just this old woman, maybe even older than his mother.

It’s like she hardly exists.

‘How is it?’ she asks, putting things away.

‘It’s nice,’ he says.

He eats it quickly, partly because it’s delicious and partly because he wants to be out of there as soon as possible.

When he has finished it he stands up, making the chair scrape loudly on the floor.

‘Okay then,’ he says.

‘Can I kiss you?’ she says.

She’s standing in front of him.

The question is so surprising that he doesn’t know what to say.

He doesn’t even know what she means really.

When he doesn’t say anything she kisses him on the lips. It’s nothing – her lips just lightly touch his for a moment.

‘I’m sorry,’ she says, immediately afterwards.

He just stands there.

‘I think you should go now,’ she says.

Still without saying anything he leaves and walks across the landing and lets himself into his mother’s flat.

–

The lights are on in the classroom, strip lights on the ceiling in translucent plastic boxes. The boxes contain a fair number of dead flies – blurred little shapes that he sometimes stares at while the teacher speaks. Only a few people are even pretending to listen to the teacher, who’s reading aloud from a book. ‘In broad terms, individuals that are more “fit” have better potential for survival. However, modern evolutionary theory defines fitness not by how long an organism lives, but by how successful it is at reproducing. If an organism lives half as long as others of its species, but has twice as many offspring surviving to adulthood, its genes become more common in the adult population of the next generation.’ It’s the last lesson of the afternoon.

Afterwards he walks home.

He’s taking the stairs two at a time when suddenly she’s there, in front of him, holding a small plastic watering can. She’s watering the plants on the half-landing between the floors. He hasn’t seen her since the last time they went to the supermarket together, when they kissed afterwards. ‘Hello István,’ she says, without stopping what she’s doing.

‘Hello,’ he says.

He just stands there a few steps down from her, still panting slightly. To see her again makes it even stranger to think that he actually kissed her.

She asks him if he can come to the supermarket with her.

‘Okay,’ he says.

As usual, they don’t speak to each other while they do the shopping.

It’s only when they’re back in her flat that she says, ‘I’m sorry about what happened the other day.’

It surprises him that she should say that. It makes it sound like she did something to him, whereas the way he’s been thinking about it, it was something that they did together.

‘It’s okay,’ he says.

‘Is it?’ she asks.

He’s not sure what he’s supposed to say.

He doesn’t say anything.

‘Did you tell anyone?’ she asks him.

‘No,’ he says.

He hasn’t told anyone. He has no one to tell. And even if he did, what would he tell them? That he’d kissed someone old and ugly like her?

–

The next time they get back from the supermarket and she asks him if he wants some Somloi galuska, he hesitates and then says, ‘Yeah okay.’

She tells him to sit down and puts a bowl of it in front of him, with a spoon and a folded paper napkin.

‘Thanks,’ he says.

While he eats it she puts the shopping away.

He has just stood up from the table and is wiping his mouth with the paper napkin when she says, ‘Can I?’

It’s obvious what she means.

‘Okay,’ he says, after a few seconds. He doesn’t know why he says that. Some part of him seems to want to.

Her lips lightly touch his for a moment, just like the first time.

‘Thank you,’ she says, not looking at him.

‘That’s okay,’ he says.

Still not looking at him, she waits for him to leave.

When he understands that that’s what she’s waiting for, he walks across the landing and lets himself into his mother’s flat.

After that they kiss every time. It becomes part of what they do when they go to the supermarket. She offers him something to eat, and then she lightly touches her lips to his for a moment, and then he leaves.

–

One day she suggests that they sit on the sofa.

He has never been in her living room. He doesn’t really take it in, except that there’s a balcony at one end, like there is in his mother’s flat, with a balustrade made of panels of green safety glass.

They sit on the sofa.

‘Have you ever kissed anyone properly?’ she asks.

Embarrassed that the answer is no, he pretends not to be sure what she means. He doesn’t say anything anyway.

‘Do you want to kiss me properly?’ she asks.

‘Alright,’ he says.

His heart is unexpectedly thumping.

‘Yeah?’ she says.

He just nods.

He can hear a clock ticking.

She touches her lips to his, like she’s done in the kitchen a few times, only now she keeps them there, and presses them more strongly against his.

Something about the angle at which they’re turned to each other is awkward and they shift their positions slightly.

She moves her lips to his again, and this time she opens her mouth and he feels her tongue on his lips and then opens his own mouth and her tongue goes into it.

He shuts his eyes so that he doesn’t have to see her, so that he only feels her lips, and her tongue inside his mouth.

‘Was that nice?’ she says.

He nods.

‘Do you want to do it again?’ she asks.

‘Okay,’ he says.

They do it again and while they’re doing it one of her hands brushes against his erection, which is pushing out the fabric of his trousers.

He was hardly aware of it himself until her hand accidentally brushed against it.

As soon as that happens, he feels her tense up.

Embarrassed, he pulls away from her.

‘What is it?’ she says, trying to take his hand.

He’s already on his feet.

‘What is it?’ she says again. ‘It’s okay.’

It’s not okay, he thinks, looking down at her.

She disgusts him. Without saying anything else, he leaves.

He goes down the stairs and out of the building and walks around for almost an hour without really knowing where he is or where he’s going.

When he gets back she’s waiting on the landing.

‘Are you okay?’ she asks.

‘Yeah,’ he says.

 

After that he’s sure that he isn’t going to kiss her again. Then, a few days later, when she asks if he wants to sit on the sofa with her, he finds that part of him does.

‘Do you want to?’ she asks.

They’re standing in her kitchen, facing each other.

She’s quite tall, nearly as tall as he is.

‘Okay,’ he says.

He follows her into the living room and they sit on the sofa and start to kiss again, with tongues.

This time, when her hand finds his erection, she seems deliberately not to do anything that might distress him. She just keeps kissing him in the same way and leaves her hand there, on top of his trousers. Then, after a few minutes, she starts to move it slowly up and down. She pushes her tongue further into his mouth so that it’s almost too much, so that he instinctively moves his head away and she slightly withdraws her tongue. Her hand is still moving slowly up and down in a way that he likes, although it’s moving much more slowly than he would move his own hand, and maybe because of that, because it’s moving so much more slowly than he would move his own hand, he realises too late that he’s about to come.

The sound he makes is like a gasp of pain.

A moment later he’s aware of the wetness inside his trousers, and then the smell of it.

It feels like a disaster, what’s happened.

He has no idea what to do, no idea if she will even understand.

She seems surprised too.

She has stopped kissing him.

He isn’t looking at her. He’s looking at the floor, at the fringed edge of the rug.

If he looked at her he would see that she was smiling at him. But he doesn’t look at her. He doesn’t want to see her. He is ashamed and also sort of horrified that he is doing this with someone old and ugly like her.

‘Go on,’ she says, and he stands up and leaves.

 

A little later there’s a knock at the door of the flat.

It’s her.

He wonders if she wants to talk to his mother, who’s still at work – maybe to tell her what’s been happening, an idea that makes him feel something like terror.

Actually it’s him she wants to talk to.

‘Are you alright?’ she says.

She says it in a soft, kind voice that surprises him.

‘Yes,’ he says.

‘What happened before,’ she says. ‘I just want you to know – it’s okay. If you were embarrassed or I don’t know. You don’t need to be. It’s okay.’

He doesn’t say anything.

‘I just wanted to say that,’ she says. ‘That’s all.’

‘Okay,’ he says.

‘Okay,’ she says, and he shuts the door.

–

Sometimes at the weekend he works on her husband’s allotment. Her husband pays him to do that.

The thick mud sticks to his shoes so that after a while his feet feel heavy in them and start to look like lumps of mud themselves.

The lady’s husband says that he can’t do physically demanding work any more.

He has heart trouble, he says.

He has to take pills.

István isn’t really listening. The days are getting warmer. He pulls off his jumper and hangs it on a fence post.

‘You’re a good worker,’ the lady’s husband says, offering him a cigarette. ‘Don’t you smoke?’ he asks when István doesn’t immediately take it.

‘Not really,’ István says. His mother doesn’t know that he smokes and he’s worried that the lady’s husband will mention it to her.

‘What does that mean? Do you want one or not?’

István takes one.

‘For me they’re basically free,’ the lady’s husband says, and explains that he works at the cigarette factory.

‘Okay,’ István says.

He stands there in a damp T-shirt enjoying the smoke and the feeling of the cool air on his sweaty forehead.

There’s the sound of the main road, which isn’t far away.

When they finish work that day, after they have washed their hands at the standpipe, the lady’s husband asks him if he wants a drink.

‘I think we’ve earned one,’ he says.

The place he takes him to is a sort of wine cellar, in a side street not far from the allotment, down some steps from the pavement. The lady’s husband seems to be well known down there. Half-drunk old men say hello to him as he moves through the smoke.

The woman at the bar says hello to him as well and they exchange some chat as he orders the drinks – two white wine spritzers.

The woman lifts a lid set directly in the zinc bar and dips a ladle down there for the wine.

‘This is István,’ the lady’s husband says to her as she does that.

She just raises a painted-on eyebrow.

‘He’s helping me on the allotment.’

‘That’s nice.’

She adds soda to the glasses from a hose. There’s something suggestive about the way her hand holds the hose, István thinks, about the way the soda shoots out when she does something with her fingers.

‘Bit more,’ the lady’s husband says.

She shoots another slug of soda into the glass.

‘Thanks,’ he says.

He offers her a cigarette, which she takes.

‘For me they’re basically free,’ he says.

She nods, as if it’s something she’s heard before, and lets him light it for her.

With the cigarette in her mouth she takes the spritzers, one in each hand, and holds them out for them.

‘I think we’ve earned that,’ the lady’s husband says, as they take their seats at a table.

He lifts his glass towards István for a moment and then drinks half of it in one go.

István starts on his more cautiously.

He doesn’t really like the taste of the wine.

‘How you settling in?’ the lady’s husband asks him. He knows that István is still quite new to the town.

‘Okay,’ István says.

–

The next time they sit on the sofa, she stops kissing and draws away from him. He opens his eyes. ‘Can I?’ she asks, looking at him. She has started to undo his belt.

He just nods.

Awkwardly he raises his hips from the sofa to help her as she pulls the trousers and pants down to his knees.

It’s the first time that anyone else has seen him like this.

It feels strange, to have someone else there, looking at it.

She touches it with her hand, and then lowers her mouth to it.

To be comfortable, though, she has to kneel on the floor.

She kneels on the floor and takes it in her mouth again. He’s looking at the top of her head, at the roots of her hair where the blonde, he now sees, is slightly mixed with grey. He wonders how it is that her teeth aren’t hurting him, that her mouth is so soft. He feels himself already starting to come as he stares up at the ceiling, and then at the balcony, where the afternoon sun is glowing in the green glass panels, and then at the top of her head again, which is moving faster now. And now she’s doing something with her tongue that just . . . It’s almost too much, almost like pain, though not pain, the opposite of pain.

He makes a small, startled sound.

Her head stops moving.

Her mouth slides off him. Her eyes are shut. So is her mouth – she inhales through her nose.

After a few seconds she stands up and leaves and from the kitchen he hears the sound of water in the sink.

He has this peaceful feeling.

For a minute or two he feels extremely at ease, just sitting there looking at the tidy living room, and at the balcony with the sun glowing in the panels of green glass.

On the balcony, in the sunlight, is a big jar with lots of small cucumbers in it, submerged in a sort of milky liquid. Crammed in at the top of the jar is what seems to be wet bread.

She’s making kovászos uborka, fermented pickles.

She comes back and sits down next to him on the sofa, and seeing her he again feels confused and sort of ashamed that he is doing this with someone like her, with a woman who might be older than his mother, who makes kovászos uborka.

She’s stroking his hair.

‘Did you like that?’ she asks.

He nods.

Afterwards he walks down the stairs and sits on a bench in the little park near the housing estate.

There’s a man on the next bench who’s smoking a cigarette.

István asks him if he can buy one.

‘You can have one,’ the man says.

István goes back to his own bench and sits there smoking the cigarette that the man gave him. The dry petals of chestnut flowers fall onto the asphalt path. They move on the asphalt with a papery sound, and when the wind stops they lie still.

–

She shows him her breasts. The nipples are weird – surprisingly big, and brown, and with these little things like warts on them.

When he first sees them he’s slightly disgusted. But then later, thinking about them, he masturbates more than once.

He finds it strange how, at the same time, he can find them slightly disgusting and also be so turned on by them, or by the memory of them.

It’s partly the way she showed them, he thinks.

He was sitting at her kitchen table eating Somloi galuska while she put the shopping away and then, when she had finished doing that, she asked him if he wanted to see them and he said yes, and she just showed them to him – standing there in the kitchen she took off first her shirt and then her bra. It’s the memory of her doing that that turns him on, as much as what they actually looked like. What they actually looked like seems almost irrelevant. Or that they were weird and slightly disgusting might even have had the effect of turning him on more.

When he had finished the Somloi galuska, they went to the sofa and kissed for a while and then she undid his trousers and sucked him off again.

Then he left.

 

The next time it happens she says, ‘I swallowed it.’

‘Yeah?’ he says, still with that peaceful feeling he always has for a few minutes afterwards.

She nods, sort of smiling at him.

‘Okay,’ he says.

‘Will you do something for me?’ she asks.

‘Okay,’ he says.

She takes his hand and puts it between her legs. She lifts her skirt up to her waist – she is wearing black tights underneath it – and puts his hand where she wants it.

She presses it there firmly.

The place where she presses it is soft and yielding through the layers of fabric.

When he does nothing, she starts to move his hand herself.

She positions his fingers precisely.

‘Like that,’ she says. ‘There. Like that.’

She lets go of his hand and he moves it himself.

There’s something wrong with the way he is doing it though.

She takes hold of his hand again, and moves it energetically, pressing it into her. ‘Like that.’

‘Okay,’ he says.

She shuts her eyes.

He keeps doing it until his arm gets tired.

‘Thank you,’ she says, when he stops.

–

On Sunday his mother takes him to lunch at the McDonald’s in the new shopping mall. The McDonald’s only opened a few months ago.

His mother watches him eat. She isn’t eating herself. She has a paper cup of McDonald’s coffee that she occasionally takes a sip from. ‘How’s school?’ she asks.

‘It’s fine,’ he says.

‘At the parent–teacher meeting last week,’ she says. ‘They said you seem distracted sometimes.’

He shrugs.

‘Your marks have slipped a bit.’

‘Yeah?’ he says.

‘I wonder if it’s that you’re spending too much time playing those computer games,’ she suggests.

‘No,’ he says.

‘Then?’

‘What?’

‘I’m just trying to understand,’ she says. ‘Are you making friends?’

‘Yeah.’

‘Yeah?’

He nods, not looking at her.

‘That’s good,’ she says.

He isn’t sure if she believes him or not.

–

He and the lady walk to the supermarket. It’s raining. He holds the umbrella over them both. ‘I want to make love with you,’ she says when they are in her kitchen again. ‘I want to feel you inside me. Do you want to do that?’

‘Okay,’ he says.

‘Is your mother at home?’

‘No,’ he says.

They do it on his bed. She insists on the window shutter being fully lowered – maybe because of what happened when she showed him her breasts, the look of slight disgust or whatever it was that she must have seen on his face then.

She puts the condom on him herself. He lies on his back on the bed and she lowers herself onto him. He just lies there while she moves her hips and makes quiet noises. He can’t really see her in the near-darkness with the shutter down.

A few moments after he comes she stops moving.

He feels himself shrink inside her until his dick slides out. It feels like it sort of slides out sideways. It’s a strange feeling.

She leans down to him so that he smells her breath when she says that he’s a man now, and asks him how that feels.

He thinks it’s strange that he doesn’t feel any different, that nothing seems to have changed. He doesn’t say that. He just sort of shrugs, still lying there on his back, and she moves away from him and starts to get dressed again.

‘Are you alright?’ she asks, when he doesn’t say anything for a while.

‘Yes,’ he says.

‘Okay,’ she says. And then speaking to him out of the near-darkness she says that she feels honoured that he did it for the first time with her, and thanks him, and then she leaves, and he doesn’t move for a while.

He has a shower.

In the shower he gets hard again and masturbates.

It takes him a long time to come.

When he finally does, he leans against the tiled wall and listens to the water pecking at the plastic shower curtain, still thinking that it’s strange that he doesn’t feel any different, that everything seems to be the same.

He takes the bus into town and has a Big Mac Meal.

It’s early evening when he gets back. The street lights have just come on, all at the same time. Their light looks green which makes the sky look purple.

He meets her husband at the entrance of the building.

‘Hello István,’ he says. ‘How are you?’

‘Okay.’

‘After you,’ her husband says, holding the heavy front door open for him. It’s made of metal with two panels of security glass. István goes in first and they walk through the low entrance hall past the mailboxes and up the concrete stairs together.

‘What have you been up to?’ her husband asks.

‘Nothing much,’ István says.

–

For a few days he doesn’t see her. He masturbates quite a lot, at least twice a day. Usually when he does that he’s thinking of her, and of the things they have done together. Otherwise he doesn’t think of her much. Except that he finds he does want to fuck her again. After a while he is unable to stop thinking about that, and the thought that it might not happen again is surprisingly difficult to deal with. Sometimes he wonders if he should knock on her door. Something always stops him.

Then, at the end of the week she knocks on his door. He pauses the computer game that he’s playing and opens it.

‘Hello,’ she says.

He doesn’t say anything, embarrassed that he already has a hard-on at just the sight of her standing there.

He puts his hands in his pockets.

She asks if he can come to the supermarket with her.

‘Okay,’ he says. ‘I’ll put my shoes on.’

She nods.

They walk to the supermarket initially in silence as usual.

Then, as they wait at the traffic lights, she says to him, ‘What are you listening to?’

‘What?’ he says.

‘What are you listening to?’

He has his headphones on and is listening to music.

‘MC Hammer,’ he says.

‘What’s it like?’

He shrugs.

‘Can I listen?’ she asks.

He passes her the headphones, and she puts them over her ears.

‘I don’t like it,’ she says, after only a few seconds.

‘Okay,’ he says.

When they get back he puts the shopping on her kitchen table. It’s a warm day and his T-shirt is sticking to his skin.

She asks him if he wants some ice cream.

‘Okay,’ he says.

‘Sit down then,’ she says.

He sits and waits while she serves him some ice cream in one of those glass bowls she has.

‘Rákóczi túrós,’ she says.

‘Okay,’ he says.

‘You like that don’t you?’

He nods.

While he is eating it she sits down next to him. After just sitting there for a minute, she puts her hand on his knee.

‘Is your mother at home?’ she asks.

‘No,’ he says.

 

‘Try not to come so quickly,’ she says.

She twists and thrusts her hips while he lies there looking at the underside of the pine shelf on the wall above his bed.

Her movements become more urgent and he has a strange feeling that she’s no longer aware of him.

Suddenly she stops moving altogether.

There’s a moment of tension.

Then something happens.

She goes limp.

She puts her arms around him and lies still for a minute.

He feels the sweat on her, and on himself. It’s hard to say whose sweat it is. There’s a slippery layer of sweat between them.

Outside the sun is shining. The shutter is down but there are some small holes in it which let a bit of light through, enough to see her as she dresses, now that his eyes are used to the gloom.

She has pubic hair, and a track of hair on her belly.

In porn none of the women have pubic hair, or not that much anyway.

None of the women have weird nipples like hers.

 

As long as no one knows about it, it’s like it isn’t really happening.

It’s like it exists in the same way that his fantasies exist, as something he’s just imagining.

That’s how it seems to him sometimes.

 

He doesn’t see her at the weekend, when her husband is at home.

He just wanders around the town.

He spends a long time in the second-hand shop looking at the computer games, the crate of cassettes in scuffed plastic boxes. The games are pirate copies, with badly photocopied instructions.

There’s pirated music too, all the latest stuff from the West – Vanilla Ice, Madonna, Guns N’ Roses.

He leaves the shop without buying anything.

The weekend seems to last forever.

 

On Monday they do it twice. In between they just lie there on the bed. There’s the sound of the rain on the window – they can hear it sometimes but they can’t see it because the shutter is down. After they have been lying there for a while she starts to suck him and he quickly becomes hard again. ‘Do you want to take me from behind?’ she asks.

‘Okay,’ he says.

She turns, and he sort of kneels on the soft mattress trying to find the place.

The rain patters on the window.

‘No not there,’ she says.

She has to reach back with her hand to help him.

She’s already extremely wet.

It feels different from that angle.

She worries, afterwards, that they didn’t use a condom the second time.

He isn’t sure why she’s worrying – he assumed she was too old to get pregnant.

How old are you?’ he asks her.

‘Forty-two,’ she says.

    "text": "‘Anyway,’ their dining companion concluded, ‘to most people, this is more acceptable than that.’ She waved her fork on the diagonal, pointing first to her husband and herself, then to them. She and her husband were the this and they were the that. ‘Oh come on,’ she added, as if exasperated by their incomprehension. ‘Of course it matters which one of you is white.’ It was a very long dinner toward the end of an even longer year. After, they walked home along the river, just the two of them.

‘I think we’re becoming unsocialized.’

‘Yes, that must be it.’

The advice, if that’s what it was, was discarded from their minds, lightly as an empty tissue box. They didn’t remember it until a few hundred miles into the road trip when, as is so often the case, you find yourself in need of tissues – he had just sloshed cold coffee across his lap (‘Shit!’) – and when, glancing out the window, you discover that you have no idea where you are. They’d spent the morning at Gettysburg. Now it was afternoon, and Jefferson Davis Highway unfurled seedily before them. Her uncle, an estranged relation getting on in years, lived somewhere off it; it was with him they’d spend the night. Meanwhile they ate up mile after mile with the amazement of people who’ve never driven this far south before.

‘– a whole highway named after him!’

‘– can you believe – !’

‘Go straight,’ directed the woman inside the phone, ‘for two hundred kilometers.’ The road signs spoke miles, but Anand refused to trade the units he’d grown up with for a system demonstrably less sensible. He loaded up the playlist.

On the horizon, strong evidence of a storm.

‘I thought we were too far inland for hurricanes.’

‘General apocalypse, I guess.’

They took road trips like these once or twice a year. As the papers were fond of pointing out, many millions of millennials were reluctant to leave the coasts, had never even Googled Yellowstone. And even if they did, or would, what they’d find was pictures of the thousands of foreign tourists who arrived by Megabus each year to watch the geysers go.

So maybe the roadtrippers were entitled to feeling a bit superior. But they were still strangers in their own nation. Everyone is, if you drive far enough.

‘But I am a foreigner.’

‘You just got citizenship. You’re stuck with us now.’

And what a big country it was! They’d taken the week to see some more. He’d autoreplied his .org inbox; she, her .edu. They’d filled the rental tank, stocked the cupholders with snacks, and taken off over the Verrazano. They didn’t have to go so far before everything became unfamiliar. Really, just over the Verrazano. They rolled down the windows. The direction was south; the goal, Savannah. A Senate race was imminent, and they planned to knock on some doors.

Not until Jefferson Davis Highway did the dining companion’s comment return. Diana was fishing through the plastic sacks for chips and further napkins.

‘I wonder if we’re not exactly the volunteer profile they’re looking for?’

 

New York had the reach of cottonwood or pollen. It defined an ecosystem all its own. Only midway through Pennsylvania did you escape its sweep and a new kind of flora emerge: narrower roads; affordable real estate; tractor trailers galumphing down lane one. The Midwest loomed somewhere in Erie. You could tell by the way the land flattened and the woodlands narrowed to windbreaks between the farms, and by the layout of the convenience stores, which shared in common taupe wire shelves and the tart, musty smell of packaged bread. Onward to Ohio, where the interstates swung wide around modest skylines, giving the buildings wide berth, working up the centrifugal momentum to speed through Indiana, Illinois, on to someplace worth the hotel costs. Montana, maybe. Or Sun Valley, Idaho, where the vacation homes returned and the all-inclusive tour buses glided through bruised and violet landscapes as alien as advertised . . . That was last year’s trip. On the way, they’d visited her parents in Indianapolis.

‘Never again,’ she said, propping her feet up on the dash.

‘It wasn’t so bad.’

Now the South came in thick and choppy through the open windows. He loved to drive. She didn’t think he should (climate!), but what an experience, the roads of this country. It was stomach-turning, really, how roomy a nation could be. The interstate was god. Anand believed. He’d grown up in the kind of metropolis where traffic sorts itself into sedimentary layers, socialist-era cars fanning out to rickshaws, bicycles, cows, goats, chickens, foot traffic, loiterers, schoolkids, scooters that darted every which way, honking at the schoolmarm signs: No horns! Once, during a period of communal unrest, his cab driver had tapped a man’s thigh with the car. He’d nearly run him over. Such accidents were more common than Diana might have guessed. The real mistake had been getting out of the vehicle to check on the pedestrian in the gathering crowd, when tensions were so high . . .

CCR whined from the dash.

There was hardly any foot traffic in this country, certainly not on Jefferson Davis Highway.

‘Slow down,’ Diana cried, as he wedged the rental between two semis. ‘Slow down, slow down, slow down!’

 

No matter where they drove, what borders they crossed, Anand preferred to traverse new terrain with guidebooks, apps, recommendations solicited from email chains and message boards. Museum tours were researched in advance and audio guides reserved. This was a major difference between them. It was to Diana’s great relief, then, arriving at Gettysburg earlier that morning, that the museum was fresh out of auditory apparatuses. She’d gone to the car to change her shirt while Anand had made absolutely sure. They’d commenced, regretfully or mercifully, depending on your perspective, with nothing but their phones.

One did not have high hopes for Gettysburg. Nor for Pennsylvania in general. Having grown up in Indiana, Diana felt she’d earned her condescension. It broadcast her distance. But Gettysburg was on the way and in the end had outperformed. They exited the visitor center and into the scorch of national lore. It was hard to see, in such weather, the advantage of wool uniforms.

‘Actually –’

‘I’m joking, it was a joke,’ she said.

The battlefield lay across a narrow road. They paused to allow a sky-blue pickup truck to pass. The driver also slowed, stopped, looked them over. After a halting pause – should they, shouldn’t they, would he squash them to a pulp? – he waved them across.

The sun was high, the air heaving and humid. The heat formed a blister over the grass. Outside a modest whitewashed house, the kind of structure raised in a day by horse and rope, they read a little plaque. Here was Union HQ, it said. Ahead, the lawn descended the gentle slope that had given General Meade such a historically significant edge. They stood there an extra beat, rereading the same sentences multiple times. Anand suppressed a smile.

‘What’s so funny?’

‘Same to you.’

She laughed. ‘Nothing’s funny.’

It came to light that they’d both been wondering what the driver of the pickup had thought about a couple like them.

 

Even someone with zero knowledge of military strategy (and this was Diana to a fault) could recognize, standing atop the knoll, how terribly advantageous it was to defend an attack from above. You could see everything. (There, in the distance, were the woods where the Confederates had chilled themselves, sleeping in the dew in non-wicking cotton.) In the scant shade of a copse, a guide was addressing a pair of women at opposite extremes of the weight distribution: a thin, nervous-looking specimen tried so hard to disappear beneath her sun hat that you couldn’t help but stare, while her capacious friend radiated a generous attention. (If Diana had had a musket, she thought, neither would stand a chance.) Anand consulted the map. The thing to do was walk across the field, clamber over the fence, and peek into the woods where the Confederates had begun their charge. It really was quite a ways to march. Off they went. They clambered. They arrived. They peered into the trees.

‘That’s that.’

On their return, by the copse, another memorial plaque made an appearance; on it, someone had laid a bouquet in honor of fallen Confederates. The roses were a deep, expensive red. Anand shook his head.

In the car, hours later and hundreds of miles south, a deep sunburn bloomed across Diana’s shoulders.

‘I wore long sleeves!’

‘Should’ve tried wool!’

 

Anand thought it very strange that Diana had never met her uncle, especially as she had no other uncles or aunts or cousins to meet. ‘That’s wild,’ he’d said, when he found out. Diana shrugged. She hadn’t met a lot of her family.

‘Salt and vinegar, or sour cream and onion?’

She handed Anand more napkins for his lap and popped open the tube of chips. (Sour cream and onion.) He was probing the matter again, she felt, like a kid left alone on the beach with a stick. Was it an argument, an affair, an inheritance dispute? She snorted, spewing crumbs.

‘What inheritance!’

It was none of these things.

She turned to the trees and gas stations of the anonymous landscape outside. ‘I did visit once. Right after college. I drove all the way down. He didn’t show. So, I guess don’t get your hopes up.’

Together, Jefferson Davis and Anand drew the rest of the story out of her. The truth was, there had a been a cousin once, seven years her senior, whom she’d also never met. This too was wild. Was it? She was used to silences. It was much more like her family to let things lie. The cousin had died at fourteen of a rare strain of blood cancer. It was too hard on everyone, in the following years, to present another little girl who reminded them so much of her.

‘Honestly, maybe we shouldn’t. I can look up the motel I stayed in last time. It had a pool.’

Diana reached for her phone. Anand covered the screen.

‘It’s a good thing to do,’ he said. ‘I’m proud of you.’

She cradled the chips. ‘Maybe just keep your eyes on the road.’

The remaining facts she knew about the uncle were few. For example, he was the only other person in her family to have earned a college degree. In the arts, specifically, courtesy of the GI Bill and the Korean War. Active duty had left him a little eccentric. It was his degree, however, that her parents most commented on. Her own mother was a typist, skilled enough in shorthand to have chanced Chicago, where she’d met Diana’s father, a bridge player at the time. He played professionally for years before earning his accounting license. Neither had seen the point of university back then, but pity the person who thought it was because they hadn’t been clever enough. When Diana had come home junior year chattering about her history thesis (‘Messianic Expectations in Socialist Yugoslavia, 1929–1992’), her father had remarked, not a little saltily, ‘Sounds like a load of over-intellectualized bullshit to me.’ It had stung at the time. But she’d been all of twenty, and her father wasn’t quite wrong. Though, following the logic through, that still didn’t make him right.

Her father had performed many jobs over the years. Taxi driver. Lab assistant. Bookkeeper. Carpenter. He was rather proud of Diana, she knew, whether or not he had the words, and frankly she was proud of him, too. The problem was expressing it. The problem was that she felt ashamed of her parents at times, or perhaps the better word was confused. She didn’t know how to place them. It was like showing up for dinner with an unruly bouquet to find the host keeps only a delicate little vase. The first time her parents had met Anand, over tourist spaghetti in Manhattan (‘Miserable fucking city,’ was her father’s – again – not totally incorrect pronouncement), they’d complimented his English, by which they meant that they were surprised that he spoke it much better than they did. ‘Thanks,’ Anand said. ‘It is definitely my first language.’ He added that a lot of the students back home spoke better English than their teachers, who came from more modest backgrounds. Her parents nodded, uncomprehending. Diana considered drowning herself in her personal vat of spaghetti.

The exit appeared. She held out a chip to Anand. He ate it out of her hand. ‘Narm narm num,’ he articulated.

A final thing Diana knew about her uncle was that her own college tuition had been drawn from the fund her cousin had never had the chance to use. After she died, it had sat there, accruing interest, for eleven intervening years.

‘It’s nothing to feel guilty about,’ Anand said.

It really was a beautiful country, as long as you had no memory.

Wrung of its history, the land greets its visitors with the complete indifference of a stolen thing.

 

The uncle lived on a cul-de-sac in a neighborhood comprised of what had once been called starter homes but which now bore the signs of urban decay. The sky was still and gray when they arrived, draped ominously low over the roofs. The house sat on a respectable stretch at the far edge of the development, abutting a strip of trees. The driveways were designed for one car each, though most held two, none of them new.

She would have been able to guess which was her uncle’s even without the address. Part of her still hoped she was mistaken.

Improvised sculptures were staked all over the weedy lawn. The majority were abstract. One was definitely a shotgun. The hedges at the door were not so much hedges but brush, and the house was in visible disrepair. The eaves sank; the roof buckled; the shingles were ripe with moss. After decades sculpting models for a local automobile plant, now her uncle lived alone and made the art he liked, apparently in vast quantities. His wife, much younger, had left after their daughter died.

At the door, Diana knocked. Anand followed with the bags.

‘No one home?’

‘Looks like no.’

‘I’m sure he’ll come.’

They sat on the front step to wait.

Anand was correct. It wasn’t long before her uncle made his memorable entrance. He sped in on a dirt bike in a flurry of dust and growling noise. The brakes throttled backwards; his was the torso of a much younger man. Diana had only ever seen a picture, and that he’d seemed handsome then was confirmed again as he removed the helmet with its long, pointed chin. His white hair was full and cropped, his features set deep in a face almost gaunt. Diana was grateful Anand remained so reliably delicate when it came to first impressions.

‘Wow,’ he said. ‘Nice bike.’

Thirty minutes later, her uncle was leading Anand in circles around the house, teaching him to ride. It had never occurred to Diana that riding a motorcycle –’Sorry, sorry, not a motorcycle . . . !’ – required so much balance. There were no three-wheeled dirt bikes, of course, and one had to start somewhere. It certainly made a racket. She kept waiting for one of the neighbors to come out and complain, but either they were used to it or they had fled long ago. Anand, straddling the roaring engine, tapped along the green on tiptoe, weaving through the crowded sculpture garden whose rusted copper shapes erupted in teal and pink and orange. Her uncle, at his elbow, guided him patiently. So patiently, in fact, that it was almost as if he didn’t want to go inside. It was dark by the time Anand was able to circle the cul-de-sac on his own. Still parked on the front steps, Diana clapped when he pulled into the drive. Her uncle lumbered over. A silence swelled with the ridiculous things neither could bring themselves to say: Nice to meet you . . . So here we are . . . Uh, thanks for paying my tuition . . . Diana drummed her hands on her thighs.

Her uncle spat thickly into the bushes. ‘You sure you don’t want to try?’

 

The house was crammed with family pictures and more art, two bedrooms, and a bath wedged between. Diana set out her toothbrush and face wash and expensive creams at the sink. She reapplied some much-needed deodorant. Anand was in their room, humming eighties hits from their road trip playlist and setting out a change of clothes. Back home, in high school, he’d played briefly in a cover band; he broke fully into song.

‘Maybe if you joined a different band –’

‘If you want an autograph, just ask.’

‘The very occasional silence can also be harmonious.’

The purple bed was piled with pillows, as if a seasonal sale were going on: last call for throw cushions in aisle four. A border of ivy crawled along the baseboards. It was undoubtedly a little girl’s room. The violet plush of the carpet crunched, stiff with lack of use.

Diana shouldered her purse and surveyed the luggage. ‘Is my bag still in the car?’

‘I thought you brought yours in yourself.’

The asphalt released the day’s heat into the night. Diana hopped from one bare foot to the other in the driveway, looking into the rental trunk. No luck.

In the purple bedroom, they backtracked, recreating the afternoon. It had been so hot and clear in Gettysburg: while Anand was inquiring as to the audio guide options, she’d returned to the car for long sleeves to avoid the very sunburn she’d nevertheless incurred. She mimed opening the trunk of the rental car:

‘– I took out my bag –’

‘– and put it where? –’

‘– and then I took off the shirt I was wearing –’

‘– right in the middle of the parking lot? –’

‘– and then –’

‘– and then you put on this shirt? –’

‘– obviously, and then –’

‘– you put the bag back?’

Diana lowered herself to the foot of the bed, her head into her hands. ‘Honestly, how did you not run over it?’

‘Sorry for being such a careful driver!’

She lifted her collar to her nose. ‘I’m already starting to smell.’

It was too late to call the museum. With a sinking feeling, she recalled the public transit warnings in New York: all that lost baggage, needlessly destroyed. She stripped and curled up next to Anand in the bed dressed for a child.

‘I hate sleeping naked in other people’s homes.’

Laughing, he reached for her.

‘No, seriously, it’s weird.’

 

That she’d never known all that much about her family came into focus in the wide-angle lens of adulthood. She didn’t know her family better. But she understood them in a different light. In certain settings or times of day (a party, her office hours, departmental committees), her forebearers were recognized as workers, and worthy of praise; everything real in this country had been produced by hand, preferably an American’s. And yet, as the background sets changed, these very same cafeteria managers, FedEx couriers, self-trained accountants and small-time entrepreneurs now played the knave, not so much the salt of the earth as the runoff that had poisoned it: the kind of people who’d voted, in an act of willful self-annihilation, for the incorrect president.

Diana was fairly confident her uncle hadn’t. She weighed the evidence lying in bed. He wasn’t an especially enthusiastic citizen. He tended to forget to pay his taxes (as she knew from the occasions her father had been called in to help), which of course caused trouble with the law, which in turn introduced in him certain biases against the government. So there was that issue, were he to vote. Though she wagered lack of civic interest had probably won out. Lying awake, still inappropriately naked and decidedly unaroused, she listened to the easy sounds of the storm. Envied Anand his sleep. He wrapped a leaden arm around her. It weighed heavily on her breasts. Gently, she removed it. The eaves shuddered. She stared at the ceiling fan. Ideally she’d have had the chance to prepare her uncle the way she had her parents, to coach him on those things that were and weren’t appropriate to say to someone who had grown up elsewhere and only recently become American. The whole world is a reason to worry at 4 a.m. She pushed herself up from the bed and slipped on her filthy shirt, her wrinkled linen uniform.

Half an hour later, she was at the sink in the kitchen, nursing a cup of leftover coffee she’d found languishing in the globe of the Mr. Coffee pot. The mesh of Anand’s basketball shorts breathed around her knees. His sweet voice still spun in her head – unfortunately what it sang was CCR. She watched the storm. She was about to search the cupboards for snacks or go out to the car for the rest of the chips when the side door snapped open. Her uncle entered from the garage.

There are two kinds of guests, those who naturally make themselves at home, and those perpetually ashamed creatures horrified to be caught doing anything in any room. Diana was of the latter variety, which is to say her uncle’s arrival startled her completely. He was speaking softly to a Pyrex tray of raw chicken thighs. The oven clock cast the pallid skins in a lunar glow.

Diana splashed some water at the coffee she’d spilled onto her shirt.

‘Hello?’

‘The fox . . . the fox . . .’ he said.

Diana’s father often sleepwalked. It must be hereditary. This was a tender thought. She knew just what to do. She took the tray and set it on the counter, so that her uncle’s hands now loosely gripped the air. She affirmed everything he said. ‘The fox, the fox of course, let’s get you back to bed.’ She directed him back into the hall, past all the pictures of his daughter, here posing with a papier-mâché volcano; here in the woods with her little crossbow; here on Christmas in a green velvet dress draped with a wide ribbon sash.

They were at the entrance to his bedroom when he came to. She watched him take in the time, her shorts, her soaked-through shirt.

‘That’s quite the outfit.’

‘I left my bag in Gettysburg.’

Her uncle puzzled a moment longer. She had the feeling of backing into someone else’s nightmare. Then, without warning, he threw back his head and laughed. The response was so alarming she doubted his lucidity. He wiped his eyes.

‘Oh yeah, I Left My Bag in Gettysburg, I saw that on Broadway opening night.’

How was it that she was always pegged the hysterical one? Diana returned to bed in a huff. When she woke, the sky was clear, and Anand was just stepping out of the shower, fresh back from a run.

‘Cool shorts,’ he said.

Looking down, she saw she’d fallen asleep atop the duvet in the mesh, while he had gone running in his nice cotton ones.

 

What do you do with an uncle you’ve never met? Luckily the storm had left them with several chores. Outside, driftwood was strewn over the sculpture garden. They helped to gather it, collecting the branches into neat piles. Then her uncle looked at the sky and said, ‘Screw it,’ because the next storm, signposted in the gathering clouds, would only nuke them again. They cooked the chicken legs to feed the fox who often lingered at the stream, and who was also fed handfuls of peanuts and blueberries. ‘Foxes eat this?’ Of course they did. For lunch the humans too ate chicken legs, hot and unseasoned and dripping with fat, consumed while standing up around the same glass tray. They balanced bones in fingertips. ‘Fucking delicious!’ her uncle said. It was hard not to want to tell an octogenarian to take it easy, hard not to tell him to try, at least, to be a little cautious. He’d survived the Korean War, prostate cancer, a dislocated spine. He’d fallen from the platform where he’d been sighting deer and temporarily paralyzed both legs. Could Anand or Diana have army-crawled back to the car to keep warm until the ambulance arrived? Could they have performed a deadweight pull-up from the ground to reach the driver’s seat? The uncle thought not. Anand leaned on his rake. ‘Agree to disagree.’

He and Diana looked around the yard at the sawhorse, woodshed, dirt bike, tools, the sculptures advancing between the woodpiles like opposing pieces on a chessboard. It was true they were unused to this line of work, to this part of the world. It was enough to scramble your brain. Diana paused to sniff again at the collar of her rancid shirt. With a look either conciliatory or cunning – it was hard to tell with him – her uncle turned to Anand.

‘You know what you could help me with,’ he said. And without further ado, he disappeared around the side of the house.

They found him in the garage at the workbench beside the extra oven he’d installed for cooking in bulk (for the fox?), which excluded the possibility of being able to park a car. Car or no car, he’d always lusted after one of those automatic doors. Now over eighty, he conceded, eventually his back would go, and this time not so temporarily. He held out the hardware to Anand. The box read EZ Glide!.

‘You people are all so handy with IT –’

Diana snatched at the device as if it were a grenade he was about to detonate.

‘I’ll do it, I’ll do it,’ she said.

Halfway up the ladder, electric screwdriver in hand, instruction booklet crumpled on the floor, Diana began to question her gallantry. She listened to her uncle’s welding tips filter through the kitchen door. One detected the cracking open of beers. Now he was inviting Anand to see the basement studio – ‘Where the magic happens!’ – an incantation soon followed by the heavy creak of two grown men descending wooden steps. A creeping jealousy, not entirely unfamiliar, seeped into her chest. The truth was, her family often seemed more comfortable when Anand was around. He had this effect on people. He was easily loved. Whole dinner parties courted his attention. It was obviously one of many reasons she’d fallen in love with him herself; why she was still surprised he’d fallen for her. He appeared more at ease than she was in either of their respective worlds, plus the third they shared. She envied how he drew her parents out. They glowed, flattered; the world had come to them. The initial friction overcome, these days they addressed themselves to him, not their daughter, when the four of them convened. ‘I’m sure that’s not true,’ Anand had said, a statement quickly retracted at the look of protest on her face. ‘Okay, okay, but I’m sure it’s not intentional.’ There was maybe even a mutual anthropological interest there. She couldn’t help now but resent that it was Anand down in the studio with her uncle, to whom he had encouraged her to introduce herself against her every intuition. She notched the electric screwdriver against the wooden frame of the garage and pressed with all her might. At the very least, she would figure out this fucking door. That was for sure. The drill bit sank into the wood. The lintel bracket was secured. Then the drill caught, sputtered, and crashed, ejecting the battery into the drainage grate. Diana, for her part, was left swinging from the lip of the frame, one foot on the ladder, the other flailing free. She caught her breath, her balance, briefly contemplated her uncle’s experience with paralysis. It occurred to her that she could not perform a pull-up of any kind.

Then again, she hadn’t fallen.

Steadying herself, she shifted the ladder to connect the power unit. The contraption blinked. Slowly, the door folded into itself, disgorging the heat of the stilted afternoon. In the dark, the overhead light flickered on.

She was high with success! In the way only very unhandy people are at the first sign of savoir faire. It was a rush. She was feeling, all in all, not exactly herself. Her arms ached with the effort of holding the screwdriver aloft, her heart flooded with adrenaline from her close call. She could feel the sweat and salt on the surface of her skin. And something else, beneath it. She listened to the silence of the house. Her uncle and Anand were still in the cellar. It hardly bothered her anymore.

At the sink, she wrung out her shirt, then splashed her face and underarms and glanced into the mirror. The body there was soft and fragile, completely unsuited to the capable person she suddenly felt herself to be. Oh well. Mirrors lie. Her clothes dripping from the shower rod, she planted herself before the closet doors. The handles were brass blooms, and she harvested them in her palms. Rows and rows of garments appeared, in more or less her size but in better taste. Their curator had been very careful, she realized. Diana passed an admiring hand along the hems. She’d no idea her cousin, older by seven years, or else younger by twenty-three, had cultivated such precocious style. Perhaps she could have taught Diana a thing or two. This imaginary thread cast itself into the past and immediately fell slack. She lifted the sleeve of a gingham shirtdress and let it fall. There were shoulder pads in the jackets and silk linings in the skirts. She was reminded of a novel she’d once read set in colonial Hong Kong, in which a notorious doyenne attempts to turn her school-age niece into a concubine. It’s for her own good; the niece’s prospects are grim. The girl makes her way uphill in the swampy summer, thrashing through the vegetation to the aunt’s opaline palace at the crest. In her new bedroom she opens the wardrobe to a rackful of party dresses. There are outfits for every occasion, tailored right down to her slender, still adolescent waist. Lavender sachets tucked inside each collar keep the garments fresh. Where would she ever wear them? The girl knew immediately, and in spite of her better instincts, that she’d been bought. It was too late; she was in too deep.

In the approaching mid-Atlantic storm, the room was almost tropical; there was no more use in Diana’s resisting the wardrobe. Still, something in her hesitated. She wished to ask permission. Then again, there were at least thirty dresses here. Odds were her uncle wouldn’t notice. The residue from her shower still clung to her collarbone, and the gingham checks blossomed as she slipped the shirtdress on. She cinched the waist. It was a perfect fit.

 

The cellar access was hazardously steep and led directly from the kitchen. From the oven, in fact. Opening the appliance door to check the clearance, Diana was launched onto the landing. She stood there. The men’s voices rose up to meet her. Anand was asking polite questions (How had he gotten started? What was this machine? Perhaps a demonstration?). Then, after a while, he no longer was. It was just her uncle speaking.

One did not harbor high hopes for her uncle’s studio (one had seen the lawn), but that’s not what this descent was about now, was it? She lowered herself onto the top step. He wasn’t talking about art anymore. Or maybe he was. What did she know? Her father was right. What a real bullshitter she was. She turned an ear to the cellar depths. It was the war that had risen to the surface of the conversation there, like oil on the highway after rain. Her uncle had been stationed in the trenches along the 38th Parallel. (Cartographers are the true warmongers.) His tone was distant, as if the memory were speaking of its own, disembodied accord. It wasn’t easy to describe, he said, what it was like to survive only just barely in touch with your limbs. Imagine Christmas Eve. The perspective is age eighteen. Everything sinks. Boots. The men inside of them. They disappear into the snow. The Chinese are blasting carols across no man’s land. This was the void: hearing ‘Jingle Bell Rock’ in a trench in the dead of night in a proxy war at the end of the world. Maybe it wasn’t ‘Jingle Bell Rock.’ But it should have been. Could any carol make a better weapon? The point was he needed no reminder of the reasons to fear his country. He’d seen its pulsing heart, packed in bloody snow. A note of hysteria laced his story now. He asked Anand, ‘You sing?’ He’d had his own way with music once, he said. As did every kid back then. You played the campsites until the draft letter came, then left the instrument and your old man’s disappointments behind. A shivery tremor sang out. Diana descended.

Her uncle stood beneath the basement’s single exposed bulb, holding a sonorous sheet of copper. It rang triumphant, like a gong. Anand sat on the workbench, looking as if he too had just survived a tour. He watched Diana arrive. Following his gaze, her uncle turned. Who was this apparition at the bottom of the stairs? For the first time, he struck Diana as old. She drew up a stool. Without protesting, he sat. His chin fell to his chest. She knelt to check his pulse and pupils. They were in accord. In her head, a horrid clanging chorus. She demonstrated deep breaths. ‘Come on, you too,’ she said. He patted her hands with his. It was the gesture of an elderly man. His eyes were clouded yet clear, like an early sky; soon the heat would burn away the fog. The crisis was not of medical origin, she decided, but something more obscure. ‘I’m sorry,’ she said. ‘I left –’ Yes, yes, the musical. He breathed in. It took ages. She hooked an arm under his. ‘Up, up then, let’s go upstairs.’ Again, he didn’t protest. His weight against her was totally insignificant, as if the fate of everybody were a slow evaporation; eventually, we disappear, a bit more humidity released into the air.

Anand, still listening from the workbench, heard Diana say,

‘You’ve got yourself an automatic garage door now.’

 

They got her uncle to bed. It was midafternoon, and the daylight felt foreign after the basement. They retreated into their own ersatz room, where Anand drew the curtains.

‘That was intense.’

He collapsed onto the pillows, and Diana followed suit. They lay side by side in the restrained sun. Diana’s legs were folded, uncouthly froglike, under the hem of her dress.

‘Did you know any of that?’

She didn’t respond. He kissed her. Pressing himself into her, he felt the new sharpness of her bones and wondered when it was she’d lost so much weight. How rudely people change. Though she pulled him close, touching him the way he liked, something stayed stiff and unyielding inside the gingham. He had a hand in the skirt, exploring essences, before he too gave up. The entire affair felt wrong for reasons that were vague on the whole but intuitive in the particulars. ‘These fucking pillows.’ He tossed one to the floor and put his warm hands to his ribs. ‘I feel a little sick.’ Diana smoothed his face. Stroked his sweaty temples.

‘Come on,’ she said. ‘You haven’t seen the garage yet.’

 

They stood barefoot on the cool cement, watching the door unfold itself again and again, a gigantic lolling tongue. ‘You did good.’ ‘I know!’ She punched the remote and the garage growled to a tight-lipped state. They watched it open and close, open and close. The mechanics left them hungry. They went out to feed the fox, then themselves. From the kitchen window, they watched the vixen nudge the bowl they’d left by the overflowing stream, all the while shoveling handfuls of blueberries and peanuts into their own mouths. ‘I could live like this,’ she said. ‘I’m starving,’ said Anand. They were two children who’ve stumbled on an abandoned house in the woods, eager to see what the owners have left behind. A box of pasta, a can of tomatoes. Onions and garlic sprouted behind the pantry door.

The radio switched on, announcing her uncle’s return. He emerged from the bedroom with boom- and pillbox tucked under his arm. In the kitchen, he slipped a CD into the plate, then counted out a permutation of pale capsules and washed them down. There were good days and bad days, he explained, and many in between. The wind picked up. The storm unfurled luxuriously, like a dark sheet of crushed silk. The table crowded with heaping bowls of pasta and rows of votive candles. Anand sat across from Diana. She flickered in the candlelight, still in her gingham dress. The music was far too loud for conversation, you could hardly hear the wind. When the power went out, the world plunged into a 24-karat darkness. The battery-powered Beach Boys clanged on. Something of that bandstand genius, Anand thought, echoed in every American song. Diana’s uncle asked for bread. The gingham strained horribly against her breasts as she passed it to him – she was a woman, this was a child’s garment. The exchange precipitated a housewife’s loving look. Anand dropped his eyes.

The car keys were in his pocket, and he registered their weight as the chorus spun around once more. Here was the music, the storm, the inertia, the heat, the awful commotion of a single discography set eternally on repeat. Kilometers of highway stretched ahead. But it was far too late; he was in too deep."

    "author": "Wang Zhanhei",
    "date": "2024",
    "url": "https://granta.com/goodbye-bridge-of-the-east",
    "text": "Imight be mistaken, but I think that in all my years of dating, Wu Jiayu was the very first repeat customer.

By the time my zodiac year swung around for the third time, my ma and various aunties had all but given up on me. Only Auntie Mei, whose matchmaking powers were renowned throughout the neighbourhood, persevered. She saw me as a blemish on her otherwise pristine record. Still, she wasn’t exactly giving me much to work with: the decline in the quality of dates was evident. Ma was unimpressed. ‘No one’s forcing Auntie Mei to help,’ she said. ‘Why even bother if she’s going to bring us matches like that?’ She didn’t acknowledge that even those matches were unwilling to meet me for a second date.

‘This one is a bank teller,’ said Auntie Mei. ‘A bank teller,’ Ma sneered. ‘What prospects does a bank teller have? Slave away for a decade and you still don’t get anywhere.’ She turned to me. ‘Still, she’s about a billion times better off than you.’ For all her bluster, Ma still pulled out some cash and told me to take this one seriously, to try not to screw it up.

Taking Auntie Mei’s advice, we chose Zikawei, neutral territory, halfway between Jinyang and Xingzhuang. When we met, I learned that Wu Jiayu had left her job at the bank. She described her current work as ‘flexible’. I said mine was too. Actually, she said, she was an influencer – apparently not keen to share the same category as me. She didn’t specify what exactly her area of influence might be.

We met at a conveyor-belt sushi place – her choice. It was a new restaurant that was meant to be fun, full of chattering schoolkids. Every five plates earned you a chance to win a capsule toy from the vending machine. We were unlucky: we tried five times and didn’t win anything. This didn’t stop Wu Jiayu from taking a flurry of photos of the machine and of the little train that delivered the food. Then she busied herself with her phone.

‘So, you’re a food influencer?’ I asked. ‘It’s best not to limit yourself to one niche,’ she said. She showed me her home page on Xiaohongshu, which featured various popular locations. Most of her posts had likes in the single digits, except for one about a Western restaurant that had over a hundred – she had pinned that one to the top. ‘I’m just getting started,’ she said defensively. ‘Soon, they’ll all be super popular.’

The photos had about a 65 per cent resemblance to how she looked in person. In the photos, she could have been fresh out of university. In real life, she wore thick make-up, especially on her nose, which had a shiny patch like the Golden-Horned King in Journey to the West. I wondered what resemblance to the photos would be left minus the make-up.

But all I dared say was, ‘That’s great.’

The meal went reasonably well, mostly thanks to Wu Jiayu. She was a good talker, and it didn’t feel like she was talking just to fill awkward silence. She was comfortable talking about herself, and didn’t seem to care much what others thought of her. And she stayed clear of the standard questions you hear on an arranged date. It was clear she was also there to fulfil a family obligation. After we finished eating, she went to the bathroom and took her bag with her. I almost fell asleep waiting for her to come back and started to wonder if she had taken the subway home. Eventually she returned and took a neat little camera from her bag. ‘Are you up for helping me take a few pictures?’ she said.

I went with Wu Jiayu to the new Zikawei Library and took a few photos according to her instructions. Actually, it was more like several hundred, because we were there all afternoon. I didn’t have time to check the quality of the images. I didn’t even see the finished product on Xiaohongshu – mainly because later I couldn’t remember the long string of characters that made up her username.

I didn’t think too much of this. On previous arranged dates, I had helped move furniture or gone to pick up someone’s kids. So, when we parted at the subway station, I assumed that she would become yet another zombie lurking in the depths of my phone contacts.

A week later, to my great surprise, the zombie came back to life and asked if I was free the next day. We started meeting once a week.

Ma was both delighted and annoyed that I was staying out so long. She vented to Auntie Mei, who explained that Wu Jiayu and I were clearly sleeping together. She had seen it many a time, she said: couples who could not come to a suitable agreement and ended up becoming friends with benefits instead. Ma flew into a rage and announced that she was going to stop paying my expenses. This didn’t bother me – Wu Jiayu always reminded me to eat before we met anyway.

To make sure she was looking her best in the photos, Wu Jiayu avoided eating during our dates, and she didn’t order anything for me when we were done. We went to Dishui Lake, Home Expo, and to every road in town decorated with unseasonal flowers – places I had never been before. She wore a different fancy outfit each time: a qipao, a Japanese sailor dress, the flared trousers and tight top popular with millennials. I didn’t know if she was a hit on Xiaohongshu, but I figured she must have been reasonably satisfied with the pictures I took of her on our first date at Zikawei.

Wu Jiayu sent me the location of a place called B-Link. I looked it up: it was just across the Huangpu River, an easy trip on the Shenchuan Special Line. We agreed to meet in the evening to avoid the heat, with the usual condition that food would not be included.

She arrived before me. This was unusual. Normally she was at least ten minutes late, and would then spend another ten minutes applying her make-up in the bathroom. This gave me a chance to grab a bowl of wonton or some rice from a street vendor. This time, her outfit was retro: the sort of tracksuit students wore to school in the eighties and nineties, her hair in pigtails, a satchel over her shoulder. The thin white stripes on the sleeves and trouser legs made Wu Jiayu look thinner than usual, and she was wearing less make-up, though the shiny patch on her nose still gleamed in the light of the setting sun.

The ‘B-Link’ was a converted factory in the industrial district, and it still retained something of its original Soviet-style design. Wu Jiayu stood at the far end of a red-brick wall, looking out at a vast construction site, all neat lines, sharp angles, and overlapping layers. I wasn’t sure if she was looking at the construction or the clouds above, or perhaps just contemplating her next pose.

I walked over. ‘Which floor would you choose to live on?’ she asked.

Near where she was pointing, a large construction machine moved up and down, sliding like the glass elevators you see on the outside of shopping malls. I didn’t say anything. I was thinking about how furious Ma would be if our apartment complex once again failed to pass the referendum on installing an elevator.

‘I’ve already decided,’ said Wu Jiayu. ‘I’d live on the top floor, with the views. Closest to the Yangpu Bridge, furthest from all the bad smells of the Yangshupu River.’ The way she said it made it sound like she’d already acquired the deeds, like a price in the tens of millions was no obstacle.

We stood together for a while, until she came out of her reverie and produced her camera. We took pictures against the wall, on the lawn, and then at the designated photo spot between the two buildings, where a giant red balloon was emblazoned with the words i love b-link. Finally we took a photo at the faux street sign that said, i’m thinking of you in . . . [insert location here]. Wu Jiayu had a standard pose for these sorts of signs: she stood to the left, bent over at a right angle and leaned forward to show one side of her face. I used her favoured ratio: she took up two-thirds of the photo, the other third was scenery. Through the viewfinder, her face and the plaza behind her were tinged red like the clouds.

At one point, Wu Jiayu discovered a zebra crossing with a McDonald’s logo and immediately sat down on the M, with a pout and a V-sign. I reacted quickly, taking a few shots standing up, then a few bending down, but none of them were satisfactory. In the end, she sent me up onto the roof to take some photos from above. I didn’t have an entry card to get into the elevator of the office building, so I went through the fire exit. After a few minutes climbing up the steps, I experienced a moment of sudden uncertainty: while Wu Jiayu was pursuing fame and profit, what was I hoping to find by following her all over town? Sixty stairs and five floors later, I had come up with a couple of answers. First, it forced me out of the house, something I hadn’t done much since losing my job – in other words, a form of exercise. Second, it kept me away from Ma, with whom I had no major conflicts but still preferred to avoid. So, while you couldn’t really say that this was a meaningful use of my time, it wasn’t completely meaningless either. Maintaining a weekly habit was progress of a sort. Did this mean I could learn how to live a life of routine again, perhaps even try to return to work? Realising I was walking through an office area made me afraid to continue this line of thought. Fortunately, by this point I had arrived on the roof.

Wu Jiayu didn’t provide me with any direct instructions. Now that we had collaborated on several occasions, she seemed to trust me enough to simply sit down in the middle of the zebra crossing, exuding confidence, ignoring any side-eyes she received from passers-by. Every few seconds she switched to a new pose, positions she had clearly planned while waiting for me to climb several dozen metres above her. At this point, a third answer occurred: perhaps something deeper could develop between me and Wu Jiayu. The problem was that, like me, she was thirty-six and still living with her mother, which placed her on the lowest rung in the arranged dating marketplace. The only way out was to climb up a level, but unfortunately everyone, at every level, had the same idea. But perhaps we could find some other way out, as we were doing now, existing together somewhere beyond the family, outside the home.

Wu Jiayu stood up and dusted off her trousers, which meant I could come back down. As we wandered over to the other side of the park, we saw nearby residents out for a stroll, fans in hand, or jogging, or chatting loudly in one of the office workers’ designated smoking areas. A few were walking their dogs on the lawn that you weren’t supposed to walk on. We took a few more photos against this background. I knew for a fact that Wu Jiayu looked better in those pictures taken from a distance, but I wasn’t going to tell her that. Before long, it got dark; the lawn turned from green to black, then orange under the light of the construction site opposite.

Wu Jiayu pointed to a light in the distance. Come on, she said, let’s go over there.

We cycled away from B-Link and followed a road that ran alongside the construction site, until we arrived at Changyang Road. I realised with a jolt that I had once interned at a start-up along that road, more than a decade ago now. I wasn’t sure if the company was still there. Back then, I would take the ferry across the river in the evening and walk around for miles before setting off for home. A decade on, neither memory nor reality could really be depended upon. It was probably right ahead, visible if only we continued a bit further down the road. For a strange moment I had the sensation that I was cycling back through time; then Wu Jiayu darted off into an alley, and I had to turn back and follow her. The construction site loomed again. The abrasions of the rainy season had marked the surface of the building, and in the dim evening light it was hard to tell if it was brand new or a decaying shell on the point of collapse.

It was clearly not the first time that Wu Jiayu had cycled to the temporary accommodation building. She stepped confidently past the workers, who gave us curious glances, and towards a thicket of trees beyond. A set of stairs ran down to a riverside path. Everything was finished, neat, smooth, well proportioned, and the warm stench no longer wafted from the Yangshupu River. Downriver, the red pylons of the distant Yangpu Bridge were like two sticks of incense, glowing at each tip, illuminating everything that could see them and everything that could not.

As we walked north along the river, passing stray cats, night-time runners, fishermen with torchlights and gossiping old ladies, Wu Jiayu kept her camera in her bag. When we reached a crossroads, she stopped. On the stone bridge leading to the opposite bank, two panels of rusted sheet metal barred the way to the construction site ahead.

When I followed Wu Jiayu’s gaze, I realised that we had come to the other side of the construction site, the part we had been looking out over before – our path had taken us in a U-shaped loop. Sparks were cast down from a crane up above us, glittering waves that tumbled to the darkened ground.

Wu Jiayu pointed to the only tree on the other side of the river. ‘That’s the exact height of the third floor,’ she said.

She was standing right in front of the metal barrier, looking towards the tree. There was still no camera. In her vintage tracksuit she could have been an actor, or a time traveller from the past. What she said next only reinforced that impression.

The kitchen faced south. When they took out the extractor fan, the soot made the cat’s face even darker. After the typhoon passed, the roof was carpeted with treasure. Pairs of shorts, even some banknotes. Two generations, three. More people, less space. Grandma called, told me to go out into the street and join the demonstration, to help drum up support and carry one of those red banners that said ‘I want relocation’. But the police were already there when I arrived. Five years later, when the relocation finally happened, they really did bring out the drums for the celebrations. Shame my dad wasn’t around to hear them. Me and mum didn’t see any of that government money.

With a wave of her hand, Wu Jiayu traced the edge of the building. ‘Look, these were the Shenxin workers’ quarters, and this was Xifangziqiao, and next to it . . .’

I no longer felt like I was just there to take photographs or provide her with a service. Now our relationship felt more like that of host and guest. But again, I had the vague sense that I had been here before.

Xifangzhiqiao – Bridge of the West. And next to that, was it Dongfangzhiqiao? I asked. Bridge of the East?

Not zhiqiao, she corrected me, ziqiao. The zi of child, or banknote.

When I was an intern, I used to go for walks after work to avoid the evening rush. Some of the buildings had been demolished, others had been emptied out, leaving nothing but concrete husks. After nine o’clock, legs emerged from the cracks in those empty buildings – slender ones, fleshy ones, all lined up against the wall. They smoked, chatted to each other, chatted to passers-by, and their words brought a chill to the evening breeze. I kept my gaze low, listening to the conversations, the accents, never daring to look up. I remember a pair of mauve tights that stood out from the row of black and fishnet; they made the legs look fuller, curved like an aubergine. At that moment, the mauve tights stepped forwards, and a hand reached out to cover my trouser pocket, pressing down hard just as a motorbike roared past. When I came to my senses, the hand was gone, and my phone was still in my pocket. I gave a nod of thanks.

‘Five hundred,’ said mauve tights. ‘What do you say?’

I didn’t answer.

‘I bet your phone cost quite a bit,’ she said.

That Motorola had cost me 1,500 yuan, and she had helped me keep it. So I figured I was saving money, even if I did pay her. We agreed on 300, and I went with her. The way was long and winding – amber street lights, black roads, mauve tights. We finally arrived at a row of cramped slum housing. A single room, no light, no fan, only a cool breeze blowing in off the river carrying a foul smell. In the dark, her body was plumper than it had seemed outside, but surprisingly nimble. Perhaps she was just trying to get it done quickly. She didn’t walk me back when we were done. In something of a trance, I wandered for a long time, unable to find my way out of the maze. When, at last, I ended up back where I started, I saw her climbing onto the back of a motorbike. The bike carried mauve tights away, probably back to their original position, their original set-up, like a game restarting, ready for the next passer-by. Following the fumes of the motorbike, I rushed out of the maze, pausing at the metal gate to glance up at the street sign, the end point of the game: dongfangzhiqiao, the bridge of the east. The world of Shanghai, ‘the Pearl of the East’, felt very far removed from
that place.

Now, many years later, the riddle was solved. It wasn’t ‘Dongfang-zhiqiao’ but ‘Dong-Fangziqiao’: it was bordered by the river, and divided into an east, Dong-Fangziqiao, and a west, Xi-Fangziqiao. I must have misread that one character on the sign, or misremembered. Not that it mattered, because now everything would be new, and this place could be named anything. They could come up with some kind of justification for any old name – just look at the meaningless wording on the advert above the construction site: brilliant riverside, where past and future converge. I had no choice but to believe it.

Wu Jiayu and I walked a long way along the Yangshupu River that evening. Each time the two incense sticks of the Yangpu Bridge loomed up before us, she turned around and we doubled back, like two fish trapped in a weir. When we were tired from all the walking, Wu Jiayu suggested we sit down by some outdoor fitness equipment. She looked through the photos, enlarging each one, as if checking for a particular element. She didn’t speak for a while – she never felt the need to fill silences. Though the length of this particular silence made me wonder if I should leave her to it. When she did finish, she stood up, dusted herself off, and said, ‘Let’s go back.’ Standard procedure: we each rented a share-bike, and set off towards the subway station that offered the most convenient route home.

At the Jiangpu Park intersection, I watched her lock the bike and head into the station. She disappeared down one hole, and then reappeared from another, a dozen metres away, just a few seconds later.

‘Wait, are you up for helping me take a few pictures down by the river?’ she called, with the exact same tone as when she first asked me.

Perhaps because of that night’s episode, I decided to take the ferry home when we were done with the photos. The evening air was cool, and the reflections gleamed in the water – neither the air nor the water had changed with the years.

Ma was not pleased. She followed me to my room and demanded that I tell her exactly where I stood with Wu Jiayu. Since she wasn’t leaving, I decided to provoke her. ‘We’re discussing living arrangements,’ I told her. ‘What are you talking about?’ she said, alarmed. ‘Does this mean you’re paying for a house, or she is?’ ‘It’s an old house we’ve been discussing,’ I said. ‘One that’s already been knocked down.’ A sigh of relief. ‘Oh, so she took you back to the place where she grew up – does that mean you’re serious?’ I picked up my towel and went into the bathroom without replying.

I came out of the shower to a message from Wu Jiayu, forwarded from her Xiaohongshu account. It was the last picture we had taken that night: her and the Yangpu Bridge, composed as she’d instructed. She was a small figure, lit from behind, her face indistinct. In the background, the two incense sticks of the bridge, crimson, solemn, indifferent to the blazing headlights that moved between them. The second image was a copy of an old photo. A small figure, lit from behind so her face was indistinct, the pylons of the bridge – still under construction – rising behind her. The surface of the river was calm, and the sky was broad. In the bottom-right corner, red numbers: 1992.8. It was that same summer.

It was a new post, not yet attracting any interest, but pinned to the top of her profile. The title was ‘Me and Me’.

Without hesitation, I pressed the red heart. Now I had her username, I spent several hours going through every single one of her posts, including the ones that featured my photography, and though none of them really captured what she looked like in real life, I gave each one a red heart.

Before I went to sleep, I wrote out a new message. Where are you going next weekend?

As I hit send, it felt like I had left my room behind and was standing with Wu Jiayu, together in the midnight street.

    "text": "I’ve never worked in this flat. I’ve done the dishes – there is no dishwasher or freezer, but there is a compact fridge, which I’ve heard groaning when the night is thin and I can’t sleep and Leo sleeps – and I’ve done the washing. I’ve scrubbed down the walls of the white-tiled bathroom, which some would say looks like the lavatory of a psychiatric hospital, but I quite like it. Though work-work – I’ve never once sat down to do that here.

I think a lot about my acts around the house. If I do the dishes, does it mean I am starting a pattern that will be hard to break later? If I do the shopping, will that be mine to do next week and the week after that? People don’t talk about these things when they move in together. We haven’t. They – meaning we – just do things as they come. Colette once said the most important thing in a relationship is to have good manners and to treat each other as though you don’t live together.

We wake up. Leo makes coffee on the stove. We drink it in the front room by the large open window that is also a door, so that we’re inside and outside at the same time. It’s warm enough for that, but only just. Then Leo starts working at the dining table that overlooks the terrace, though he sits facing the wall. I wouldn’t do that if I were working. I would face the swaying tops of the trees visible through a narrow interstice in the concrete wall. You can’t see the water below from there, but something about the manner of the trees gives it away. I think Leo could work facing anything: work is a switch he turns on, which has sometimes seemed to me threatening. He can work there, face against the wall, for five hours straight. He hardly moves. We break for lunch if I’m there, and usually I am, and then he continues until the evening, at which point I will have done the shopping.

 

–

 

Leo’s being here means many things to me, and one of them is that I want to fuck during the day. This is not a system I can impose. In the face of Leo’s concentration, my time, whether spent idling on the sofa or not, feels stolen. The thing is – or another thing is – that if I were to sit down and work here at the dining table beside Leo, we’d be facing each other. That’s not a way I can work. I could go to the library, hauling all my things there and back, but I did that for years. I can’t muster even the idea of it. I lie down on the floor. I stand back up, looking out the interstice in the wall. I go stand in the kitchen. Everything has been cleaned already; there is nothing to clean here. Leo is a messy chef. He cuts vegetables in a way that, if they’re peppers, pips are strewn all over the place, and if they’re tomatoes, juice bleeds thin and coagulated down the counter.

For a moment I’m happy that he’s not here today but away at some conference in Liverpool. The boy, though, is here. I look at him across the room, the top of his head is visible over the back of the sofa. From here it could be a grown person’s head, though he’s only three. The boy likes looking through the interstice too. Sometimes a heron passes, seen as through a pair of rectangular binoculars. I think of the time I saw a hammer lying by the coffee machine in my mum’s kitchen, and all the daycare children were sitting with their soft skulls eating cut fruit from little flower plates. I wonder when skulls reach their full size, and just then the boy turns as though registering the discomfort of my thinking.

 

the boy: Where’s daddy?

me: At the conference, remember?

the boy: Right.

me: But that’s okay. We can take the train just fine on our own, can’t we?

 

He’s looking at me directly now, his eyes a colour I can’t name. I feel a blend of care and worry swell in my chest. I think of soil and cut straw. I swallow. The boy directs his eyes at the interstice again. I wonder what he will look like when he’s five, ten, twenty.

 

me: Do you like the flat?

 

I regret the question immediately. The boy turns his head and looks at me. I look at the boy. We blink.

 

the boy: I like the windows that are also doors.

 

This pleases me.

On the platform the boy’s hand is warm in mine, a little clammy. He goes in front and picks two seats by the window. He knows his way around the carriage, or carriages like it. I sit down across from him and watch him watching trees flick past. His eyes are lighter than his father’s, the pupils noticeably small. They dart from point to point. I don’t want him to feel observed – I look away.

How can we be equals, I think. How can I be older, earn his respect, but also have him not loathe me. I wonder if he’s hungry, but perhaps by not asking he will see me as more of an equal. Would he tell me if he were, hungry? I have a banana in my bag, but thinking about it makes me feel guilty, like I’m treating the child as an animal. A feeling of abandonment rushes through me. How could Leo have me take this trip on my own when it’s the first time I go there? Is everything you do in a child’s life about reacting, solving sudden logistical hurdles in sequence? The boy sneezes, surprising himself. He smiles at me, watery eyes. He has one crooked tooth in front of the other like a toe poking out of a sock.

He walks ahead on a gravel path that turns into pavement. There aren’t any birds in the trees, which have dark brown leaves, unseasonably still attached. The boy pretend-whistles. I can’t whistle either and I think that I love him. Will this feeling fester? I wonder. He stops in front of the door of number six, whose number – font, size, placement – suggests precisely door number 6, like in some game show. Did I not dream this once, walking a tapering path with a small boy, opening doors?

I feel my stomach turn, picturing a leaden figure inside, rows of family and individual portraits on walls, contemptible flowery dresses and chins on folded hands. With his hand already pressed to the door, which has neither knob nor handle, the boy peers over his shoulder at me, his flat palm seemingly saying: help, I can’t get in. He looks at me. I signal for him to wait, I don’t know how, but it works. I think of trees communicating below ground through spidery strings.

The boy waits, nothing on him budges, the hand placed flat against door number six says: this is the door I want. Some people have a calm about them. Do I? Probably not these days, an edge of tension comes with not working, a certain lethargy. I walk up near the boy. Be the one who knows, I think, or at least the one who is calm about not knowing. I knock on the door. For a moment nothing, but a thick nothing. Then a soft rustling, like a chiffon shawl being pulled through a keyhole. The boy removes his hand from the door and folds it into mine. It’s warm, small, a little clammy still. Is he taking care of me, or is he nervous? We wait. The knocks have activated movement inside, which we listen to.

The woman has put out biscuits that I’m trying not to judge. Who would buy these dry, flavourless lumps of flour and oil, I think, and I think of my grandmother, who might have when she was alive. I think of death. The air in the place is dense and I think that sitting down was a mistake. Did I ask if I could, or did she direct me to this seat. I already can’t remember. There’s a lot of saliva in my mouth. My hands feel like dry, itchy gloves. My eyes are dry too, and when I blink they smudge up. I know her nails from photos. They’re long and ladylike, the kind that would try to scratch a sticker off the back of a CD case. I take some pride in my lack of ladylikeness. It’s a thick felt vest I can put on. Wearing dresses makes me feel like a woman, which I am, but I prefer not to think about that whenever I move my legs. To have long nails . . .

The boy sips his lemonade or whatever she’s poured in his little plastic cup. From the wet look in his eyes it’s something fizzy. My tendency to judge is something that’s developed out of an aversion to my own childhood, or the middle part, the beginning was good. We lived by a lake then and had a nanny, it was my brief Fleur Jaeggy period. It meant my parents were earning money and wanted us in or near the house rather than sending us off to state-run institutions, the worst in the country, that would later break us. You can be such a snob, Leo told me once. This did not hurt me, because I knew it’s not my soul that is. It’s much more surface level than that, more recent.

She hasn’t looked at me yet, and by not looking she’s looking piercingly. I let her not look which means not looking at her either. It’s difficult to keep finding new places to rest my eyes. I don’t want to look at what’s on the walls. I want to not know. I want to not see the wiry lamp in the ceiling that casts a web-like reflection on the table between us, but now I’ve seen it. I want to not see the cumbersome piece of Edwardian furniture behind her with a fruit bowl holding just one blighted orange, but now I’ve seen it. I want to not see the long, painted fingernails tuck a tuft of hair behind a fleshy ear. Is anyone going to speak? I think. I look at the boy, who is in his childhood home. I look to my right at the garden door. I think of a board with many latches, unilateral latches, which my brother made for his son because he loves latches, opening things, turning keys inside locks, clasping. This is what some fathers do for their sons. The boy looks at me, as if to ask what I’m doing here, but then speaks:

 

the boy: The sideways door in Mara’s flat is a window.

the fingernailed woman: –

me: –

the fingernailed woman: Biscuit?

 

I remember that I love him. We are something too – it’s lesser, but we are it. The woman hands me the plate of biscuits; this is her power. The boy crawls down from his stool and walks over to me. He takes a biscuit, puts the plate on the table where it was. I look at the woman for the first time, worried about the boy’s gesture. Then he crawls onto my thighs, something he’s never done before – we’ve been so separate in the flat.

 

the boy: Here.

me: –

the fingernailed woman: –

the boy: (to convince me) They’re good.

 

It would be mean not to touch him. Sitting there with a baby animal on my lap. I put a hand on his side not to support him in his seat so much as to indicate to him that there is support there if he needs it. Her eyes are on us. Now it looks like we’re this intimate all the time, which we’re not, have never been. Maybe it was the train journey. Maybe it’s the look on my face. What do I look like? Something smells like basement. It’s the house. I stroke the boy’s hair with a flat hand, the way you feed a horse.

Women with long fingernails want children before thirty-five, I think. Women with short fingernails don’t know. They’ve had a sustained tomboy period as children that they never grew out of and which gradually took the shape of a suspicion about motherhood and even coupledom. Women with long fingernails like flowery dresses; women with short fingernails dress monochrome. Women with long fingernails don’t want anal. Women with short fingernails like it when men come on their backs. Women with short fingernails have seen the scared eyes of men when they come, seen in their eyes, the moment they do, flashing images of their future children walking down corridors. I blink hard to stop my thoughts. The boy is on me. I look at her looking at the boy, I no longer care where she looks. His little cup is empty; he’s holding it upside down above his face to catch a final drop. She picks up her phone – the case shows a floral painting, a Monet or something stupid like that, probably bought in the V & A.

On the way back I take the seat facing away from the direction of travel, though I know it will make me a bit sick. The flat is dark and the skylight in the kitchen is dark. I will never work in this flat, I can see that now. No word from Leo since he messaged asking if his red notebook was on the desk. It wasn’t. I’ve only ever seen him with blue notebooks, always the same kind. Am I supposed to see that as a seed he’s planting, wanting to plant concern about some notebook, in me? I turn on the faucet. I drink from it. I look at the water. I turn it off. I go and sit on the dining table, because I can. I turn on the TV. Hanif Kureishi is saying that liberalism is not strong enough to handle powerful individuals who truly want something. I turn off the TV. I go and lie on the bed. I sit up and look out at the lamps of the opposing building that glow in the windows like blurred traffic lights.

The building is loud in my head, maybe it’s the silence, the gurgling pipes and even the carpet. I think of the tank above my head that holds the tub water. I was told when moving in that you shouldn’t drink from the sink in the bathroom as the water comes directly from the tank. Did I one night climb a four-rung steel ladder to see the tank for myself, or did I dream it? I stand up. I go to the sitting room to throw my phone at the sofa. I lie down where it lands, remove it from beneath me, hold it near my heart.

When I open my eyes the phone is pinging on the floor. There’s a text from the fingernailed woman. Can I pick up the boy from nursery today? He is ill. Leo is not picking up his phone, and she’s just about to chair a meeting. I text her yes. She tells me where to find the spare key. I leave the flat. I don’t shower.

 

–

 

The boy is standing outside the nursery in the pouring rain. There is a nursery worker by his side. I don’t know what to call her – where I’m from pedagogue is the word, but I think that’s derogatory in this country.

 

the boy: You’re late.

me: I’m here now.

the boy: Where are we going?

me: To the flat, I thought. Or where do you want to go?

 

We go to the station. It’s local in the way of bus stations. Something about ratios and colours of cladding. We board a train. We share yesterday’s banana. Still no word from Leo. The only voice answering me here is the boy. He lifts his chin about two finger widths to look at something out the window. I eat my share of the fruit in silence.

At Kings Cross, we exit the train and board another. The train stops too many times. The boy draws. It is important to not merely be absorbed into his life, that wouldn’t be right. The landscape changes. I grew up in a country with no mountains, this is a lot for me. My stomach responds in a way that feels like hunger but more of a stabbing. The train doors swoosh open. Empty purple platform. Dusk. I sit facing the swaying tops of trees that are visible through the narrowing space between the doors. Is there a lake nearby? I hear the boy swallow. Our heads lean against the window.

    "text": "My mother was always encouraging me to take up a sport, something I could do in my spare time that would be good for my health. It was a chance to get a bit sweaty, she said, to relieve some stress, and if I learned a sport now I’d have a skill for life. Why not give it a go? After thinking it over, I decided swimming might be fun. I imagined myself gliding through the water like a turtle, stopping to float whenever I wanted. And I thought that girls’ faces looked so lovely and white in blue water.

There weren’t many swimming pools in the city when I was in primary school. Aside from the enormous pool at the Workers’ Cultural Palace, I knew of only one other. It was just across the road from where we lived, down a narrow alley busy with tricycle trucks and opposite a school for children with special needs. The sign outside said swimming pool, but if you gave a driver the address, you had to say ‘Hai Shan Bath House’, because people mostly went there to bathe or shower. Swimming was quite expensive whereas a body scrub was more affordable. We lived in an old building, which was hard to keep warm, and in the winter, it was a hassle for the three of us to take showers. The shower attachment was a late addition, which meant you had to hold it up the entire time, and since neither the water nor the room were heated, whenever you took a shower, you risked catching a cold. My father would have sooner died than go to the public baths – he was too shy to take his clothes off in public – so I started going with my mother. It was less stressful that way. And naturally, we went to Hai Shan Swimming Pool.

The second time we went, the woman at the front desk talked my mother into buying more than just a shower. You’d be better off with an all-inclusive ticket. It covers everything: shower, scrub and swim. It’s much better value. She glanced down at me. Looks like your daughter could use some swimming lessons. I’m not sure what she saw in me. I was more tanned back then; perhaps she meant I should spend more time in the water.

My mother and I were very excited. We went straight to Bai Hua Yuan, a little wholesale market around the corner, and bought two swimming costumes, two pairs of goggles, and a swimming float for me. The seller there was persuasive too. If you buy an inflatable ring, she’ll never learn to swim! He turned to me. Here, take this. I took the swimming float. You have to stretch out your legs and kick them up and down like this. He threw away the snack he was holding, malatang in a plastic bag, to show me what to do. When you get in the water, hold it like this. Imagine you’re in trouble, and this float is a piece of decking that’s fallen off a boat. My mother had no time for this, but I got really into it, listening closely as he continued, his voice getting louder and louder. Imagine there’s a shark chasing you and a big wave right behind. You can see the beach just ahead. You hold on tight, and go for it. When you hit the shore, lie down on the float like this, like it’s a mattress . . . My mother cut in. I’ll give you ten yuan tops, and that’s it. And just like that, he turned away, and I never got to hear the end of the story.

When we got home, I pestered my mother. When can we go swimming? At first it looked promising. I’ll take you tomorrow after work, she said. But the next day, she didn’t come home after work. There was a drinks party, and then another one the next day, and the day after that. When she did come home, late at night, bleary-eyed and muddled, she stamped loudly in the corridor to activate the light and banged on the door with the heel of her shoe. My dad just accepted it, but I was furious. She saw the swimming float on the bed in my room and lay down on it, mumbling. Where are you? Come and sit next to your mum. I asked why she’d taken her shoes off. She said she’d cut her foot on the way home. There was broken glass on the ground. I didn’t see it. I moved closer and looked at her right foot. There was a bright red gash near her big toe. Without a word, my father went to fetch some sterilising wipes. When he returned, I stood before them with my head down, clenched my fists, and prepared what I was going to say. I took a deep breath and pushed my shoulders back. My mother finally noticed me. Oh, I’m lying on your float. I stared at her. When are we going swimming? Tell me exactly which day. She grinned. It’s up to you. I took another deep breath. Tomorrow. You won’t be working. It’s a Saturday.

My parents looked at each other. I’ve cut my foot, my mother said. I won’t be able to go in the water. I stood my ground. Two days ago, your foot was fine. Yesterday, your foot was fine. I think you did this on purpose. My father stayed quiet, just watching. In the silence that followed, reason slowly sided with my mother: she had an injury, even taking a shower would be difficult; several hours soaking in a pool full of disinfectant was out of the question. But at the time, I was indignant. Let your father take you, she suggested. He refused immediately – it would mean baring his pale upper arms. I didn’t want that either. I hung my head again, and as planned began to cry. It worked. My mother must still have been drunk, or else she would never have promised. When my mother drank, we were equals. Even so, she seemed reluctant. She grasped my hands and tried to make me touch her foot, but I pulled away. She sighed. Do we really have to go?

My father said she spoiled me, but it wasn’t like he was going to do anything about it. For him, Saturday was set in stone: it was his gaming day, spent, from breakfast until dinner, in front of the computer. The next day, my mother, having promised to take me swimming, wrapped a piece of plastic around her toe, and secured it with a rubber band. We crossed the road with our new kit and walked into Hai Shan Swimming Pool. Although, as I said, I’d been there twice before, both times it was just to the showers. I’d never been further. Today I was going all the way inside. In the changing room, putting on my swimming costume, I felt a cut above everyone else. I treated the brand new swimming costume like I used to treat my ballet leotard when I was younger. I took it out of the locker and put it on slowly. A little girl watched me very intently and asked her mother what I was wearing and why. The swimming costume was dark blue, with a little skirt and a yellow duck on the front. It was a bit big for me, and the straps kept slipping off my shoulders, so I had to straighten up and walk with the posture of a ballet dancer, wearing the matching dark-blue swimming cap that showed off my big forehead. Meanwhile, my mother attended to her toe: the elastic band was too tight and blood wasn’t getting to the toe, which was beginning to go white.

We walked past the steaming showers, through the huge relaxation hall with the lights switched off, and all the way down a long, narrow corridor towards a light at the far end. A middle-aged woman in short sleeves and shorts sat on a stool checking tickets. She checked our wristbands. Go through the foot pool. The swimming pool is just around the corner. There aren’t many swimmers today. I nodded blankly. My feet finally came out of the slippers and the feeling when they touched the white tiles was exhilarating. My mother went first and paddled through the ankle-deep footbath of disinfectant. As I held her arm in support, I noticed some water slip inside the plastic around her toe. The middle-aged woman had sharp eyes. What’s the matter? Something wrong with your foot? My mother had been waiting for someone to ask so she could embarrass me. I went red as she explained. Well, you’re here now, the middle-aged woman said. Might as well let her do what she wants! I reasoned that if no one came to swim, the woman would have nothing to show for having sat there all day. She waved us past and my mother led me around the corner. A bright blue world came into view. The water was calm.

Holding the float, I stepped onto the ladder and climbed down into the water. My mother had gone first and was waiting for me. I managed to get into the pool, but as soon as she let go of me, I started screaming. At the time I was about 1.3 metres tall, and even on tiptoes I could only just keep my head above water; the moment my feet were flat on the floor, water went up my nose, in my ears, gushing at me from every direction. The float was no use at all. My mother hauled me up a few times and I hung from her body like a sloth from a tree, cold and frightened. When I gazed over at the deep end, the pool seemed to go on forever. The lifeguard, who had a toned upper body and visible ribs, stood at the side of the pool watching me for ages, and then said to my mother, Your daughter could choke on all that water. My mother scowled back. And it’s your job to save her life. I want her to know what it feels like to be in the water. The lifeguard said, I think she’s felt enough. I would stop before it’s too late. My mother gave up on me and dipped down into the water. She hadn’t gone swimming for a long time, and she wanted to enjoy herself. It was as if the cut on her foot had transferred to me; I felt that my whole body was covered in cuts that were aggravated by the water. The lifeguard told her to let me swim in the little pool upstairs, where the water was shallower. We were both surprised to learn that there was a children’s pool. Why hadn’t they told us earlier? I climbed out, shivering with cold, while my mother glided back and forth like a mud loach, a girlish smile on her face as she waved at me. Go upstairs and practise. You’ll only hold me back here.

There were two small pools upstairs. And whichever way I looked at them, they were for soaking, not swimming. The water wasn’t blue, it was hot and there was sand at the bottom. I stepped into the smaller one. Standing up, the water just reached my calves. I tried to float in the water, but the tiles on the bottom kept sticking to my legs. Even without the float, it would have taken some effort to drown. While I was trying to practise, I heard a few people enter the downstairs pool. I could hear my mother laughing as she chatted with a group of men and women who had arrived together, and were about to race each other from one end of the pool to the other. The lifeguard shouted, Go! He seemed to be using a stopwatch. My little pool felt strange and quiet. I tried kicking the water a couple of times, and it sounded all right, but when I stopped splashing, there was no shark, no big wave. I was already on the beach, and it didn’t matter how I swam because I was stranded.

I leaned against the upstairs railing and looked down. A supple figure appeared in the vast blue swimming pool; it moved like a tadpole, feet flickering, legs moving as one, like a single tail. She swam to the far end of the pool, then almost without stopping, turned and swam back, leaving my mother and the others half a length behind her. I saw the lifeguard bring her a white bath towel, and I saw her nimbly pull herself onto the side of the pool, and sit there draped in the towel, casually kicking her dainty white feet in the water. My mother wiped water from her face, moved her goggles up to her forehead, and asked, How old are you? She said that she was eleven. I recognise you, Auntie, she added. Li Wu and I are classmates. My mother sat down next to her, and said, What a coincidence! My daughter’s here too. What’s your name? She should learn from you how to swim. She said that her name was Yang Yang. Before I could dodge out of sight, my mother raised her hand and pointed in my direction, as though blindly firing a gun. I stayed exactly where I was, though part of me fell to the ground as the gun fired. Li Wu’s a lost cause, my mother said. She’s in the shallow pool. Why don’t you go and find her? I waved stiffly down at Yang Yang. She looked up at me. She already had girlish curves, and as she stood up, drops of water rolled over the muscles on her leg. She laughed, Pshht. Her eyes were jet-black and kind, her eyebrows thick, almost meeting in the middle. She looked as if she had been born knowing how to swim, as if she had mastered sword fighting and hunting too. After she had done a few stretches at the side of the pool, she said goodbye to my mother and went to get changed.

Outside, after my mother and I had fastened our padded jackets, she looped a scarf several times around my neck and mouth. Did you know that your straps were slipping down your arms when you were standing at the railing? And when you saw your classmate, you didn’t say anything, you just did a silly smile, like the children at the special school across the road. I shook my head. It wasn’t a silly smile, I said. I was being sarcastic. My words were muffled by the scarf. Why? asked my mother. I thought about it as we walked along. We were almost home when I spoke again, my voice still muffled. It was a good thing she didn’t come upstairs. My sarcasm might have put her off. My mother looked at me quizzically, only then thinking to ask what it was like upstairs. How was the water? I pulled the scarf down and let out a long breath. The inside of my scarf was wet through and dotted with tiny crystals of ice. It was pretty deep, I said. I’m glad I had the float. And I can float now.

The day after we went to Hai Shan Swimming Pool, the cut on my mother’s foot was inflamed and very swollen. She tried to blame it on me, but I pushed back. You didn’t have to stay in the water so long. We ignored each other for a few days, and I stopped thinking about swimming; instead, it was Yang Yang in her swimming costume, the curves of her body, that kept appearing in my mind.

She’d already caught my attention at school. There was an arts academy in the city, and every year they would visit several primary schools looking for students with potential. The head teacher of the academy was a square-faced young man with sunglasses. He came in, glasses on, took a few steps in his leather shoes, then stopped, as if he were standing in a spotlight onstage, and looked at us all with disdain. The time I was part of the group selected for his consideration, I was in the front row. I held my shoulders so far back that they hurt, and when the man walked past, I gave a big smile, revealing my crooked canines. He raised an eyebrow, and moved on. I wished afterwards that I had chosen to look more serious. But Yang Yang had smiled too. She was standing behind me, and I could see her in the mirror. The man looked at her for a long time, and I heard him saying to himself, trembling with joy, Oh, please let me train you.

My mother took some time off work to recover. One day, when she woke up, I was already home from school, facing our old-style window frames with the brass fittings, crying, constantly wiping my tears across my temples, each wipe leaving a mark. She asked me what the matter was, and when I told her, she was quick to explain that I wasn’t selected because my posture wasn’t good enough. What’s good posture? I asked. She sat up in bed, holding her solid upper body straight, head up, chest open, eyes straight ahead, with a rigid smile, and said, See, this is good posture. I looked at her. Yang Yang didn’t look like that, she was very natural, I said. Who is Yang Yang? The girl at the swimming pool? my mother asked. Yes, I said, and went to sit on the edge of the bed by her legs, resting my head on her chest. I didn’t want to talk any more.

I decided to go to Hai Shan Swimming Pool the following Saturday on my own. My mother packed my bag, put her old PHS phone in my jacket pocket, and told me to call when I got there. She gave me three hours, after which I had to be home. My father tried to bargain with her. How about two hours? Two hours is enough for her to go swimming. He wanted to walk me there, but my mother and I wouldn’t let him, though we conceded that he could come and pick me up in three hours’ time. The woman checking tickets to the swimming pool wasn’t too concerned when she saw me on my own. Her eyes lit up. You’re back! How’s your mum’s foot? It’s much better, I said, almost following it up with, The family’s all fine. Like a long-lost auntie, she tucked some loose hair from around my temples into my swimming cap, and asked if I’d come to meet my friend, who she said was already inside. My mind shuddered as my subconscious nagged at me to sneak away. Yang Yang wasn’t exactly a friend. Does she swim on her own too? I asked the auntie, who seemed delighted to have someone to chat with, even a child. I stood in the shallow footbath, listening as she talked, disinfecting my feet for a long time. I learned that Yang Yang came swimming every Saturday. The lifeguard had been her teacher, but she didn’t need a coach any more – it was a hobby, one she was very good at. The lifeguard kept encouraging her to pursue it as a career, but Yang Yang’s parents didn’t agree. I thought I knew why: no one who knew how brightly she shone outside the swimming pool would agree. There were too many adults competing to train her. I figured that having too many choices must also be a problem.

As soon as I turned the corner, I saw her. She was swimming across the blue sea, the only person in the entire swimming pool. The lifeguard wasn’t there that day, and the height of the building, the smell of the chlorine and the lines she drew in the water made me feel lonely. I didn’t call out to her, just carried my float upstairs. I soaked silently in the little pool, listening to the sound of the water splashing downstairs. I pictured myself, aged five or six, going to the public baths with my mother for the first time, and standing under the steaming shower, surrounded by women chatting. Everything they said echoed, lulling me into a trance. I felt that no one would ever understand that sensation of being part of the world, and at the same time, being able to withdraw from it. Then I heard someone call my name. Li Wu! By the time I saw that it was Yang Yang, she was right in front of me. I stood up with a lot of splashing, and felt the warmth sink from my whole body down to my calves, to water level. Yang Yang looked down at her feet, then at me. Why don’t you come and swim in the pool? She stepped into the water with me, warming her feet while she sat on the edge, which made me realise that maybe it was for soaking your feet. I didn’t say anything. If you stay up here, you’ll never learn, she said. I don’t want to learn, I said. I only came for a shower. As soon as I said it, I regretted it. She looked at me and smiled. But you brought the float.

How about I teach you, starting with the basics? Yang Yang looked at me, her head tilted to one side. I looked away and when I looked back, Yang Yang had quietly stolen my float. Behind me, I heard the patter of her feet as she ran down the stairs and jumped into the swimming pool. I chased after her, leaning forwards on the poolside and shouted at her across the water. What are you doing? Yang Yang spat out a mouthful of water, and grinned. Come and get it. I looked at the pale pink board floating beside her. She swam back towards me, took a deep breath, and put her head underwater. I watched as her slender body spread out in the water, then floated up to the surface, and swayed gently, as if it was lighter than the float. Come and try. I turned around and started to climb down the ladder into the pool. I felt her cold fingertips on my calves. Yang Yang put her arms around my waist. Imagine that everything around you is air. The water is like air.

I wanted to break free from her, but I didn’t dare. She was a head taller than me and could stand up in the water and breathe easily, which I couldn’t. But I couldn’t wrap myself around her either, as I had with my mother. I wished I had never got in the pool. In the water, I couldn’t be sarcastic, that most basic form of self-defence. Yang Yang gave me orders, Put your hands on the edge. Hold the edge. Let go. Then she disappeared. I thrashed about in a panic. I swallowed some water and almost choked, but found I was rising. Yang Yang issued another order, Lift your feet off the ground. Lift your feet up, you won’t fall down. You’ll just float.

In the water that she said was like air, I felt a freedom that was almost like losing consciousness. As soon as my feet left the bottom of the pool, it was as if my legs were no longer mine; they drifted, as if they belonged to one universe, and I was in another. I couldn’t open my mouth, because it would still let in water, but I could hear what Yang Yang was saying. I was lighter than I had ever been before. I curled up, brought my legs to my chest, and pressed my toes against the tiles. Do you think I’m stupid? I asked. She shook her head. You’re not stupid, you just wouldn’t let go. Swimming is the best way of letting go, she said, That’s why I come. It’s the only time I can spread out my arms and legs, and really be myself.

I thought about this for a moment. It’s not the same for me, I said. I always have to tell myself to stand up straight or put on a smile. You shine wherever you are. Even when you don’t feel yourself, when you let go, there are people who love you. I couldn’t be more different. She watched me intently, and after a long time, she smiled again. Li Wu, look at me. Instead of looking at her face, I had been watching her legs changing shape in the water. The light refracting in the water kept distorting them. There were some blurry marks on her leg. I looked closer, thinking I must be mistaken, and she cooperatively raised the leg. My leg was on fire. The year before last, there was a fire in the Wufu community. I was home when it happened. I ran down the hallway, but I wasn’t fast enough, my leg got burned, and I fell. When I was taken to hospital my leg was much worse than this. I said that she was brave to bare her legs in public. I can’t hide it, she said. It’s better in the water, because people only see it through the splashing water as I swim, and splashes always look good. I looked her in the eye and said, You’re the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen. Yang Yang stood still for a moment, then jumped into the water again, and we stood there facing each other. If she hadn’t done that, I wouldn’t have realised that I was standing up in the water. When she came forward to hug me, the buoyancy of the water made it feel unreal, as though we had found one another in a dream.

My father came to collect me on time. Yang Yang didn’t get out of the pool with me, and I was reluctant to leave. I watched as she continued to swim up and down, then went to the shower room by myself to rinse off the chlorine. By the time I met my father, I was fully armed. He asked me on the way home if I’d got the basics. I said that I had, and that I wanted to come again every day of the week. He wasn’t expecting that, and walked ahead without a word, his bulky body in a red down jacket, carrying my pink shower bag. That was the extent of our conversation. When we got home, my mother was still in bed, watching TV. She turned down the volume, and kissed my pink face when I walked over to her. You look so much better after some exercise, she said.

For a while, when I walked past the arts academy, I would see Yang Yang’s photograph hanging at the front of the building. In time though, the picture, which showed her dressed in a purple tulle skirt, disappeared like an illusion. Despite this, I continued to see her all over the city. I would mention this while chatting with my mother, and she would always ask, Who’s Yang Yang? She hadn’t yet been back to the swimming pool; she was waiting for her foot to heal. Yang Yang’s the girl at the swimming pool, I said. The last time you were there you raced with her, remember, and she beat you. My mother frowned. I thought you two didn’t get along, she said. We’re friends, I said. We don’t say hello at school, we just smile when we see each other, but in the swimming pool, she’s like my shadow. My mother seemed pleased. I was worried about you, always being on your own, she said. She’s teaching me how to swim, and I keep her company – we both win. Besides, life is hard and good friends are few. My mother slapped the back of my head. Don’t say that life is hard in front of me. I have a harder life and fewer friends than you. I’m still here.

Where we live, summer passes quickly, and autumn even faster, but winter is long and slow. As the trees began to lose their leaves, ice started forming in the puddles on the dirt road in front of Hai Shan Swimming Pool. Yang Yang and I met at the pool every Saturday come rain or shine. I wasn’t a particularly good student, and she stopped trying to push me. Instead, we spent most of our time just floating in the water, drifting and talking. One day, Yang Yang arrived late. When she came through the door, my head was underwater while I practised holding my breath. I had been trying to open my eyes in the water without goggles, as Yang Yang did with ease, and I could just about manage it, but it was different for me: when I opened my eyes, I started seeing things, and it terrified me. Yang Yang came over and stood by my head at the poolside. I let out the breath I’d been holding, raised my head above water. She was just squatting there, watching me. Torturing yourself? she asked. You’re so late, I said. We’re moving, she said. They won’t let me come any more. I wanted to get out of the pool, to talk to her, but she said not to worry. There was a loud noise as she jumped in, splashing water all over my face. It was a different Yang Yang from usual, her back to the side of the pool, standing there calmly, her face pale, every hair of her eyebrows clearly visible. She whipped off her swimming cap with one hand and revealed a new boyish haircut. It was short and neat, and she used her wet fingers to smooth a stray hair on her forehead. Her hair parted naturally, as though styled with gel. A few wisps hung loose. She said, I have to go to Harbin.

Yang Yang looked at me without moving at all, her eyes as open as her shoulders. I thought for a while. It’ll be fine. Big cities are more fun, I said. Why are you so concerned about fun? she said. It’ll never be like this again: you and me in this big pool, swimming, doing whatever we like. I swallowed a couple of times. Some water had gone up my nose and was now in my throat. I couldn’t stop it from slipping down inside. She looked down and said, How about I teach you something else? You can do freestyle now. What about breaststroke? I looked at her. I haven’t learned anything, I said. I can’t even hold my breath. She laughed and said she hadn’t been a good teacher. I figured that I could at least float, and so we floated together, and she stole glances underwater, and told me I was good at floating.

While we were in the water, I noticed a lumpy patch just below Yang Yang’s ear, similar to the marks on her calf, mottled red and white, as though two rice porridges had been mixed together and had set on her skin. I felt I should say something; there might never be another chance. You are even braver than I thought, I said. I’m OK, she said. As she spoke, she touched the scar behind her ear. The fire burned me here as well. I always covered it with my hair. Now that I’m moving to a new environment, for some reason, I don’t know why, I don’t want to keep hiding and covering it. My mother says I’m crazy. What do you think? I asked her if she was burned anywhere else. She said yes, and showed me more, a little bit further back. She was smiling again. It was the same smile I had seen in the rehearsal room mirror that day. I didn’t know why Yang Yang wanted to tell me these things, just as I didn’t know why she had chosen to get close to me in the first place. Li Wu, she said. Today may be the closest we’ll ever be. We’ll go to middle school, then high school, then university. We may never see each other again. When I closed my eyes, I could feel her in front of me, watching me underwater.

We were still in the shower room as the three hours came to a close, standing under the shower heads, having taken off our swimming costumes, letting the water pour on our heads. Yang Yang was singing. She had been singing for a while, though I couldn’t work out what it was, and didn’t want to ask. Her babbling in the steam of the shower room was like the accompaniment to a dream, deepening the sense of parting. She turned off her shower, picked up my shower gel and shower puff, just like my mother, and put them in my shower bag. Then she squeezed under my shower head, her arm touching mine. Her skin was warm and smooth, whereas mine, even after being in the shower for so long, remained cold. I looked at her face, with water running across it, and saw a smile. I didn’t dare look down at anywhere on her body. We had always showered together, but separately, and surrounded by steam, so that we could hear but not see, and we had never looked at each other properly.

Her eyes seemed to be urging me to look but I didn’t. When you’ve gone, I said, I won’t come swimming here ever again. No matter who asks me to come. Yang Yang smiled. Well, she said, it’ll be closing down soon anyway. I turned off the shower and picked up my shower bag. She followed me out, swaying slightly. Perhaps we’d been standing in the shower room too long and needed some oxygen, because we were both slightly dizzy. We took our clothes out of our lockers and got dressed. She put on a duckling-yellow beanie and matching scarf. When we were both ready, we stood there face to face, and I remembered how we had met a year earlier. The PHS in my pocket kept vibrating, telling me my father was outside; he couldn’t come in and was getting impatient. Yang Yang pulled the scarf down from my mouth. Every time I go swimming, she said. I’ll think of you. When you miss me, just go to the swimming pool. Remember that water is like air. We can soak in the same water, and breathe the same air, and not be so far apart.

I left first. Yang Yang had always stayed on after I left, but I’d never known how long. My father was outside the building, smoking a cigarette. When he saw me, he tossed the butt aside, so cross he tripped over his words. You – you – what’s going on with you?

I didn’t know what was going on with me either. After Yang Yang left, I stopped going to Hai Shan Swimming Pool, and stopped mentioning her to my mother. Yang Yang and Hai Shan Swimming Pool seemed to share the same fate, and when I stopped thinking about them, they disappeared altogether. People no longer asked for the ‘bath house’, they took cabs to ‘opposite the special needs school’. Today, there is a private gynaecology and obstetrics hospital on the site of the old swimming pool, the remote location making it the ideal site for such a hospital. And who now could imagine that dirt road once housed an expanse of blue calm?

The coffee in front of me has gone cold, and as for my memory of Yang Yang and the swimming, it ends here. I did see her again, but that memory belongs not to this story, but to the wretched sequel to another reality, one I would erase if I could. The next time I saw her was in a shopping mall in Harbin. My mother had some errands there, so we went and stayed for a few days. While we were browsing the racks of shoes on the ground floor, Yang Yang walked up to me. I should have been surprised and excited to see her appear so suddenly, but we were both very calm. Li Wu? she said. Yang Yang? I said. We both smiled. You’ve come shopping? she said. You too? I said. She was on her own, likely waiting for someone, because after this she glanced at her watch, and hurriedly said goodbye. My mother had been trying on shoes, and as I watched Yang Yang walk away, she asked, Was that an old classmate? I said it was Yang Yang. She didn’t hear me properly, and didn’t seem to care, asking the salesperson to bring her another pair of shoes since the pair she’d tried were too small and pinched her feet.

Yang Yang was out of shape. It would be hard to convince anyone now that she had once been an excellent swimmer, that she had shone like a princess, a celebrity even, at least in those days when we had dust in our hair and dirt on our faces. I remembered the last thing she said to me when we were in the changing room: if we missed each other in future, we should go for a swim. It didn’t look as though she had swum much since then, and I couldn’t blame her – I never went back in the water either. As I’ve grown older, I’ve found that I wrap myself up tightly, avoid attention, think twice before speaking, and stick to safe environments. I prefer things to be steady and straightforward. My mother used to say that one must master a sport to learn how to breathe, and to discover one’s true self in stressful situations. Moments like that, when you can reveal your true self are rare.

My thoughts now are all jumbled up. If I were to return to the water with Yang Yang, how far would we be able to swim together? Hai Shan Swimming Pool no longer exists, many things no longer exist, but there are still traces of us in the water. With no one else around, the sound of the water in the empty swimming pool has stilled; only the laughter of young girls can be heard, as they talk about dinosaurs and the universe, jealousy and pride, words that float in the water like fish bait, catching one beautiful promise after another. The float slowly drifts away, it isn’t needed any more. That year, we were land and sea to each other. Mountains and rivers may shift, but they are always there.

    "text": "Richard, the great martyr, goes one day in March to the Palace of Westminster to sit in the Lords. As he crosses the Peers’ Lobby his heel-plates click against the tiles. The floor says, dieu et mon droit – dieu et mon droit – dieu et mon droit. The other peers say, ‘Ah, welcome back, Duke.’ He was last here six years ago, when he came down from Oxford to give his maiden speech.

The throne in the chamber is empty. Richard sits among the cross-benchers, languidly observing. On all sides he is surrounded by old people: jowly liver-spotted men in wrinkled suits, brown-toothed women in Thatcher drag, holding forth with tiresome decorum on coal imports, road safety, the economy of Northern Ireland. Richard has golden hair that parts in the middle and comes down past his ears. He wears a simple dark suit and gemstones on three of his fingers. The others can’t help looking at him. He feels them thinking, ‘Why is he here? To infect us? Or just to embarrass us?’ He does embarrass them. He is young, he is still fairly beautiful. He is back from the dead, he will show them all.

At half ten in the evening the house adjourns. Richard reclines in the library and rings the townhouse owned by William Bagot, Member for Warwick and Leamington.

William’s new wife picks up. She says, ‘Hullo, Richard. I’ve no idea where Will is, sorry.’

When Richard tries William’s office, William answers the call himself. He’s about five minutes north of Richard, in his little suite in one of the Norman Shaw buildings. He says, ‘I’ve just sent Carole home for the night. Talk dirty.’

‘No,’ Richard says. ‘I’m in the Lords Library.’

‘Ah, my little lord, exercising his hereditary right.’

‘I’d like to see you. Get us a room and I’ll meet you there.’

‘You could come to my office.’

‘If I went there this time of night I’d be accused of doing politics.’

‘Aren’t you?’

‘No. I’ve only come today because I needed the per diem.’

They meet at one of those late-Victorian railway hotels which are now all owned by American tycoons. The carpet lets off that scent of vigorous hoovering. Richard had applied a bit of L’Heure Bleue that morning, but by now it has faded.

‘It wasn’t cheap, I must say,’ says William.

‘You could have gone home and buggered your wife.’

‘Done what to her now?’

Richard gets on his knees and sucks William’s cock, which is pungent with sweat and unshaken-out piss. It is not quite the labourer’s stench; it puts one in mind of long lunches in the Members’ Dining Room, lots of crossing and uncrossing of legs. William comes on Richard’s face and Richard wipes the semen into his mouth and swallows.

They pause for whisky and cigarettes. William, with his trousers off but his socks and shirt still on, rings his secretary’s home number to tell her something he’d forgotten. Richard kneels between his legs and mouths his soft cock, his lovely heavy balls. Once William has rung off he slaps Richard’s face. He pulls Richard up by his collar and tears open his white Oxford shirt, tosses him face-down onto the bed. He yanks down Richard’s trousers and slaps his arse. He fucks Richard from behind, pushing his face into the floral duvet; he fucks Richard until it hurts, then takes off the condom and comes over Richard’s arsehole.

Satisfied, he runs Richard a bath. He sits in a chair by the tub and tells Richard what’s been happening in the other place. The Prime Minister will announce a general election soon, and William stands a chance of losing his seat.

‘To some chinless little scrap,’ Richard says.

‘With his canal boat holidays, five-a-side football, and biographies of Harry S. Truman.’

‘That’s sweet, really . . .’

‘How’s Edward, by the way?’

‘Oh, never mind. How’s Mr Major?’

They go for one more round, later that night. The curtains are shut, there is only a single lamp lit, and William kneels behind Richard and chokes him as he fucks him. There is a mirror across from the bed and they watch themselves in it. Richard sees his face flush as his vision spots white; his mouth is open, his eyes hypnotically empty, as he comes.

‘Oh! God!’ Edward says, when Richard comes home to Marylebone. ‘Your neck!’

Richard had looked at the bruises that morning, in the hotel, and pressed his fingers to them until they were sore again. William had been solicitous too, unsexily so: he had said, You’re not really hurt? And Richard had said, I’m dying anyway. But you’re not, William had said. The treatment is working.

‘I’d quite like a cup of tea,’ Richard says.

In the grey afternoon, in the study, Edward says, ‘I hope you enjoyed it.’

He sits at the desk while Richard lounges on the sofa and smokes. He has been writing cheques, balancing the chequebook, on Richard’s behalf. Richard, after a night with William, thinks Edward looks young. His face is smooth, lightly freckled, and his hair is thick. His tortoiseshell glasses somehow have the effect of making him look a bit unintelligent. He and Richard were born the same year, but Richard has had his birthday and Edward hasn’t.

‘Very much so, thanks,’ Richard says. ‘Don’t mope over it, darling, it’s just sex.’

‘Except that you tell him how to vote, and what sort of speeches he should make in the Commons.’

‘Well, it’ll all be over by summer.’

Henry Green, QC, is another one of those educated men with receding brown curls and a soft middle. His wrinkles are the kind that show he reads, writes, types, and telephones. He has a cottage in Devon and a detached red-brick Victorian south of Hampstead Heath which his estranged wife has vacated even though her father helped pay for it. He never had children by her; he did get a girl pregnant while he was training for the Bar, but she had an abortion.

Green wears calfskin gloves and gives Richard thirty lashes with a rattan cane that had come down from a grandfather who had served in the Imperial Police towards the end of the Raj. They do this in the sitting room, with the curtains closed, as the sun sets, so that darkness comes over them. Green finishes himself off over Richard’s bare, sore arse, then turns on a lamp and offers Richard a gin and tonic. They never fuck; Green once got drunk and told Richard the story of how in his first year at his public school he’d been violently buggered by three older boys in the showers after rugby practice. He pretends that he dislikes William for being common, but really it must be because William had the soft, untroubled youth of a grammar school boy.

‘I had dinner with Will Bagot the other night,’ Green mentions. ‘He asked me if I knew of any jobs going. Then he left me with the bill.’

‘It’s not your employment that’s in jeopardy.’

‘Will you contribute to his campaign?’

‘Oh, God, no,’ Richard says. ‘I haven’t got the money. Actually, I was going to ask you to take me to dinner.’

Green does take him out, if only to watch him wince as he sits down. They eat noisettes de chevreuil and Green tells Richard about his divorce. In the taxi back, Richard rubs Green’s cock through his trousers. Green kisses the bruises on Richard’s neck that William left.

It is almost a perfect night, except that when they go to bed Green canes him again and then suddenly stops, saying, ‘Oh! Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear.’

There is blood on the linen Green’s wife had picked out. Green strips the bed himself; he takes the bloodied linen down to the lower ground floor and puts it in the wash with chlorine bleach.

Edward runs Richard’s bath for him and helps him dress, and is petulantly silent, sulking through this rendering of service. He pesters Richard about taking his tablets. ‘Have you taken them yet? Have you really?’

At last (it is early in the morning, he is tired and his neck is stiff) Richard shrieks: WHY ARE YOU SUCH A BORE. YOU ONLY WANT TO KEEP ME ALIVE SO YOU CAN GO ON LIVING IN MY HOUSE. He flings his little cloisonné pillbox in Edward’s direction; the tablets spill and lodge themselves between the floorboards.

‘No,’ Edward says, sighing, ‘it’s not just that. I like when you fuck me, too.’

Two years ago, Richard had not been more than a year from death. He had traded the house in Marylebone and the bed with the blue canopy for an AIDS ward in a teaching hospital, a metal-framed cot with a rolling tray over it and his chart on a clipboard at the foot. Edward, whose father is a Hertfordshire barrister, had gone with Richard to meet his solicitor about his will, understanding that after the repayment of debts and the payment of death duties there would be nothing left for loyal companions. He’d told Richard how his parents had asked him what he would do once Richard was dead: ‘You’ve no profession,’ they’d said, ‘no money of your own, just –’

Driving Richard to hospital, carrying in the suitcases, unpacking the silk pyjamas and the woollen jumpers and the velvet slippers and Richard’s weight (then under ten stone) in books; filling one of those baby-bottleish hospital cups with the kind of rehydrating formula given to victims of famine, forcing Richard to drink it, promising coffee and cocktails later; emptying the plastic jug into which Richard pissed, or into which his catheter flowed. Going out alone to Richard’s favourite restaurants, bringing back insulated containers of veal cutlet, lamb chop, gratin dauphinois, mousse au chocolat; forcing Richard to eat it. Driving back to Marylebone to hand-wash the pyjamas when inevitably they were soiled. Reading aloud to Richard, watching telly with Richard, sitting quietly next to him with the lamps off and the curtains shut against the sun.

Richard is twenty-seven, now. He doesn’t know where death has gone. He last weighed in at eleven and a half stone, and his last T-cell count was an astonishing 350. Two or three times a week he and Edward walk down the road to the health club, swim forty lengths, then sit in the sauna. At least once a month they drive up for a few days at Lancaster Park, to enjoy country pursuits. They fuck more often than they did at twenty. When Richard examines his conscience, he notes that he lacks gratitude for the worldly processes by which he is kept alive. Blood tests, appointments with specialists, timers set to go off at seven, three, and eleven. Edward appearing with a cup of milky tea, two biscuits on the saucer, zalcitabine, saquinavir, zidovudine.

Lowering himself to the floor, Edward says, ‘My dad told me I was your dog.’

‘Oh, but a handsome fine greyhound, red brindle, with a neck like a swan’s and cute little ears and a long tail, and the blood of a hare wetting its muzzle.’

Richard goes the following evening to William’s office, carrying a bouquet with narcissi for Carole, whom he then dismisses. He goes into the small inner room and shuts but doesn’t lock the door behind him. He looks through the papers on William’s desk, then turns off the overhead light and sinks to his knees in front of William’s chair and gives him a long, wet blowjob.

Before William comes Richard says, ‘You can fuck me if you’ve got a condom. I don’t know if you have them lying about?’

The only MPs who don’t keep condoms at hand are those who risk shagging without them. William puts one on and bends Richard over the desk. Pulling down Richard’s trousers, he says, ‘Ah. Henry Green got to you first.’

‘Oh, yes, he’s got such a lot of stress to work off. It’s the divorce.’

‘Lucy has moved on quickly enough.’

‘Well, if she wants children she’ll have to have them soon.’

They find afterwards that the box of tissues on William’s desk is empty.

‘Gosh, you really have been hard at work,’ Richard says.

‘I use them to blow my nose.’

Refusing to clean his arse with his handkerchief, Richard makes William strip from the waist down and hand over his Y-fronts. William puts them back on once Richard is done, saying that if he left them in the wastebasket, the tabloids would find them and have them DNA tested.

 

–

 

The dawn comes up darkly, with rain. One of the windows has been left half-open; a cold breeze moves the curtains. Edward sleeps on his stomach. His lips are parted, showing his long front teeth, one of which slightly overlaps the other.

Richard looks up at the underside of the canopy, at the sun with its wiggling rays embroidered in gold thread. He gets up, pisses, and cleans his teeth, then dresses himself soberly and drives to Knightsbridge for eight a.m. mass at the Oratory. Gloria in excelsis Deo, et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis. Laudamus te. Benedicimus te. Adoramus te. Glorificamus te.

Parliament is prorogued on the twenty-first of March. There are some cynics who suggest the Prime Minister has done this to delay the publication of a report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards that will find Tory MPs took bribes from the Egyptian businessman who bought Harrods. It would of course have been wicked of them if they had.

William asks Richard up to Warwickshire for a couple of days. He has a sort of ‘country house’ south of Leamington Spa, a former estate cottage in higgledy-piggledy brick. Richard drives himself. He parks in the driveway and Nicola, the new wife, pops out from the side door, saying, ‘Hello! What a car! Let me take your bags.’

William’s thirteen-year-old daughter is there, too. Gemma has the broad-faced, snub-nosed, plain-pretty looks of her mother, though William’s current and former wives are more or less identical, and she could easily have passed for Nicola’s child. There is evidence of a frightful infatuation with Richard: she keeps her head down, she speaks to him only when he addresses her, but lingers near him until her father sends her away.

After dinner, Richard and William drink port in the lounge. Richard says, ‘If she were a few years older I might elope with her.’

‘That’s not funny, Richard.’

‘Oh, you’re so-o congenitally middle class.’

‘If you ever have a daughter of your own – well, you won’t.’

‘No, I suppose not,’ Richard says.

 

–

 

He wakes the next morning with the feeling that a cold is coming on. His head hurts, his throat is sore. He goes down to the kitchen and William is there, in a striped dressing gown, failing to negotiate with his own espresso machine. Richard makes coffee Turkish-style, in a pot on the stove. It is one of the few domestic tasks he has learned to do himself. He kisses William like he does after sucking his cock, with almost too much spit and tongue.

William says, ‘I’d rather not be tempted.’

Still, he holds Richard’s half-hard cock through his pyjamas. He looks into Richard’s eyes as he does it. Richard has always had the sense that, for other people, looking at him is a test of longevity in the face of pain, like putting one’s hand in the fire. But what do they think a look will do?

William kisses Richard’s cheek and says, ‘I’m going to have a shower.’

Nicola enters the kitchen dressed already in a cotton frock with buttons all the way down. She grills sausages in the Aga. The sky is grey; doves coo loudly from the shrubbery.

‘Do you feel your childhood was happy?’ Nicola asks Richard.

Richard says, ‘Oh yes.’

‘You really think so? I’m always suspicious of people who say that, because then it always transpires that their parents separated and their father shot their cat, or something.’

‘No, I had everything I could have wanted. My father did die, but by then I had already been away at school for a couple of years.’

‘Oh no,’ says Nicola. ‘I’m sorry. I’m an orphan. Well, I am now – my mum died when I was twenty-five, and my father the year after. So I didn’t have to go into an orphanage, or get sent to a maiden aunt.’

‘Do you know it’s Palm Sunday? Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an ass’s colt, and the people went forth to him with palm branches. It was the last Sunday before the Crucifixion.’

‘Will told me you threatened to elope with Gemma.’

‘Oh, that. I was just making Will squirm.’

‘I know. But you can’t let her hear of it. She’ll believe you. She’ll spend the rest of her life wondering why you never did. She’ll think you decided she was too plain. And when a decently brought-up, dark-haired man asks her to marry him, she’ll say she once almost eloped with Richard, the young Duke of Lancaster, when she was a schoolgirl, in 1997, just before her father lost his seat.’

St Mary’s, Warwick has a late mediaeval chapel, associated with the earls of Warwick, where Elizabeth I’s favourite Robert Dudley is entombed. The church by Warwick Castle is a rare eighteenth-century Gothic revival. But the Jephson Women’s Institute spring cakes and crafts fair, which Nicola is judging, is held in the hall next to a late-Victorian C of E parish church that resembles an indifferently-constructed set of a school play. The hall is low-ceilinged; Richard feels that his head is nearly up against the fluorescents. Folding tables with pink checked cloths display sponge cake, madeleines, cookies decorated to look like Easter eggs, tea urns, tea cosies, cross-stitch hoops, quilt squares, for some reason the odd Christmas ornament. William, with ostentatious humility, hands over a few coins in exchange for his poppyseed loaf and Styrofoam cup of char.

Richard is introduced by William as ‘my friend, the Duke of Lancaster.’ The women laugh and say, ‘No one told us we were going to have a duke.’ There is a reproach in that for William: why not tell us beforehand, so we could look him up in Debrett? Richard doesn’t give his Christian name, but learns the names of the eight members. These are just like the women Richard meets at village fetes, agricultural shows, tenants’ dinners, local history society fundraisers: women who have always treated him like they would his father or grandfather, even when he was a child. They wear cotton cardigans and polyester trousers.

Margaret, who was born around the time that Hitler invaded Poland, offers Richard a hot cross bun which she has added extra icing to. He bites, chews, swallows, then slips his tongue out of the corner of mouth for a flirtatious half-second. He says, ‘I’ve got icing all over my face, haven’t I?’ Margaret offers him a paper napkin with an Easter bunny design, and he says, ‘Thanks terribly, Margaret. Actually, I have a handkerchief.’

‘My mother, when we were growing up,’ Margaret says, ‘always used to tuck our handkerchiefs into our pockets before we went off to school. But somewhere along the way I got rid of them all, which is really such a shame, now that I see your beautiful one.’

‘Oh yes? This was embroidered for me by my mother. These are broom flowers. They’re a sort of family symbol.’

Gemma wears an Alice band and a department-store daisy-print frock. She sits on a plastic chair and reads Tatler. ‘The new homeless: how the shortage of £1-million-plus houses is forcing the rich on to the streets. The new sex: why gardening is better than chocolate.’ Richard supposes that women are the newer sex, comparatively! When he escapes through the side door to smoke, Gemma comes after him.

Exhaling, Richard says, ‘I hope you’re not going to ask me to give you a cigarette.’

‘I’ve smoked my mum’s before,’ she says.

‘Mm. Well, you know, I would if we were alone, but your father and stepmother are here, and then there are all of these nice women whose votes your father hopes to win.’

‘I’ve seen you in Tatler. You’re not in this issue, but you’ve been in some other ones.’

‘Oh, have you?’

‘I have a subscription here and for my mum’s house, so I read each issue twice. And then I give the extra to my friend Louise who can’t afford a subscription.’

‘You’re quite pretty,’ he tells her. ‘You could be in it someday.’

‘Not on the cover?’

‘We’ll have to see how you turn out.’

‘Um . . . with your illness, do you go to hospital . . . often?’

‘Surely that’s not the question you’ve been waiting to put to me.’

He smiles at her through the smoke. She lowers her eyes, goes stiff and red.

‘I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude,’ she says.

‘I’ll answer one question honestly,’ he says. ‘But you’ll have to look into my eyes to ask it.’

She looks into his eyes. She spends a long time looking. He spends a long time looking at her, at the three spots on her upper lip, the youthful whiteness of her sclera. His cigarette burns between his fore and middle fingers.

Richard doesn’t come down for drinks before dinner; he really does feel ill. It’s the kind of cold he always has, with a runny nose and a dry cough and a throat that hurts especially when he swallows. William comes up, knocks, and enters without being asked in.

‘Mm . . . no,’ he says to Richard, ‘you don’t look well.’

He puts the back of his hand to Richard’s forehead. Richard recognises the gesture as paternal play-acting, a perfunctory acknowledgment of duty by a man who finds it difficult to believe he is no longer a boy himself. He takes William’s face in his hands and kisses him, licking William’s spit out of his mouth.

‘Now you’ll catch whatever I have.’

‘A head cold won’t kill me,’ William says.

The house is so small and noisy that Richard wonders how the three of them hide from one another. He hears William walk down the corridor, descend the stairs, talk to Nicola and Gemma in the kitchen, though he can’t make out what they say. A slower, lighter step ascends the stairs. There is the rattle of a tray being set down on the console outside of Richard’s bedroom.

‘Room service,’ Nicola says. ‘No, it’s just me, I’ve brought dinner up for you. I’m sorry you’re feeling so badly. Just pop the tray back on this table when you’re done with it, and I’ll take everything away.’

‘Come in,’ Richard commands.

She’s dressed for dinner, in dark velvet and gold earrings. He casts his gaze towards the writing desk; she unfolds the leaf and puts the tray down there.

‘It’s just lamb with mint sauce, and, um, parsnips, carrots, and potatoes. Healthy enough. And I’ve brought a glass of wine . . . I think the Victorians used to give wine to invalids, didn’t they? And then there’s baked apple pudding.’

‘I’m sorry I couldn’t come to table,’ Richard says. ‘I would have liked to. To play happy families with you.’

‘No . . . no. You must get well.’

‘It’s New Zealand lamb?’

‘Mm.’

‘Do you remember the last British lamb you had? The last time I had it must have been at home, because at school they only gave us pork, beef, or fish.’

‘Gosh, you know – it’s the sort of thing you don’t remember because you don’t know to remember it at the time. When Chernobyl happened I was living in a flat in Fulham with three other girls, and the only things we’d cook were soup from a tin or fried eggs or things like that.’

‘Nicola, darling,’ Richard says. ‘Come here and let me take your hand.’

She sits – perhaps feeling it is her right, as the lady of the house – on the edge of the bed, and lets Richard take both of her hands in his.

‘I don’t know why,’ she says, ‘but I was so unhappy, back then. I mean, my parents had just died, and I’d no-one to go home to at Christmas except a grandmother who’d complain that I was showing too much leg, but it wasn’t the grief, it was the feeling that every other girl in London was prettier, richer, or cleverer than me. You remind me, you know, of the boy I was in love with then. Digby Hughes-Duntze . . . He was so handsome. I saw him at every party, and he never remembered who I was. You wouldn’t know what that’s like.’

‘I’ve been in love with men before.’

‘But I’ll bet they remember you.’

Richard caresses her hands. He says, ‘I hope you and William will be blessed with children.’

Nicola says, ‘Um, yes. Me, too. Very much.’

On Good Friday, Richard does the Stations of the Cross at the London Oratory, along with several other sorry sinners who keep looking at him as they pray. He is wearing a white wool overcoat.

Jesus falls the third time, and Richard begins to be enraged by His suffering. Yes, yes, so you suffer more perfectly than anyone else because you’re the son of God. And it’s my fault because I can’t stop sinning.

Beneath the marble relief of Jesus stripped of his garments, Richard wipes his nose, then kneels and murmurs a Pater Noster. He imagines having his coat and suit torn off, being stripped even of his striped socks. He imagines being tied to the altar rail and whipped until his thighs are wet with blood.

They have drinks at the hotel bar, first. William tells Richard about the preparations for his campaign. He pays for the drinks with one of his campaign-related cards, though he has paid in cash, he tells Richard, for the room.

In the room there is just enough space to walk around the big, white bed. The worn carpet is cream-coloured, the faux-Georgian panelling butter-yellow. There are scuffs and chips at the bottoms of the doorframes. The mirror – a small one, hung above the little desk, offset from the bed – is streaky.

William tunes the black plastic clock-radio to ‘The World Tonight’. Richard drops to his knees, and William lifts his foot so that the sole of his shoe dirties the front of Richard’s white silk shirt. He presses forward until Richard falls back onto the floor. Slowly the scarred leather sole comes to occlude Richard’s vision. Richard shuts his eyes and sticks out his tongue until he tastes the Palace of Westminster’s degenerating Pugin-Minton tiles.

When Richard tries to get his cock out, William nudges his side with the toe until he rolls onto his front. Then William pulls Richard’s trousers down to his knees and fucks him. He comes inside of the condom inside of Richard, and lies afterwards on top of him, pinning him to the floor. Richard’s stiff cock chafes against the carpet. His nose drips onto his lip. At last William sits up and takes off the condom, then takes off Richard’s clothes.

Naked, lying in that narrow channel between the dresser and the bed, Richard lets himself be looked at. It makes him sad to be admired like this, but he couldn’t live if he wasn’t.

‘Nicola tells me you told her you hoped we’d have children,’ William says.

‘I do.’

‘She is pregnant. It’s still too early to announce.’

‘Oh. I’m so happy for you.’

William picks Richard up and puts him down on the bed. He unbuttons his own shirt, pulls off his own trousers. He ransacks his jacket pockets for another condom.

‘With any luck I’ll get a boy this time.’

‘Yes, it would be nice if you did.’

The second round starts with Richard riding William, looking down at him. There must be something William doesn’t like about that: before Richard can come, William tips him back, gets on top of him, and fucks him like a man fucks a wife. He does this until Richard is crying out. With his cock still inside of Richard, he stops, kisses him sweetly. He withdraws just far enough that he can peel the condom off, then keeps fucking him. He comes inside of him, kissing him, and stays hard long enough that he can fuck Richard into an orgasm that really is like death.

On the radio, a man is reading a Conrad story about duelling hussars in Napoleon’s Grande Armée. Richard is lying on his back, wet between the legs, wet in the eyes – that is, weeping.

William sits up, saying, ‘Please, don’t do that.’

‘What if all of my ancestors back to the very beginning, and all of the people who are going to learn about me after I’m dead, will all know everything I’ve done, and hate me for it?’

‘Sounds like displaced fear of God.’

‘But God forgives.’

‘There’s such a sense of melodrama about it all – your religion. People are always having fits, and bleeding spontaneously, and calling it a miracle.’

‘I believe in it,’ Richard says.

William retrieves Richard’s handkerchief and blots Richard’s face with it. He says, ‘Yes, sweetie. I know. Come here.’

Richard is sent back to Marylebone in a cab. Riding along the empty park, illuminated by ugly, sharp lamplight, he starts to cry again. When he lets himself back into the house, the lamps are off and Edward is asleep in their – in Richard’s – bed. Richard sits on his side of the bed and cries until Edward wakes up.

‘What,’ Edward says.

‘I don’t really want to die,’ Richard says.

‘Well, you won’t, darling.’

‘Ugh, I hate when you try to console me. You get such an awful tone to your voice. Well, you won’t, dar-ling . . . Is that how your mother used to talk to you? All my mother ever says is that she’ll pray a novena for me.’

‘Do you not want me here?’

‘Of course I do,’ Richard says. ‘If you leave me alone I’ll die.’

‘Honestly, you might. You wouldn’t have picked up those tablets yourself.’

‘You’re still going on about the tablets.’

‘Did you take your elevens?’

‘Oh my God. I am going to Lord Lucan you.’

Bravely Edward turns on the lamp and goes down the corridor to the bathroom. Richard hears him filling a glass from the sink. He comes back and shakes three tablets out of the pillbox.

‘Open hand,’ Edward commands.

Richard sticks out his tongue; Edward puts the two smaller tablets on it, then gives him a sip of water, then gives him the third, larger tablet, then another sip. Then Edward kisses him, and Richard says, ‘I can’t believe I love you as much as I do.’

Edward is very easy to get with lines like these. He flushes beautifully. Richard smiles at him and holds the side of his face.

‘It’s just all of these old men,’ Richard says, ‘with their wives and children.’

‘They’re not old. They’re like forty-five.’

‘Older than I’ll ever be.’

‘Richard –’

‘Metaphorically,’ Richard says. ‘Or in spirit.’

‘Because of the children?’

‘You could still have them, you know.’

‘Not . . . not really.’

‘I would be happy if you did. I’d even be happy if you had a wife.’

‘I just don’t think I will,’ Edward says.

Richard pulls Edward into bed and kisses him until they’re hard. They rub against each other through their clothes like Richard used to do at school with the boy he loved then. He rolls Edward onto his stomach and pulls off his cute little pinstriped pyjama trousers; he plays with Edward’s arsehole a bit before getting up for a condom and K-Y, and to take his own clothes off. He kisses the back of Edward’s neck and rubs his cock against Edward’s arsehole until he sees that Edward is flushed down to his shoulders. Then he fucks him: he puts one hand on the headboard and one hand on Edward’s hip, and gives his whole strength to the endeavour. He makes Edward cry out; he makes them both sweat. He turns Edward over and fucks him face-to-face, and keeps at it until Edward, whose cheeks are deep red, gives a precious wobble of the lower lip and says, ‘Oh – oh my God. I’m coming.’

Richard hardly cares to come himself, after that. But he won’t forgo an orgasm that’s more or less inevitable, so he lies back and looks up at the underside of the canopy and tosses himself off as Edward pants beside him.

‘I bled on Henry Green’s wife’s linen,’ Richard says.

‘I thought he was divorced.’

‘Well, not yet. She’s living elsewhere, but she hasn’t taken her nice things out of the house.’

‘Yeah . . . Well, it’s her fault, isn’t it, when she knows what her husband does when she’s not there . . .’

‘I was bent over the bed,’ Richard says, ‘and my face was down, my eyes were closed, and he said, “Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.” Like I’d made a mistake. It was just a spatter, like from the flick of a paintbrush. I’ve lost more blood from a nosebleed. But he scrubbed my arse-cheeks with a hand towel and then stripped the bed and put it all in the wash with bleach. I laughed at him. I said, “If you’re that afraid, you shouldn’t be having an affair with me.” He said he wasn’t afraid. But he was lying.’

Edward says, ‘I’m not afraid.’

Coming up the long drive, Richard looks at Lancaster Park and thinks exactly what he should not: This is all mine. He feels about it just like he does about his body. The roof leaks, the cellars flood, the damp rises, the foundations sink, the coal-fired boiler is so old that there is only one man left in England who can repair it. Each time Richard comes home there is another part of the house that has rotted away. But he’ll be gone before the house, so what does it matter?

Richard’s mother kisses his cheek, then flings her arms around him and squeezes. She kisses Edward’s cheek. Her cloudy-eyed, foul-smelling old Pekingese gets underfoot. She says, ‘So good to see you again, Ned. How are your parents? How was the drive up? Does Dickie ever let you drive that thing? Oh, lovely flowers! For me!’

It is Holy Saturday. That night the three of them attend the Easter Vigil at Lancaster Cathedral, where a triptych above the altar presents scenes from the Passion edged by gilding almost Islamic in its curvilinearity. In the dark, the stained glass is invisible; the light of God is in the candles, which deepen the night.

The bells toll. Along with the choir Richard sings: Filius Patris, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis. The tears come again. God is here, and Richard is in a state of mortal sin. He could have received the Host if he had only confessed, but he couldn’t confess, because he wasn’t sorry.

Alone in the kitchen past midnight, Richard and his mother smoke cigarettes and drink Armagnac, sitting across from each other at the long scullery table where the staff have always eaten. His mother wears a mint-green cotton bathrobe over a 30s film star sort of nightgown; her face is stage-white, covered in night cream.

‘I’ve been having such a hard time with these headaches,’ she says. ‘I always have to lie down. I drove into town to see Dr Thompson and he told me to take more salt. I don’t know what “more” means. Am I supposed to be spooning it into my mouth from the salt cellar? Anyway, I had Thomas and Eleanor and Roger and Gillian last weekend. And Roger’s niece, Teresa, who’s quite clean. I would tell you to marry her, but I just don’t like Roger. He gets appallingly drunk, and vomits into the wastebasket in his room.’

‘I told Edward he should get married,’ Richard says.

‘Shall I introduce him to Teresa?’

‘He said he wouldn’t.’

‘Well, of course he says that.’

Richard’s mother is known to have been a great beauty in her youth. She married at nineteen because she was proposed to by a better man than she could have expected to offer, an officer of the Grenadier Guards who was at least square-jawed and strapping despite having eyebrows that met in the middle. It was through this first husband that she met Richard’s father. Richard’s father is known to have been a great beauty, also. His mother was a Dutch model; his father was the Duke of Lancaster, a title which he himself would not live to inherit. He was captain of his school’s First XV, and took two years to climb the Alps before studying agriculture at RAU Cirencester. He rode, hunted, shot; he drank at the village pub with his father’s tenants , one of whom described him posthumously to Richard as having never been driven indoors by the rain. But he spent the last ten years of his life indoors, in his bedroom or in an armchair in the smoking room with the fire going, holding a hot water bottle to his stomach, hobbling every thirty minutes down the corridor to the loo, shitting himself sometimes when he couldn’t help it, snarling at his wife about the tea being cold, the milk being sour, the fire being smoky, the dogs being muddy, the gardens being overgrown.

Richard takes Edward to ride to hounds one last time before the season is out. They join the Caton Hunt, who for forty years have been given leave to hunt over the land owned by the dukes of Lancaster. Before that, there had been kennels at Lancaster Park. The subscribers are small landowners, local professionals; Richard resents that they are not the country squires of eighteenth-century political cartoons. Mounted, they gather on the grass at the entrance to the wood and drink their glasses of port. The horses breathe visibly into the dawn air.

Edward – in white breeches and a red coat with hunt buttons, astride the thoroughbred hunter Richard gave him for his twentieth birthday – is a true prince of the sport. He rides with an arrogant posture he never takes when he isn’t on a horse. Once the hounds find the scent, he rides hard; he stays at the front of the field and jumps every hedgerow and fence. Richard waits for the gates to be opened.

Over the course of the morning the fox is lost twice. The sun keeps rising, the hounds begin to strain. A great stretch of country is hunted. The followers fall behind, disappear into the wood. But when the fox breaks cover the third time, it lags across a wide, fallow field and the hounds overtake it. Richard watches from some distance. The huntsman blows his horn to announce the death, then dismounts and takes the head and tail before giving the corpse back to the hounds. The limbs are torn from the body; the guts are spilled; the scraps are tossed from one muzzle to another. Edward keeps his hunter steady; he sits straight-backed and panting, with his red hair curling out from under his cap. He doesn’t look back at Richard until the horn signals the hounds to go home.

Edward comes to Richard’s room that night. He strikes a match, lights one of the candles on the mantlepiece, and takes his glasses off. The room still smells of woodsmoke and of the last cigarette Richard smoked before turning off the lamp. The candlelight brings out from the darkness just the slightest impression of the picture above the fireplace, a thickly-worked study of a swan in dark water that had been painted by a lover of Richard’s great-grandfather. The wall next to the bed is taken up by a seventeenth-century tapestry depicting huntsmen in pursuit of a stag.

Richard says, ‘Will you get the fire going again?’

‘No,’ Edward says, whipping the covers back. He seizes Richard by the ankles and pulls him out of bed.

Richard is naked; his bare knees thump sharply down against the Persian carpet, beneath which is hard oak. He lowers himself to kiss Edward’s feet before he puts Edward’s cock in his mouth. Edward gets his hands in Richard’s hair but keeps them still and lets Richard suck him off. He’s a Catholic, too, he knows how long it takes for the supplicant’s pleasure at penitential discomfort to turn into real agony. By the time Edward does come – thickly, in Richard’s mouth – Richard’s knees hurt so much that in order to tolerate it he has to let himself accept the pain.

‘Swallow,’ Edward says.

Having swallowed, Richard says, ‘Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie. Ha ha.’

It’s a joke he’s made before. Edward slaps Richard’s face; Richard turns his cheek and Edward slaps him again. Then Edward puts two fingers in Richard’s mouth and Richard sucks them until Edward is hard again.

When Edward fucks Richard, he gets down on the floor to do it: he sits with his legs under him and pulls Richard into his lap. Slowly Richard falls back until the carpet is scratching his shoulders. He looks up at Edward’s foolish frown, his open mouth. He says, ‘I wish I were a girl. I’d have kept myself pure. You could have married me, and broken my hymen on our wedding night. I would have had a dozen of your children.’ Then he says, ‘Oh, God,’ because he’s coming. ‘Keep fucking me,’ he says, ‘come inside me.’

‘I am,’ Edward says. ‘Fuck. Oh. Oh.’

They lie next to each other and watch the cracks in the ceiling moving with the candlelight. Richard scrubs his semen from his stomach with Edward’s dressing gown. Then he takes the condom off Edward’s cock and licks him clean.

‘Oww,’ Edward says. ‘Ohh. I can’t take it, my cock’s wrung like a fucking . . . chicken’s neck.’

Richard says, ‘Mine’s fine.’

He drops another piece of wood into the fireplace, on top of the red coals, then tosses in a few crumpled pages of the Telegraph and strikes a match.

Getting into bed again, Edward says, ‘You wouldn’t really want to be a girl and bear my children.’

‘Christ. No.’

‘I mean, you wouldn’t have inherited the title, for one thing.’

‘Well, no.’

Richard pinches out the candle with his thumb and forefinger. It hurts for about thirty seconds, a novelty among the other pains.

‘Mm . . .’ Edward yawns. ‘I hope we’ll have time for a little trot round the park after mass tomorrow. See the deer.’

Richard sees William’s daughter once more, late in June of that year. He is driving home after a party in Chelsea and he sees her waiting for a night bus, alone, in a black miniskirt and black tights. The convertible top is down, so that she sees him, too.

‘Good God,’ he says. ‘You’re lucky I happened to be here to ferry you home.’

She’d gone out, she tells him, with a cousin and the cousin’s friends from Cheltenham Ladies’. They hadn’t liked her, they had made fun of her, and they had left for an afterparty without giving her the address. She’s staying this week at her mother’s house in Richmond, but Richard says he doesn’t mind taking her there. He likes a long drive on a fine summer night, with the moon a voyeur somewhere above him. Gemma looks through his cassettes and says she doesn’t know what any of them are. It is the happiest she has ever been, he supposes: in London, out past midnight, riding along the King’s Road in the passenger seat of a yellow sports car driven by a good-looking man she thinks might ask her to one of his parties, later.

He says, ‘I saw your father on television, losing his seat. Were you there?’

‘No, I had school in the morning, so they wouldn’t let me come. But they left me at home alone, so I stayed up anyway and watched it on telly. And then I asked them not to have to go to school because everyone would be talking about it, but they made me, and then everyone was talking about it.’

‘What will he do now?’

‘I don’t know. He’s going to be the director of a company, or something.’

‘I hope you weren’t disappointed.’

‘No. I don’t really care.’

They are crossing the river, passing the dense silhouettes of the trees on the grounds of Fulham Palace. Gemma is turning the radio dial, lingering in the static. Lampposts rise at intervals along each side of the bridge; their triple circles of light – in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti – obscure the dark water below.

Too shy to pose it as a question, she says, ‘So you couldn’t ever have children. Even if you decided to be straight.’

‘No,’ he says.

‘So you won’t have an heir to pass everything on to.’

‘No.’

‘Who’s going to get it instead?’

‘A cousin. My father’s younger brother’s son.’

‘Oh . . . Do you wish you could have children just, like, in a normal way? I mean, like, just to be a father?’

‘Well, it doesn’t matter now.’

‘Dad and Nicola have these awful fights over you.’

‘I’m sorry.’

She asks him, ‘But what do you wish?’

‘I don’t wish anything, darling.’

The windows of her mother’s house are dark, though the porch light is on. Ivy droops from the facade, heavy with new growth and stirring in the air. Gemma has a key, she says, but also she’s left open a window on the lower ground floor she can crawl inside. The road ends in a locked gate to the park. Richard imagines the deer in his own park asleep and dreaming. He watches Gemma go headfirst through the window; her face reappears, then, looking out at him. They wave goodbye. He shuts off the radio and turns back towards the river."

    "text": "Lu Dong moves the standing lamp, turns to gauge how far he is from the wall, then goes back to the chair he’d carefully positioned – no, never mind the chair, better to be prone on the floor. Pulling open the glass door, he steps out onto the balcony and extends a clothes-drying pole into the open air. Not heavy enough. That’s the most pressing problem – not the lamp, not the color of the floorboards, not the table in his peripheral vision distracting him from his target, but the pole’s insufficient weight.

His wife Liu Yiduo and their child are in the bedroom playing Lego. He hears his daughter say, Mama, I can’t read the plan, but I know this wheel is wrong. Lu Fan is four and a half, and can already express herself fairly well. Sometimes she uses startling metaphors. During New Year, when their neighbors were setting off fireworks high into the sky, she said, Look, Baba, the stars are breaking apart. Lu Dong keeps his child’s words locked in his heart, a whole string of quotes he’s memorized – not to repeat to anyone else, just for himself. He believes Lu Fan is an extraordinary child who will do exceptional work someday, something superlative. She could be an artist, but not just any kind of artist. No, when she’s grown, some new form of art will surely emerge – maybe she’ll sit among a crowd and spout metaphors, or wear a helmet that allows her to beam the imaginings of her mind directly onto a screen. But this speculation has to be kept under wraps for now, otherwise it’ll be like when you lift the lid off a pot of steaming rice too soon, and it seizes up half raw.

Lu Dong is a fifth-rate actor – that’s by his own ranking system. The first-rate are the big movie stars with burnished reputations who make headlines with every appearance, the ones who earn money as easily as turning on a tap. Second-rate actors are talented enough to support themselves with their craft – they have numerous films or TV series to their names, and reach deep into the human heart with every role. Third-rate actors are youngish and show potential but haven’t been in anything really good yet. People think well of them and with time, depending on personal development and luck, they might attain the first or second rank. The general public would struggle to name any fourth-rate actors, but their faces are familiar from the many TV shows they appear in, playing roles that leave no impression whatsoever. Their features are like a faded backdrop you know you’ve seen before, and as soon as they appear on-screen you feel a sort of reassurance – that’s right, this is the sort of show I’ve always watched, and here are the people who help me pass the time. So what’s a fifth-rate actor? Someone who’s been in quite a few shows, but for whatever reason – whether it’s skill or appearance – he might as well not have done any. He’s spoken many lines and been featured in many shots, but at the end of the day his screen time vanishes as cleanly as water seeping down into the earth. Then a decade passes and he’s still in the profession, never really having been out of work though he’s often just twiddling his thumbs. According to Lu Dong, this sort of actor tends to be once-divorced, and now rents an apartment in an okay location, not too far from where other screen actors live. Sometimes at the supermarket a star he’s worked with will be standing in line behind him in a face mask and dark glasses, but these stars never recognize him. He’s wanted to turn and say, Hey, remember me? That night shoot five years ago – I carried you through the woods on my back, dodging bursts of gunfire, but just as I managed to sling you onto a pony a bullet got me and I died. So far he’s only ever thought these words, paid for his groceries, then left.

It’s a Sunday morning in Beijing, and the May air is full of floating willow catkins. Lu Dong hefts the pole in his hand. His heart feels more arid than ever before. Three nights ago he had dinner with his lover, then they headed to her place. Usually he doesn’t drink much, just enough to take the edge off, but that night he had more than a glass or two because he was getting tired of her, and vice versa, probably. They both needed new partners. Alcohol loosened his tongue, and he began bragging about how he’d always get to the highest point when they played climb-the-flagpole in high school. He’d shimmy down with his legs clamped tight around the slippery pole, pleasurable in a way he couldn’t describe. He never got all the way up to the red flag, even though he was at his strongest then, his legs would always give out a couple of meters from the flag and he’d slide back down. One time it was snowing and he climbed toward the falling flakes, wearing gloves and kneepads, and he almost made it, his hand was reaching out to where the flag met the pole when a girl down below tugged at the rope and sent it flicking out to hit him in the eye. He lost his grip and fell. Broke his arm. Swiping at her phone, his lover asked if he could spend the night, but he said no, which brought an end to their nostalgia-tinged drinking session.

On the way home, the night breeze carried a vegetal scent. Outside a nightclub a man sat on the curb smoking, looking remarkably sober. The man glanced at Lu Dong’s face, then lowered his head again. A few seconds later, he called out, Hey, where do I know you from? Lu Dong had recognized him: Zhang Yu, a well-known director of arthouse films. Fifteen years ago, he’d made a small film with a budget of 300 grand with Lu Dong as the second lead, a contract killer who kept losing his wallet, a role for which he was paid 5,000 yuan. Lu Dong hadn’t put on much weight since then, though his face was now fleshier, mostly pouching beneath his eyes and on his jowls. The eyelashes that Zhang Yu had hired him for were still as resplendent as ever, reaching out like a pair of quotation marks, though the eyes they framed look smaller thanks to the pouching. It’s me, Lu Dong, he said. I was in one of your films. Oh, right, said Zhang Yu, I remember. Come, sit. Cigarette? Lu Dong smoked two packs a day so he sat down and took the proffered cigarette. It was rather mild, but the tobacco seemed to become a giant finger inside his lungs, and his face went red right away.

It was too noisy inside, Zhang Yu said, and they’re all drunk. I doubt anyone even noticed me leave. Lu Dong nodded. Zhang Yu might have won a Golden Bear and a Silver Lion, but he seemed the same as before – whether on set or in his private life, as soon as a situation bored him he’d go off on his own. He seems as shy as ever, Lu Dong thought, and just like before he gets embarrassed for other people, which causes him unnecessary pain. What are you busy with? Zhang Yu asked. Running around, Lu Dong said, taking on whatever roles I can. You married? Yes, said Lu Dong. My daughter’s four. That’s good, said Zhang Yu, I’ve been divorced twice in the last decade. The second time was like a photocopy of the first – I remember back in the day you weren’t in favor of me getting married, but I didn’t listen. Turns out you were right. You’re a good actor, you know, it’s just that you don’t fit in and there’s nothing special about your looks. But the real problem is that your desire is low and your boiling point is high. With successful actors it’s the other way round.

Lu Dong nodded and said nothing. He was well aware of where he stood, but he loved acting. That’s not the sort of thing you say out loud. True, he’d persisted till now out of love for the craft, but when you say something like that it sounds fake. Zhang Yu shook another cigarette from the pack, tapped it on his knee and said, Walk a few paces. Lu Dong stood and did as he was asked. Go a little farther, Zhang Yu said, up to that streetlight. Lu Dong kept going, suddenly realizing he ought to walk properly, as if a voice from very far away was saying, I’m begging you, take this seriously. A tender voice. Motherly, pleading. As he walked he loosened his belt, and when he reached the streetlight, he let loose a stream of piss that he’d been holding in for some time. Then he fastened his trousers and came back.

Zhang Yu indicated for him to sit again. Come be in my new film, he said. It’s a supporting role, but there’s nothing run-of-the-mill about it, a colorful part, you know what I mean? Lu Dong’s belly churned and he thought he might need to shit. Sure, he said. Thank you, Director Zhang. What’s your usual fee? Zhang Yu asked. I’m very cheap, Lu Dong said, just pay me whatever you think. Let’s go with a round number, a hundred grand, Zhang Yu said. I know that’s not a lot – maybe it’s not commensurate with your ability. I hope you don’t mind. It’s a three-month shoot in Xi’an, starting two months from now. You won’t need to learn Shaanxi dialect, we’ll film in Mandarin. I’m still working with the same crew. You’ve met most of them. They’re still in there, singing karaoke. Come back inside with me in a moment and I’ll reintroduce you. They’ve gotten older just like I have, as you’d expect. The script is adapted from a story by a Xi’an author, Han Chun. I’ll send you a copy tomorrow, along with a contract. You’ll be playing a killer again – a sharpshooter. You like noodles? I can’t remember. Frankly my digestion isn’t great, said Lu Dong, so I’m always eating noodles. Good, said Zhang Yu, go learn to cook noodles. You’ll need to have a relationship with noodles as well as with your rifle. This character treats shooting as a very serious business, like they say, ‘Where the focus lies, there you’ll find the spirit.’ Know what I mean? I’ll start practicing, said Lu Dong. I don’t need you to practice, said Zhang Yu. I need you to become the character. And you’ll need to lose a bit of weight off your face too.

The next morning Zhang Yu’s assistant sent over the short story, the script and a contract. Lu Dong hadn’t slept since he got home at three that morning. He still hadn’t said a word to Yiduo. He lay in bed, eyes wide open, not the least bit tired, worrying about all sorts of things. Out of nowhere, he started getting anxious about Zhang Yu’s health – what if he died that very day? His daughter wet the bed, and he got up to change the sheets. Lu Fan was eating candy in her dreams, her jaws working away vigorously, her little hands pawing at his face as if to remove a wrapper. The contract was pretty standard, no obvious pitfalls. After he signed it he showed it to Yiduo, then put it in the mail. For some years now, Yiduo had been running a special effects company which was doing quite well. Mostly she rendered adorable demons and scatterbrained gods. She wasn’t working that day, so she cooked him lunch and dinner, and in between she read the story and script through carefully. Lu Dong’s role was a supporting character who only appeared in one of the subplots, and though he had hardly any lines, he was in twenty-three scenes and had a distinctive personality. Most importantly the part suited Lu Dong: his character was a rather dull, emotional person who somehow kept doing the wrong thing. The story wasn’t too long, maybe 10,000 words, and the character first appeared in the following paragraph:

 

The gunman lies prone on the ground. Through his scope he can see Old Dong examining the woman’s wound, then studying the drawing on the wall. The gunman studies it along with him. It doesn’t look finished. According to his understanding of art, it’s missing the most important brushstroke. He pulls the trigger. The bullet grazes Old Dong’s throat and sinks into the wall. Now the picture’s complete. He disassembles the rifle and packs it into his rucksack, rolls up the mat, and leaves. He’s Chinese and speaks with a northern accent, but has an English name: Dick.

 

Dick only works for one man, Boss Chen, whom he met ten years ago while hunting in Africa. In the decade since he’s been given three to four jobs a year, each one lasting about two months from preparation to the actual killing. Afterwards, he leaves the country and goes wandering for half a month before coming back. Ever since Dick shot a person for the first time, he’s never again hunted an animal.

Back when he was in an acting troupe Lu Dong had fired a real gun, loaded with blanks. He no longer has access to it, and it’s illegal to buy even a fake gun online. Which is how, this early morning, Lu Dong comes to be messing around with a clothes-drying pole. In a bid to increase its weight, he wraps a bath towel around it, fastening it in place with a three-finger-wide thickness of clear tape. All morning he lies prone on his balcony. By May Beijing is already very warm. Lu Dong stares at the T-junction below. To the south of the intersection is a huge shopping mall, built fairly recently, shaped like a ship. The ground floor is all advertisements for well-known brands – the Tesla logo like an anchor sunk into a blood-red backdrop. A narrow road runs to the north, only just wide enough for two lanes of traffic, frequently mired in gridlock. To either side are small shopfronts, from hotpot restaurants to pink-curtained sex shops. This used to be a hutong, and from upstairs he can still see a public bathroom tucked away behind the shops. Further along is a gas station, bulging from the narrow road like an Adam’s apple, the main reason it gets so congested here. Lu Dong skips both breakfast and lunch. In the afternoon he lies in bed reading the script. Feeling like his brain lacks oxygen, he roots in the fridge and finds an apple, which he eats. That night he’s so hungry he can’t sleep, and he keeps belching. This contract killer isn’t a famine victim, Yiduo says. You can’t go on like this. I don’t have many lines, so the most important thing is how I look, Lu Dong says. Besides, my face is so greasy, I need to do something about it. Yiduo reaches out to stroke his cheek and says, I understand you, and our daughter does too. Today she told me she’s not going to play with you anymore, she doesn’t want to disturb you. Anyway you can’t just quit eating. Why don’t you exercise instead? I’ll dig out your running shoes tomorrow. Eat a little less, and start jogging – that’s more sustainable.

At six the next morning, while Yiduo is still in bed, Lu Dong makes himself a packet of instant noodles, finds the running shoes himself, and goes for a jog around the block. His legs feel so heavy that he doesn’t even make it out of his compound, and has to walk back looking like he’s been dredged from the water. Now he recalls the last time he exercised: six years ago. This was right after he got married to Yiduo, when they were still living on the west side of the city. He was the breadwinner then. On the weekends they’d head to the university to play badminton, then walk back hand in hand to their tiny apartment. Then Lu Fan was born, and he hasn’t exercised since. Yiduo works during the day while Lu Fan is at kindergarten, and normally Lu Dong wouldn’t be up this early. Now he heats up milk for the two of them and toasts some bread. Yiduo eats, but Lu Fan refuses – she wants to have breakfast at kindergarten. Even so, she approves of Lu Dong’s new routine. Baba, she says, this way we’ll get to spend more time together. Lu Dong now wonders why he used to sleep so much – no particular reason, it’s just that he can’t drive, so he’s not the one who takes his daughter to school. Also in sleep he feels clean, safe. No matter what troubles you have in your dreams, you can wake up from them, then ah, you’re in this empty home, everyone performing their roles, nothing goes wrong, no one sees through him, he lies alone in the soft bed as if he’s only just been born. He is afraid of sweet dreams, fears their falseness, fears the moment of waking and realizing he must still endure this happy life, fears understanding that he has committed every conceivable crime but lacks the courage to take responsibility, and that no one even wants him to be held accountable. Before they head out he hugs Yiduo and Lu Fan, lightly grazing his daughter’s face with his stubble, feeling both the rightness and regret within this gesture.

After they leave, Lu Dong eats the rest of the bread, takes up his pole again, and resumes his prone position on the balcony. This time round he finds a rug to lean on – actually Lu Fan’s bath towel from when she was two, now too small for her, but exactly the right size to cushion his elbows so they stop aching. A tripod would be useful, something to rest the rifle on, but there’s nothing like that in the apartment, so he grabs some books from the shelf and places those beneath the barrel.

For the next half-hour or so he keeps his eyes fixed on a woman, probably a nanny, leading an enormous black hound on a leash. Its head is the size of a bucket, brown collar as respectable as a necktie, while the woman is scrawny, short-necked and short-limbed, scurrying along ahead of the dog, which keeps stopping. When it extrudes two thick logs of shit, she wraps them in a Kleenex and, looking around to make sure no one’s watching, quickly trots over to the ornamental pond in the center of their compound and flings them in. A boy about Lu Fan’s age spots the dog, jumps off his skateboard, and insists on clambering onto the dog’s back. The dog goes along with it, even half kneeling to help the boy get on. The boy’s mother arrives and scoops him up. The dog licks her ankle, and the mother shrieks. She takes off running with the boy in her arms. Lu Dong aims his rifle at the mother’s head, keeping his sights trained on her until she vanishes into another building. When he turns back the dog is gone too, and all he can see is the wind shaking the compound’s peach trees, scattering blossoms.

Gazing into the distance, his eyes land on the metro station outside the mall. It’s surging with people, the dense crowd like churning slurry. A lone man pushes his way out, one of the very few exiting rather than entering. He crosses the road and goes to the window counter of a grocery store, buys a pack of cigarettes, then heads toward Lu Dong’s compound. He is about Lu Dong’s age, a little thinner with a receding hairline that reveals two patches of pale forehead scalp. Light blue jacket and black sweatpants. Lu Dong aims the rifle at him. The man stops outside the compound, rips open the pack and starts to smoke. Seeing him like this through the railings, Lu Dong imagines him as a criminal. What is he here for? Perhaps to steal some rich man’s lover. Quite a few mistresses live in this compound, he knows, alone in large apartments. They wear lipstick even if they’re just going to the supermarket, sleep all day and all night too. But no, Lu Dong reminds himself, he’s meant to be a killer, why would a killer murder a criminal? Outlaws aren’t like actors, who readily turn against members of their own profession. Okay, so maybe this guy is a plain-clothes police officer who’s been tailing Lu Dong for a couple of years now, and has finally tracked down where he lives. Take one more step and you’re dead, Lu Dong whispers to himself. The man drops his cigarette butt and saunters back the way he came.

A strong wind starts up around noon. The old people resting their legs in the courtyard and the nannies with their young charges all disappear. Bereft of targets, Lu Dong dozes off. When he wakes up, he feels despair – how could a professional killer fall asleep at his post like this? He stands up and gets some cold milk from the fridge, then wanders around the apartment. There are no toy guns anywhere. If only Lu Fan were a boy, he thinks. He texts Yiduo: If it’s convenient, could you pick up a toy rifle on your way home? Ideally more than a meter long with a scope. He reads the story again. It’s very short, and lacks detail. After Boss Chen’s death Dick keeps working, and in fact most of the narrative is about this period of his life: after lying low for a while, he begins taking out men who urinate in public. Lu Dong reads the script again, which doesn’t provide any more insight into Dick’s motivation. Shooting public urinators doesn’t earn him any money, and it takes quite a lot of effort. Boss Chen used to tell him the time, place and target, and all he had to do was find a good vantage point, lie in wait, open fire, and escape. It’s not like he can just wait in the same place with his sights trained on a utility pole, because it would be too easy to find him by following the bullet’s trajectory. He’d need to spot an offender, follow him, and take him out when he’s not actually peeing. Maybe he’d be stepping out of a local supermarket or waiting for his kids at the kindergarten gate when the bullet enters his brain from some distant window. Lu Dong texts Zhang Yu:

 

Sir, I’d like to know more about Dick’s psychology – who are his parents? Who does he love? Does he prefer tea or Coca-Cola? Does he sleep on his back or his side? After killing someone, does he go for noodles or have a shower? Most importantly, why does he shoot people who urinate in public? Is he a radical environmentalist? Or does he have trouble peeing? Sorry to bother you, any tips you can share would be a great help.

 

Zhang Yu doesn’t immediately reply.

Lu Dong has a shower, then goes through the script and looks at Dick’s lines, all twelve of them:

 

1. A pack of Esse cigarettes, please. Green, not blue. No, not that one, give me the one third row down, fifth from the left.

2. (on the phone) Okay, got it. What kind of lion? Where did it bite you? Please tell your wife I’m broken up about this. I’ll never contact you again.

3. See where I’m pointing? Walk down this road. After the first junction, you’ll see a Japanese elementary school. Don’t turn, keep going straight. At the second junction, there’ll be a congee shop on your right. Turn toward it and keep going about 500 meters to the massage parlor. That’s the place you want. The masseur isn’t actually blind, he just keeps his eyes shut.

4. I don’t like the noodles you made today. I can tell you’re in a bad mood – they’re all clumping together.

5. This is a you problem, not a me problem. Know the difference. Maybe one day my problems will become your problems, but you should pray that day never comes.

6. People envy birds because they can fly, but I don’t. I can shoot them out of the sky anytime I want. I envy the flowing river. You can’t stop a river. Even if you build a dam, you haven’t stopped the river, it’s just waiting.

7. Wrong number.

8. There seems to be a misunderstanding. I hope that’s a business issue, and nothing personal. If I’ve accidentally attracted your attention, that’s because you’re too sensitive. People die in this world every single day. You need to be less sensitive.

9. And another thing, where’d the noodle shop go?

10. Peeing in public is a dangerous business. I’m telling you this because you have two kids. Look up. That thing is called the sun. It shines down on you and fills each day with warmth. You shouldn’t be living like this. Build yourself a nice bathroom in your house, and go enjoy it whenever you feel the urge to pee. Pass this habit on to your children.

11. Go ahead, study me, put me under the microscope. Your hearts are dead. What good could a microscope do you?

12. Could the person who shot me step forward? Hi, my name’s Dick, what’s your name?

 

Lu Dong goes through all these lines, underlining them in pencil, reciting them three times each. Dick’s dialogue is odd – a series of non sequiturs that mostly go unanswered. Not really dialogue at all. Dick doesn’t do conversation. Right at the end, the person whose name Dick asks for – an anonymous foot soldier – doesn’t even get the chance to step out from his hiding place and speak before Dick dies. Naturally a vigilante who goes around shooting public pissers has to die, but it makes Lu Dong sad to see him end this way. It feels tragic. Hi, my name’s Dick, what’s your name? He reads it twice more, finds the rhythm of the line. No sorrow at his life ending. He just wants to understand this man. What’s your name? Lu Dong stands before the mirror, staring at his own face. What’s your name? He makes one corner of his lip twitch up, keeps his eyebrows level, tries to look composed. This is how he’ll do it. All of a sudden, he feels he can do the performance justice, or at least this line, his interpretation makes sense, and if someone were to call action right now, he’s confident everyone would be satisfied with the take.

His phone pings. Zhang Yu:

 

Just back from swimming. These questions aren’t easy to answer. You know me, if I could think clearly I wouldn’t make movies. Forgive me, but actually I’m not sure these questions are important. If you think they are, then please take responsibility for them. I’ll give you a tip though: you don’t hate your target, but rather you’ve thought about it rationally and have decided that the world would be a better place if he didn’t exist. You’re not a foot soldier, because foot soldiers always take the country’s side. You’re someone who rearranges the world all by yourself, like the great Lei Feng, not bound by ethics, a small-time intellectual. Take care.

 

Lu Dong responds with an OK and thumbs up emoji. He thinks he understands.

That evening, Yiduo comes home bearing a toy gun with a scope, though no tripod, and the scope is merely decorative, all he can see through it is gray plastic, while the bullets are plastic orange pellets. You could shoot someone in the face with these and not injure them. In other words, the gun is as harmless as a ping-pong ball dispenser, but at least it has a trigger. A little later, they take Lu Fan out for pizza. She loves Western food and can polish off half a nine-inch pizza and a fillet steak all by herself, but she’s not fat. It’s as if she was born with the ability to transform Western food into water and carbon dioxide. Back at home, Lu Dong tells his daughter the story of the tyrannosaurus rex, a carnivore who falls into a deep gully where there’s nothing to eat. A fox falls in love with him and gathers fruit for him each day, and he survives. When the T-rex finally gets out and returns to the forest he goes back to eating other animals, but whenever he encounters a fox he hesitates and flips a coin to decide if he should eat it. Most of the time, the coin gives him the outcome he desires.

For the next few days, Lu Dong rehearses by himself, taking care of his daughter at night so Yiduo can finish up her work. He wakes up at six each morning to make breakfast for his wife and child. At night, after Lu Fan has gone to bed, he goes downstairs for a jog around the compound in an attempt to reduce the excess flesh on his body and face. Dick only smokes half a pack a day, so Lu Dong does the same. Never more or less, ten cigarettes exactly. Now and then he feels a surge of desire for his lover, but the task ahead of him quickly tamps that down. For the first time in five years his feelings are more or less pure. A week later, he knows all Dick’s lines by heart, he has a plan for the blocking of each scene, and he’s come up with a gesture that isn’t in the script: before he fires his gun, Dick sticks his right index finger into his ear, then touches that same finger to the trigger. At least two of his meals each day are noodles, sometimes takeout, sometimes homemade. After the first week, he notices a tiny new restaurant by the T-junction that serves Shanxi noodles. Their cleanliness is only so-so but the noodles are tasty, and so he begins going there at lunchtime for a bowl of knife-cut noodles. On the tenth night, he dreams of Dick lurking behind a window in the distance, taking aim while he pees by the side of the road. Dick touches his finger to his ear and shoots him dead.

A beautiful nightmare.

On the twenty-third day, as if making a daily visit to church, Lu Dong lies prone on his balcony. The man in the blue jacket appears again at the compound gate. Lu Dong aims the toy gun at his head. A nanny returns from buying groceries and uses her keycard to enter the compound, and the man slips in behind her. Today he is carrying a red rucksack. He walks over to one of the benches by the pond and sits down, gazing around, staring at the koi in the water. It’s a sunny day and the pond is glittering. The man sits there quite a while, then seems to remember something, and reaches into his rucksack for a baseball cap, which he puts on, casting a shadow over his face. Lu Dong points the gun at the center of the cap. The man folds his arms and stares into space. A few residents bring their children to play by the pond. The kids point at the water and seem to say something. One of them sticks a leg in and his mother smacks him. Someone tosses breadcrumbs to the koi, who surge over to snap them up, like petals on a flower. Lu Dong is getting thirsty but stays put. He thinks to himself, if you don’t move, neither will I. A half-hour passes. A nanny in her forties pushes a stroller up to the pond. In the stroller is a set of twins, each sleeping in their own little seat. Lu Dong has never seen this nanny or this stroller. Probably the family just moved in, or the babies were born recently. Not talking to anyone, the nanny parks the stroller by the water and settles onto a bench to bask in the sun. Time passes. A boy drops his water pistol into the pond and the wind blows it into the center. Several parents come over but they aren’t able to retrieve it. The nanny stands and seems to be suggesting something. At this moment, the man in the baseball cap quickly walks over to the stroller, places something onto one of the seats, and briskly leaves through the gate.

A bomb? Lu Dong is about to shout down at them but shakes his head. What if it’s not a bomb? What if it’s a flyer for an early education center? Shyness and anxiety do battle in his heart. Finally he gets up, changes into a clean shirt, and takes the elevator down. By the time he gets to the lake there is no sign of the nanny or the twins. The little boy’s father is scooping up the water pistol with a pool skimmer. Lu Dong looks up at his balcony, where the gun is still propped up and pointing in this direction. He leaves through the gate and makes a round of the perimeter, but there is no sign of the man. Could he have dozed off ? Maybe everything he just saw was a dream. At the supermarket, he buys a pack of cigarettes: A pack of Esse cigarettes, please. Green, not blue. No, not that one, give me the one third row down, fifth from the left. The clerk says, What? Lu Dong thinks maybe he didn’t hear and repeats the entire line. The clerk says, Sir, we’re out of Esse. Look, the shelf’s empty. Lu Dong nods and gets some chewing gum instead.

Back home he sits in the study, puts some eyedrops in his eyes, shuts them, and has a rest. Time for noodles, he thinks, but he’s a little tired, and all of a sudden he misses Lu Fan. If only she could show up now and say she’s back early because something happened at kindergarten. Now he understands that concentration equals loneliness. He opens his eyes and returns to the balcony. The nanny and twin stroller are back by the pond. He senses the tick tick of a timer. He ought to have eliminated that man earlier, he realizes. What a slip-up. This could be a micro-bomb, no thicker than a human hair. Or something even more advanced, a see-through bomb. You’d never spot that before it exploded, yet it might be powerful enough to decimate an entire building. He should have known, from the first moment he set eyes on the man, that he was the sort who brings wickedness to the world. Lu Dong was the only one who noticed, and now he’s let him get away.

He checks the time on his phone and sees a text from Zhang Yu’s production manager:

 

Director Zhang Yu drowned while swimming at three o’clock this afternoon. The film has been canceled, and your contract is now invalid. More details to follow. We are all shocked and saddened. Legal proceedings against the swimming pool have begun. Our condolences. Be well.

 

It’s six o’clock. Lu Dong calls Yiduo but she doesn’t pick up. Then he remembers she’s taken Lu Fan to her piano lesson, and is having dinner with some of the other parents. His heart judders like an airplane plummeting, plummeting, still not reaching the ground. He thinks to himself, This is a you problem, not a me problem. Know the difference. Maybe one day my problems will become your problems, but you should pray that day never comes. And another problem, the timer in his head is still going tick tick, not pausing for a second. He steps out onto the balcony. The sun is beginning to set, and there are more people gathering downstairs – children, adults, dogs, people with kites, skateboards, water pistols shaped like animal heads. He sees the nanny sitting next to the twin stroller, one leg hoisted onto the other, snacking on melon seeds from her handkerchief. The man in the baseball cap is on a nearby bench, still wearing his red rucksack, hands clasped, head lowered. Lu Dong goes into the kitchen and gets a knife, a couple of handspans long with a sharp point. He wraps this in newspaper, tucks it under his arm, and gets the elevator down. By the time he’s reached the pond the man is nowhere to be seen. Whirling around, he spots the man walking out of the compound gate. Lu Dong swats the handkerchief out of the nanny’s hand and says, There’s something in your stroller, get the kids out quick. With that he chases after the man, but there’s no sign of him. He remembers that he first saw him approach from the T-junction and heads that way, pausing a few seconds when he reaches the noodle shop, or rather where the noodle shop used to be, it’s gone now, in its place a roller shutter with a microscope painted on it.

Lu Dong sprints through the crowds surging up from the subway station and catches up with the man in the middle of the intersection. He knocks him to the ground. Lu Dong puts the point of the knife to his throat and says, What did you put in the stroller? The man says, What stroller? The twins’ stroller, Lu Dong says, And another thing, where did the noodle shop go? What noodle shop? Lu Dong says, There used to be one on the street back there, where’d it go? Oh, you mean the Shanxi noodle place, the man says, I’ve been wondering that too. Lu Dong sticks a finger into his ear with his free hand, allowing the knife point to skate across the man’s throat. Don’t change the subject. What did you put in the stroller? A rag doll, the man says. What’s inside it? Lu Dong says. Rags, obviously. An Audi speeds by, honking loudly. Why did you put the rag doll in there? I miss my children, the man says. That’s why I did it. I have two daughters, but I know something’s wrong with me, something unforgivable, and I’ll never see them again. Go ahead and stab me dead, solve all my problems, though you’ll only be creating problems for yourself. Lu Dong abruptly feels air swirling up from his chest, leaving through his mouth, his nose, his ears, while at the same time his flesh creeps downwards. A weightless distant spirit takes hold of his legs, and he can’t stop himself from falling over. He drops the knife and sits beside the man amid the flowing traffic, and he looks up into the distance where perhaps someone is taking aim at him, judgment for all the wrongs he’s done since he was born. But so what? The man pats him on the shoulder and says, You take life too seriously, don’t you? Lu Dong says nothing. He can see a river not far from here, rippling beneath the thronging twilit crowds, the water completely clear, fish darting through it, lush with aquatic plants, no thought of sluice gates, no fear of bullets, flowing all the way to the vast ocean.

    "text": "In the years before his stroke, just how many times had her father told a woman he loved her after dating for two or three weeks? He said it to her cat the moment he set eyes on it, when she took it out of the carrier on one of her visits. ‘I love you, cat’. The word that most surprised her, when he first used it, shortly after becoming a widower, was ‘sweetheart’. He’d never called his wife that; their romantic language had matured with time, and he never employed any of their usual terms of endearment with anyone else. The women he began to date were ‘sweethearts’ from the start and he even used it to refer to Adriana on the phone. ‘How are you doing, sweetheart?’ ‘Hugs and kisses, sweetheart!’ She felt like one of his online partners and wondered how many hours he spent on his cell phone for it to become a habit to call even his daughter ‘sweetheart’.

During those years, her father had interminable conversations with women. Whole mornings, afternoons, evenings, and sometimes even nights were spent offloading the story of his life into the ears of these women, some of whom appeared on Meetic profiles with their heads cropped so they wouldn’t be recognized. In addition to ‘sweetheart’, there was the ‘This time I think I’ve found the one for me’. ‘What’s-her-name is a darling, I think she’s the one for me,’ he’d told Adriana on ten, twenty, thirty occasions, with the phone or computer at hand, ready to start a new conversation with the next headless woman. ‘Just in case,’ he always replied when she objected to the contradiction involved in saying he’d found the one for him and then immediately linking up with someone else.

What does ‘I love you’ mean? What did he mean by it? Soon those words, uttered as casually as you might say, ‘Take care of yourself’ or pinch the chubby cheeks of the neighbor’s baby, began to litter more intimate conversations. None of those online attachments had lasted: when he didn’t break things off with them, the women broke off with him. ‘Have you split up with Menganita?’ Adriana would ask. ‘Oh, don’t mention her! What a pain she was!’ he’d answer, or ‘What a busybody!’ or ‘That one? I’m better off without her’ or ‘We have almost nothing in common’ or even ‘She’s a simple-minded woman with little experience of life.’ And then there were the ‘We have nothing to talk about’ and the ‘I found her really boring’. But not long before, in a kind of shallow expression of devotion, he’d told those women he loved them. It wasn’t that he was intentionally lying; those I-love-yous expressed a hope, the possibility of loving that person in the future. The majority of them had played along, taking things just as lightly, as if by a certain age they’d become immune, or were harking back to old-fashioned ways of hooking up, when words of love functioned as common euphemisms for sexual encounters.

He’d started dating the middle-aged women he met on Meetic as a slightly befuddled way of ensuring old age wouldn’t find him alone, particularly when he was experiencing a sudden, happy, second youth. He had nineteen partners in four years; his ‘partners’ were anyone he’d been with for more than a month. That was part of his happiness. The story wasn’t that he was desperately seeking someone to be with and had tried nineteen times, but that he’d dated all those ‘girls’. He called them girls, a word that was totally juvenile, just like his own soul.

He waited a whole summer before cutting loose, the exact amount of time that Adriana spent with him in Valencia after her mother’s death. Her funeral had been held on July 9, under a scorching sun, and seeing him so vulnerable for the first time, she’d decided to stay until the end of September. Three depressing months of cloying Mediterranean humidity that they spent looking at photos and arranging for family members and her mother’s friends to come choose items of clothing. Well, in fact, she was the one dividing up belongings while her father was driving around the city on a Vespa at sunset, whenever there was a bit of a breeze. The only area he took charge of was organizing the paperwork during interminable mornings of bureaucracy. They each made a will to avoid problems if the other died. At night they went to some small beachfront chiringuito, although Adriana was irritated by the number of people the cruise ships had been disgorging in recent years into a city that, during her childhood and adolescence, hadn’t been on the tourism map. Back then, Malvarrosa had had a scruffy, dilapidated air she’d loved. But it had been a long time since the former spa hotel of Las Arenas, with all its simple elegance, was converted into a flashy beachside complex and the whole esplanade had become a succession of packed terrace bars serving mediocre food for guiris, as the foreign tourists were known, with sangria and loud, cheesy music.

The only thing her father did that summer was sign up on Meetic at the advice of a friend. He’d log on at night to chat for a while, but nothing more. No dates. He was still feeling too dazed by his widowhood and was seeking consolation in friends and his two older sisters, Asela and Piluca. They were retired, living in Santa Pola, near Alicante, and invited him to visit on weekends. Took him to lunch or dinner, or spent the day with him on the beach. Her father hated getting sand in his clothes and would stay in the chiringuito, watching the others take dips in the sea, roast in the sun, and apply high-protection sunscreen that left their skin as white as corpses. Adriana declined most of her aunts’ invitations. She’d figured one thing out: however much they wanted to, they were incapable of consoling one other, first because they each needed to grieve alone and then, more importantly, because the journey through mourning necessitated a common horizon, was a shared project, and that was impossible; she had her boring life as a PhD student with a scholarship at a Madrid university, and her father was throwing himself into, as they say, remaking his life, which implied meeting someone in a similar situation with the desire to confront the final stretch with company, as he definitely didn’t want to face that stage alone. The only way he could find meaning in things, in himself, was through sharing his days with a woman. He used to talk to her at great length about it, perhaps believing that doing so would ensure a positive outcome. His task now, he insisted, was to meet a sensible person, capable of commitment. The repetition left room for skepticism since what is taken as a given doesn’t need to be alluded to so frequently. And, in fact, her father didn’t take anything for granted; there was an underlying sense of doubt. She didn’t know if his misgivings stemmed from fear of not complying with his own plans, from not trusting them or himself, or from the fact that he simply hadn’t yet come to terms with the death of his wife.

The fun and games started in October. She was back in Madrid and her father began emailing her photos of the women he was flirting with or dating. ‘What do you think to this one?’ he’d ask. Then they both bought smartphones and downloaded WhatsApp so it was her cell phone rather than her Gmail inbox that was filled with images of women in their late fifties and early sixties. It was important to him that she give the thumbs-up to the person’s physique, not so much in terms of a slender figure, beautiful eyes, or gym-sculpted muscles, but something more subtle in the whole look, as if an infallible capacity for commitment – his obsession – could be inferred from an impeccable appearance.

The first woman he dated was Quela, a widow from Massanassa who owned orange orchards and gave Adriana a bracelet; in her free time, the woman made jewelry from pieces of wood, shells and zircon. She never saw her again because her father broke off the relationship after a few weeks, arguing that she had a jealous streak. Then came the slightly younger Araceli, who lived in Sagunto and was the spitting image of Jacqueline Kennedy. Her father broke off that too, this time because it was impossible to go out to restaurants with her – she hated all the dishes and hardly spoke a word. She was followed by Mari Carmen, Amparo, Roser and Delfina, all from Valencia, all blonde and standoffish, and none of whom lasted more than a month. They left him before he tired of them. For his next date, he went farther afield, to the home of a certain Nines in Castellón, where he planned to spend five days. Nines was a head taller than her father and twice his weight. In her photo, she looked on the large side, had dyed red hair and was wearing purple lipstick and eyeshadow. Nines, who was also widowed, introduced him to her children, made plans for his vacations, loaned him an SUV, and firmly believed that she’d found the man she wanted to end her days with. Somewhat overwhelmed, he soon set her straight on that point. And then she stalked him. When her father blocked her calls and emails, Nines found Adriana’s Facebook page and left messages for her: ‘Your father is the man for me’; ‘No woman could ever love him more than I do.’

Adriana was surprised that people in their sixties still had romantic illusions, that women with children and marriages behind them could believe it possible to be in love with someone after knowing them for five days. Or was it a kind of regression? Maybe desperation led them to unlearn, to deny everything experience had taught them. Was it possible not to learn anything? Maybe there was absolutely nothing to learn. That idea was spine-chilling. Or maybe it was just Nines; all the others had a more realistic sense of what love was. Usually, there was practicality on both sides: they were looking for company, friendship, but there was no form of passion or sentimentality involved, just a mutual checking out. Moreover, he tended to avoid what he called the ‘unbalanced’ ones: women who were over-the-top in some way, excessively bad-humored, excessively sporty, excessively sensitive. He had no regrets about dropping Nines, nor Lourdes, her successor, who said she was separated from her husband but still lived in the same house as him, and who then moved into her father’s apartment without ever being invited. One night, she cooked croquettes for him and her father got a bad stomachache. Adriana’s aunt Piluca called her immediately:

‘The woman is trying to poison him!’

That episode made him more cautious. He continued meeting all the Nurias, Cristinas, Ángeles, Lauras and Consuelos who were happy to have a beer with him, but if it went beyond that, he’d wait weeks before inviting them home. If he particularly liked the woman, he’d suggest a weekend in some nearby hotel.

Although he still kept her regularly updated on his connections, Adriana lost track. During her visits, she’d sit behind him at the computer to look at all those ‘beheadeds’, as she called them, although, in fact, as he explained, they were in the minority: he knew from experience that only the ones who were married or shy hid their faces, and he’d stopped dating them, which didn’t stop her from continuing to call them all ‘beheadeds’ just to bug him.

She wasn’t concerned about his juvenile lifestyle. He’d spent the last years diligently caring for his beloved, ailing wife, and before that, over thirty years taking orders from that same sergeant-major of a wife, with equal parts diligence and unconditional love. It had never occurred to him that he’d survive her. A constant source of irritation for Adriana, though, was the amount of money he was spending. In just a few months, he’d gone through his modest savings; sometimes he didn’t have enough to see him through the month and would have to ask one of his sisters for a loan. ‘What if something happens to you? You’ve got nothing to fall back on,’ Adriana began to say. ‘What if the air conditioning breaks down, or the television, or your car, or all of them give up the ghost at the same time?’ she’d protest at each visit. ‘When I win my case against Social Security and they pay my full pension, I’ll be more comfortable,’ he’d reply. ‘And I’ve cut down on a lot of expenses, but I need to find a partner.’ ‘And can’t these women pay their share? They have their own money. Fuck it, this is the twentieth century. Why do you have to come off all manly?’ Her father would shrug his shoulders, which for him was equivalent to an absolute refusal, even if he did know he was in the wrong. He was about to turn seventy and came from a generation where men had to pay to seduce, particularly on the first date. And that was the problem: he rarely got past the first date. When she reminded him of that, he’d be despondent because not only was he leaking money like water, but it was also confirmation of his advancing years.

The apartment had gradually become a labyrinth.

It was large, very old-fashioned, and cluttered with things inherited from her mother’s side of the family: tapestries, rugs, revolving bookcases, ceramicware from all around the peninsula, several boxes of antique silver cutlery, porcelain dinner services, huge crystal chandeliers, paintings, prints, African carvings, Lladró figurines, wall clocks, chairs, armchairs, occasional tables, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves in three rooms containing the complete library of the only ancestor with intellectual pretensions, who died celibate, having accumulated enough culture for several generations. The whole place was an expression of horror vacui; it needed constant attention, which had formerly been provided by Teresa, who came to clean. Now, whenever Adriana happened to be there on one of her days, Teresa would take her aside to say, ‘Can’t you persuade your father to throw out some of the papers in his study? It’s impossible to tidy in there!’ Or, ‘Can’t you persuade him to clear out the attic, take the rugs to be cleaned, dust the chandeliers, to at least throw something out?’ Her father was having none of it. Adriana knew Teresa was wondering why she didn’t do it, why his daughter didn’t use her visits to bring a little order to the chaos. But she’d already thrown out enough stuff when her mother died, had spent whole months clearing the junk rooms, donating books to libraries, listing white elephants on Wallapop, until she’d had more than enough, and her aunts advised her that she shouldn’t go around cheerfully offloading things that, according to them, were very valuable. ‘Why don’t you have them auctioned?’ they said. ‘You’ll need the money,’ a distant cousin warned one day. There was a hint of vengeance in her words. They could no longer count on her mother’s generous salary as a pediatrician. What’s more, although Adriana doubted the value of all those possessions, something was holding her back. She was done with breaking her back. She resolved to do as little as possible, but then the embolism came along, multiplying the number of things she had to take charge of, leaving even less time for all the paintings, tapestries, fabrics, dinner services, silverware, books and counterpanes belonging to great-grandmothers and their mothers, and the mountain of papers, and the cluttered junk rooms. Her father’s health became her main, and at times only, concern. Lady Death and Lady Manipulator – two deities of the darkness that had begun to surround her during her mother’s illness – took all her energy, and then she felt like those devices that control people’s activities, giving a warning whenever they stray from a healthy lifestyle: ‘You haven’t worked out for two weeks’; ‘Your blood pressure is higher’; ‘Your pulse is faster today’; ‘Have you taken your medication?’; ‘Have you stopped smoking?’ Yet, not even after his stroke did her father think about death, or the possibility that he might not fully recover. But he did, on the other hand, think about how hard it was going to be to find a partner now that he had one useless hand, a walker, and a pace not much faster than a snail’s."

    "text": "Time seems to slip by without leaving even the slightest trace on her body. There is no way of guessing her age, but her thin, supple body, glowing white skin, and clearly defined features all make her look like a young woman still in the prime of her youth. The most telling details lie in her expression – that mildly amused look so common among young girls. The edges of her mouth tilt slightly upwards, as do her eyes, that’s one of the reasons her expression is so distinctive. Her face is nearly devoid of wrinkles; even when she smiles the skin on her face remains smooth and even, with the exception of a hint of crow’s feet. But even those tiny lines seem to accentuate the natural curvature of her eyes, increasing her allure. There is nothing aged about her appearance – she doesn’t even seem to have fully matured – she looks more like a girl in the spring of youth. It is hard to believe. Could she really be that young? There is something about her that gradually reveals the passage of time. Once those tiny details emerge, they quickly multiply. Beneath her supple body, glowing skin, and perfectly manicured appearance there is something frozen and fixed. It is difficult to express. Nothing changes, but it is as if more and more is added to her, layer upon layer. Who knows? Perhaps at some point her appearance will actually begin to transform. That’s why, while everyone repeatedly remarks ‘how young she looks’, between the lines, what they are saying is that her youth has passed.

There is no way of guessing her real age; it’s impossible to tell. She is obviously past the age most women get married – she clearly passed that point a long time ago. This is clear because there is something pure and simple about her – there is no trace of passion left. This purity is frozen and therefore very different from the purity one sees in a young girl. A young girl’s purity is chaotic, tangled, prickly, overflowing from all kinds of unfamiliar experiences. After a certain number of years, that youthful purity hardens, eventually transforming into something resembling a fossil. It is from the preserved youthful appearance of someone like her that the ravages of time are seen clearly, even more clearly than on a face with typical signs of aging. Those fluid elements also reveal a kind of vitality and over time they gnaw away at one’s muscles and skin, transforming the face’s makeup and shape. They also bring a kind of ugliness, but that imbues the person with a livelier personality. This kind of personality always has the qualities of youth. It is due to the restless nature of youth that one’s appearance is twisted, contorted, and left coarse.

It would be wrong to say she hasn’t experienced life. Instead, it would be more apt to describe her as someone whom time has slipped by without leaving the slightest trace. She has always grown, but never seemed to really grow up. When she crooks her head to the side as she pops dried banana chips or dried orange slices into her mouth, she still seems like a young girl. The way the corners of her eyes and mouth curl up when she smiles makes her look like a teenager. Her pitch black hair, devoid of even a single strand of gray, hangs straight down to her waist, and is kept in place by an oversized handkerchief, which is loosely tied. If she’s a young girl, she’s an old fashioned one; this was the fashion for young girls who came from humble family circumstances roughly twenty years ago. The style was everywhere, indoors and out, in the longtang alley neighborhoods and out on the main boulevards. It was a style that developed partially out of laziness. She may be a young girl, but a young girl from two decades past. Whenever she goes out, she always applies a few sprays of perfume to her handkerchief, fan, and behind her ears. When she attends lavish events, she wears a black, silk cheongsam and a pair of high-heeled shoes which extend her petite frame, accentuating her long, slender figure. A crimson shawl embroidered with peach blossoms and a small handbag inlaid with pearls give her the appearance of a virtuous maiden reincarnated from another world. She swims through the sea of time, never resisting its current. Resistance would have left behind scars. This is another reason why time has left no scratch on her.

However, despite appearances, she hasn’t emerged from a fairytale. She attended elementary school, middle school, graduated during the Cultural Revolution, and was unemployed for a period of time before finally finding a job as a bookkeeper for a kindergarten. These historical periods more or less reveal her true age. But who would ever believe that? The difference between her real age and her perceived one is several decades. No one ever dares ask her to her face, but behind her back they are constantly whispering to one another: How old is she? If she ever happens to overhear them she always turns and, with a smile, declares: I’m an old lady! There is something unreconcilable between her smile and an old lady’s; it feels so unnatural, yet there is something that leaves you with no choice but to believe what she says is true. Frankly, there is something dark and strange about this smiling ‘old lady’. But things are often strange like that. In situations like this, it seems to no longer be an issue of whether or not she is young or pretty, it is something else . . . but what that could be is not clear.

No one understands anything about her life; that’s not because of the complexity of her lifestyle, but the opposite – its overly simplistic nature. It is so simple that it is almost beyond comprehension. She has always lived with just one other person – her mother. The identity of her father – whether he passed away or left them, and, if he had left them, where he had gone – is a mystery that no one knows the answer to. And no one cares to ask. Back during that era, the early 1950s, things could have gone either way. Whatever happened was likely a product of the times, a moment of revolutionary change, where it was quite common for families to have both heads chopped off. In those crowded old-style longtang neighborhoods, how many confused children growing up in single-parent homes had the urge to search for their missing parents?

But she did have a mother, so what about her? Most would say that a mother-daughter living together was a nice, small family unit – simple, stable, and peaceful. The daughter had someone to raise her when she was a child and the mother would have someone to care for her when she grew old. Without the constant bickering of a husband and wife, or sibling rivalries, the relationship between a mother and daughter takes on a sisterly dynamic – they are perfect companions for each other.

Indeed, her mother looks more like her older sister than her actual mother. She too has a slender, petite body, alluring eyes, and a fair complexion. The way she dresses is also quite appealing. And, just like her daughter, she too looks much younger than her age. However, given a certain period has past, the accumulation of time has pushed down on that frozen core inside her to the point that her external appearance has finally changed. This change manifests itself with a tendency to shrink and contract, and not with growing thin or developing wrinkles; her skin remains clear and well-cared for, but slightly darkened and not as radiant as before. Her mother is better read than her and, if nothing else, she experienced the changes a woman goes through when she gets married and has children; these are experiences that transform time’s quality and leave their mark. This is why her mother’s eyes reveal a worldliness and the relaxed sensibility of someone finally at home with herself after everything she has experienced. This alone gives her a dimension her daughter is lacking. It also explains why she is, ever so slightly, better looking than her daughter. But when it comes down to it, mother and daughter are quite similar – after all they share the same genes and same detached air that allows their experience to leave less of an mark on them than most people. Mother may indeed be an old lady, but a youthful one; both pretty and lively. Next to her daughter, they were indeed like sisters.

Mother and daughter even dressed in almost identical fashion. As a little girl, her mother dressed her up as a delicate young maiden, braiding her long hair and putting it up in a bun. She wore a camel-wool cotton-padded jacket with woven brocade sleeves and toggle buttons, which her mother made from leftover scraps of fabric. She matched her jacket with her mother’s old Savile Row-style trousers, which her mother had altered, by widening the ankles with a patch of cowhide. The look was completed with a pair of leather shoes with faux-squirrel fur around the opening. When mother and daughter went out together, they were the image of two elegant women. By the time she was thirteen or fourteen, she was already as tall as her mother and had begun to develop her own opinions about the world. Mother and daughter began to visit the silk shop where, after much haggling, they would return home with all the materials to make new clothing. When it came to ready-made outfits, the two of them would pick out clothes with only slight variations so they would match whenever they went out together. During this period of her life, her style was a bit old-fashioned, but only because she was imitating her mother’s. This phase lasted long into her teenage years. That was back during the days of the Cultural Revolution when the prevalent street fashion veered towards the rustic; those peasant and worker uniforms of the day came off as a bit dramatic. It was popular for girls at the time to wear male-style military outfits such as wide-legged trousers, leather belts, and shirts buttoned all the way up to the collar. Mother and daughter resembled refugees of time who had been locked away in a small garret since the last century. They made slight adjustments to their trousers, widening their pant legs to the accepted six inches. They also removed the lace and embroidery from their shirts, eliminating all the symbols of decadence and rot from their old-style clothing. Yet they managed to find a way to express their sense of fashion in private. At the time, there were all kinds of embroidery styles, like the Albanian stitch, being quietly passed around. As soon as they came home, mother and daughter would ascend to the garret and remove their outer garments to reveal brightly colored sweaters with unique patterns. Gradually, their true age began to blur and fade; you could describe them as ‘gorgeous’ or a ‘pair of beauties’, but they were outdated, out of step with the era they lived in. This was especially the case for her. This was, after all, her era. And yet, not only did she fail to keep up with what was happening, but regressed into the past. By this time, she had graduated high school; it was probably the time in which young students were all mobilized up to the mountains and down to the countryside as part of the Rustication Movement, yet mother and daughter never considered it. Knowing that this widowed mother and only child had only each other, her school and the neighborhood committee didn’t press hard to separate them; instead, her name was added to the list awaiting employment allocation. In any case, her mother already had a job as a cashier at the district food company and they never felt that living off her mother’s single salary was a burden. During the period that she was waiting for employment, mother and daughter became obsessed with crocheted lace. Every season, everyone was granted a yarn coupon to purchase four balls of string or yarn. They would trade some of their other ration coupons, such as their fish coupons, meat coupons, egg coupons, and even grain coupons for more yarn coupons. It was lucky that they were both slight and neither had a strong appetite. The cotton would be transformed into crochet tea towels, tablecloths, sofa covers, and gloves; they were always exchanging lace patterns with one another. She even crocheted a buttonless black top with wide sleeves and a Mandarin collar that could be worn over a shirt during the spring and autumn months, showing off the shirt’s patterns through the black lace, which was quite stylish for that era. The wild, restless days of her teenage years were in fact spent rather peacefully, even as chaos raged throughout society, leaving behind an entire house filled with crocheted clothes and decorations. One look at them was enough to reveal the chaos and luxury of that era. But since most of the articles were white, they always maintained a kind of purity. Later, she ended up being assigned to a local kindergarten where, coincidently, she ended up handling their bookkeeping, just like her mother. By this time, it was the mid-1970s and the Cultural Revolution was already in its final years, and fashion had finally returned to a sense of the everyday. By this time, she had grown into a bona-fide woman. Her clothes no longer felt old-fashioned; they were just right. Her fashion sense was considered conservative with a bit of flash; just as the seasons changed from late winter to early spring, for instance, she wore a pastel wool coat, a red and green scarf around her neck, navy wool pants, and a pair of short leather boots. She wore her hair in two long braids, which were held together with an acrylic hairpin. By then, her fashion sense was rather measured. She no longer had the anxious sensibility she had when she was younger; now her look was more cosmopolitan and quite contemporary.

It was during those years that she and her mother truly stood out on streets of the city. Her mother looked just like her, but they were set apart by their hairstyles. Her mother wore hers in a single braid looped around her forehead and secured with a hairpin. Then, by the late 1970s, when things started to really open up, her mother began wearing her hair as a bun, which she secured with a hairnet. She, on the other hand, opted to keep her hair in a ponytail. By this point, her age was finally beginning to catch up with her fashion, sometimes even surpassing it. However, both mother and daughter’s fashion seemed to stand the test of time. It was similar to playing the female qingyi role in traditional Chinese opera, where a good actor could play the same role from youth through to old age. In some ways, she seemed younger than before. And as the national mood continued to relax, mother and daughter added something new to their arsenal – makeup. Initally they applied each other’s makeup, but began to do their own once they’d got the hang of it. They would each sit before the old-fashioned vanity with three mirror panels, and apply their foundation, draw their eyebrows, and paint on eyeliner, making sure to add a slight upward curve at the edge of their eyes. They would purse their lips as they accentuated the corner of their mouths. The final touch would be powder to set their makeup. At this time, skirts came back into style. They both loved wearing skirts, especially long ones that went down to the ankle. In winter, they would wear wool skirts paired with ankle books to conceal the cuffs of the cotton pants they wore underneath. Only when velvet tights came into fashion did they begin to adjust their style. Skirts were much more versatile than pants; they could wear all different types of sweaters and jackets, which could make a look much more refined. They would finish it off with a long coat with an upturned collar. Once ready, they would descend, out the door, off to dance.

Usually they went to those neighborhood dance halls, or dance parties held in abandoned factories frequented by middle-age people. Admission prices were low and everyone conducted themselves like perfect ladies and gentlemen. They also attended social dances organized by their workplaces, which were also quite orderly and devoid of any strange people or drama. Neither of them ever brought a date; they just danced with each other. They were in perfect harmony, always complimenting one another’s moves regardless of the style of dance. Naturally, there were also times in which someone else would invite one of them to dance. Hidden in those adult dance halls, there were always a handful of middle-aged men who were true gentlemen from the old days. They would approach, bow ever so slightly, as if they were about to bend the knee, then take one of them by the hand and silently head onto the dance floor. Most of those dance floors were concrete, but the soles of their shoes tended to smooth them out over time. Both mother and daughter were light on their feet and let those gentlemen take the lead as they gracefully glided across the dance floor. When the song ended, it was back to the two of them dancing together. By the time the last song played it was usually not too late, maybe 10:30 p.m. or 11:00 p.m., and they would put on their jackets and head outside, to follow the twists and turns of the neighborhood streets and longtang alleys back home.

They lived in the garret-style pavilion of an old-style longtang apartment with two north-facing windows and a back window facing the patio; it was actually a double pavilion that was almost twice as large as the typical garret. They’d lived here ever since she was born. They shared a bathroom with the people on the second floor, and the kitchen was just outside the front door. Near the corner of the stairway was a gas stove, referred to as a ‘turtle head’, which they could use to boil water and cook. One would think their apartment would have been sparsely decorated, but it was actually filled with rosewood Western-style furniture, which was adorned with crocheted fabric covers of the time. The entire place had an elegant, feminine atmosphere. Mother and daughter gradually became obsessive about cleaning and managed to keep their twelve-or-thirteen-square-meter room free from even a single speck of dust. Who could have even imagined another world had existed within their small garret apartment – the paint peeling off the wall, the doors and windows rotten to the point that they are almost falling off their frames. In the summer they used cattail leaf fans whose edges were rolled with fine hemp rope and handles wrapped in thin strips of bamboo then bound with silk rope; the fans hung on the hook behind the closet door in the place usually reserved for men’s hats or ties. The hot water bag with the cover they had sewn from scraps of cloth was only used in winter – during the summer months it was stored in the bottom drawer of a large chest. Beside it was a tin container with buttons they had removed from old clothes, a bundle of sewing needles, and a tin chocolate box. The chocolate long eaten, the box now contained an assortment of random items – empty perfume bottles, which were now of no use but they couldn’t bear to throw them away, and three or four very rare New Year’s cards from a distant relative. He’d sent a few seemingly on a whim, but never bothered sending more. Every year when they did their big spring cleaning, they would think about whether or not to throw those cards away, but they would always push the decision back to the following year, just replacing the paper lining in the drawer and putting everything back where it had been. They used to line the drawers with old newspaper since they’d heard the smell of ink was a natural moth repellent. But when stiffer and smoother calendar paper became available, they replaced the paper lining at the bottom of every drawer with that instead, then also replaced the lining on the top of the cabinet. On top of the chest were a pair of abacuses, which mother and daughter both needed for their jobs, but they also served as their playthings. Back in the days before television, they would sit down with their abacuses after dinner and play various numbers games, seeing who could calculate various equations the fastest and with the greatest accuracy. Using three fingers on each hand, they would manipulate the upper and lower beads in a way that was both mesmerizing to watch and pleasing to the ear. Eventually, their abacuses were replaced with digital calculators and although they were no longer of any practical use, they continued playing their abacus games for a while before they gradually stopped. Instead, they began to watch television. Their old abacuses were relegated to the top of the chest. So there were changes in their lives, but they were soft, gentle changes rather than turbulent revolutions.

However, their apartment wasn’t as quiet as it seemed. They actually had quite a few regular visitors. Mother had one old friend – he was actually a distant relative – that she referred to as Brother Yun; her daughter called him Uncle Yun. He lived in the Pudong district of the city; back then people who lived in Pudong had a different accent. Whenever he came over he would bring snacks – sweet sorghum, steamed water chestnuts, homemake cakes, and, occasionally, he would bring something really special, like a full roasted hen – yellow beak, feet, and all. Mother refused to let him go home empty-handed, so she always filled his bag with treats of her own – cloud cakes, chicken crisps, and two jin of white cakes. Whenever he came over, they would sit down and reminisce about the past, such as that year when a fire broke out during someone’s funeral, or the time someone on Dongjiadu Road dressed up as a ghost to scam people out of their money – that guy scared the hell out of one woman. All of these stories sounded like typical gossip, but they somehow made the stories sound more serious. After hearing these kinds of rumors for so many years, their dark and tragic quality had faded; they were now simply another part of the everyday. During her days waiting to be assigned a job, Uncle Yun tried to set her up with a marriage prospect. The man was a technician who was five years older than her, a native of Pudong, and his family owned a house. By these measures, he should have been a good choice for her; after all, at the time she didn’t seem to have any other prospects. However, the simple fact that his family home was in Pudong put her off. She had grown up on the west side of the city, which was the more prosperous and cosmopolitan part of Shanghai – even if it meant living in a small north-facing room in an old alley neighborhood that froze in the winter, sweltered in the summer, and whose roof leaked during typhoon season, she still preferred it to Pudong. She was accustomed to her lifestyle; anywhere more than a few bus stops away was like an alien world. There were a few times during her middle school years where she’d been sent down to the countryside during autumn to participate in labor retreats in Fengxian, Songjiang, and Beixinjing. Before each trip, her mother prepared a backpack filled with underwear and safety pins; one of each for each day she was to be away. If the trip was for two weeks, there would be fourteen pairs of underwear and fourteen safety pins. Mother instructed her to change her underwear every day, wrapping the dirty pairs up and fastening them with a pin to take back home to wash – who knows how many thousands of different types of bacteria lived in the water in the countryside. The failed matchmaking attempt led to some tension between mother and Uncle Yun; she thought Uncle Yun was treating her daughter like some old maid that couldn’t find a husband. She didn’t realize just how many unemployed young women would have loved to have such an opportunity. It didn’t take long at all for that guy in Pudong to find a partner – the woman he ended up marrying was not only two years younger than her, but also came from a wealthy family. She didn’t want to be sent off to the countryside and marrying him allowed her to stay in Shanghai. When Uncle Yun came by to share the news with them, mother and daughter both smiled – neither seemed to have an ounce of regret.

Among their other frequent visitors were two or three of her old classmates from elementary school and middle school. They were all rather average girls with a similar disposition to her own and fairly indifferent to most things. But when they were together, they knew how to have fun. They would gossip about other girls, talk about what rumors they had heard spreading through the neighborhood, go to the local movie theater – they liked tragedies the best, that way they could all cry together. It would be growing dark by the time they emerged from the movie, some of the streetlights were just starting to turn on, and they would feel as if something inside them had been transformed. It would only be after they had walked a block or two from the theater that they gradually settled back into reality. After saying goodbye, she would stroll back down the alley where she lived and, as she arrived at the rear door, she would see the light on in the northern garret window, shining through the curtains embroidered with peach blossoms, projecting a series of flower shadows. The drama she had just watched on screen seemed to now be so very far away. When girls spent time together, they always ended up sharing some secrets with each other. During those days in which she was waiting to be assigned a job, she and her friends were all around eighteen or nineteen; how could they not think about marriage? But how could any of them dare to mention it? When they wanted to talk about it, they would instead share stories about other people. One such story was about a girl from some school who ended up getting knocked up by a married man. She bound her stomach tightly with a white cloth to conceal it, but one day while she was playing basketball at school, one of her classmates asked her why she was so fat. She erupted into a fit of anger, scolding her classmate for talking nonsense. There was another story about a pair of sisters from one of the local longtang neighborhoods; they were both in love with one of their cousins. The three of them spent all their time together, but their cousin couldn’t decide which one to be with – in the end, he married one of their classmates instead. These all felt like stories that could have come straight from a Jane Austen novel, with a touch of the vulgarity that comes with neighborhood gossip. There was something equally terrifying and thrilling about the way they privately gossiped about those taboo stories. Yet somehow those stories felt even more distant to her than the tragedies she saw playing out on screen at the movies. At the very least, the people and events displayed on the silver screen were in line with her aesthetic view of the world, whereas those other stories seemed completely unrelated to her. She was convinced that no such things could ever possibly happen to her – those were all extreme catastrophes, like a terrible disease, whereas her life was always a bastion of safety. Among this group of frequent visitors to their house there was one girl who was sent down to Anhui for re-education; another was assigned a job in a factory and no longer had time to spend with them; and then there was another girl – the one who first introduced them to the art of crochet lace – who continued to hang around for a while, but was also terribly anxious about getting assigned a job. They would often sit together, their heads practically touching, as they leaned over to crochet all kinds of designs. One would think they were extremely close with one another, but owing to their rather limited experience and simple lives, they were emotionally closed off. On a spiritual level, they were somewhat impoverished, and there wasn’t much for them to share with each other. That’s why they ended up spending all their time chatting about sewing and other trivial matters. By this time, there weren’t even any movies to see. It wasn’t long before that girl found herself a boyfriend and gradually stopped coming by their apartment.

Once she was assigned a job, she ended up getting along with one or two colleagues, but at her age it was already getting difficult to build a deeper relationship with new friends. She was very private, so her relationship with those new colleagues never evolved beyond the most pedestrian. That said, one of her colleagues did try setting her up with her brother-in-law and they actually went on a date! They met in a park one Sunday. They strolled the concrete paths, surrounded by the shrieks of playing children, and maintained enough distance that someone could have easily stood between them. It’s unclear if he ever even got a good look at her, she certainly didn’t get a good look at him – all she really took note of was his pair of triple-stich cap-toe black leather shoes and perfectly fitting tight nylon socks. What did they even talk about? He seemed to talk about his job as a technician at a metallurgical plant. Although she barely understood a thing he said, she didn’t necessarily find him boring. It wasn’t bad having someone near her, babbling on and on. At this point in her life she had begun to think it might be time for her to get married and settle down. However, after she got home and discussed everything with mother, she realized that if she married him her colleague would become her sister-in-law, which might make things at work complicated, so she turned him down. This kind of thing happened multiple times; there were always well-intentioned people who would cross the line by trying to set her up with various men. By then, she was past the ideal age for marriage; the ship of eligible bachelors had set sail. All of the men she was introduced to always had some kind of deficiency that made them unable to live up to her standards. Deep down she did want to get married, but she was in no rush, and in fact, it wasn’t something she spent very much thought on. Perhaps if she had been more focused on marriage, she would have been nervous, but after a few years, even that unconscious yearning faded.

Life was like a warm current of water flowing right past her. All of those whirlpools and undercurrents that might have otherwise swept her away simply slipped by without ever impacting her. Like when she was a little girl, she still shared a bed with her mother. It was a double bed, just four-and-a-half-feet wide. But neither of them took up much space. In fact, even after several decades the coir ropes supporting the mattress were still firm. There was only one or two occasions in which mother hired a neighborhood worker to replace a few of the coir ropes and tighten them up a bit. The bedspread used to be made from seersucker with red, blue, and yellow stripes but they later replaced it with a white poplin bedspread with an underlining embroidered with red strawberries. It was as if time stopped moving forward and was instead slipping back to the days of her childhood. Since they regularly waxed the furniture, the rosewood still glimmered with a healthy glow, as if new. Rosewood furniture also came back into fashion, especially that with Victorian-style carvings and patterns. It was as if contemporary style had suddenly stopped advancing. The ornamental covers on the furniture were a more recent trend and still in fashion. One new addition was a refrigerator with an ornamental handle decorated with pea-green and cranberry flowers; it added an extra layer of boudoir-style to their room. Over the past several years, they have replaced their television set several times. They started with a twelve-inch black-and-white set, then came a fourteen-inch color model, which they more recently swapped out for a twenty-five-inch flatscreen. They always kept the channel tuned to those Hong Kong and Taiwanese soap operas and every night, after they ate and did the dishes, mother and daughter would tune in to watch the latest episode of their favorite show. Together they would sigh, they would cry, but ultimately, they were watching those dramas with an air of indifference. Their lives were always so restrained, and because they consumed so very little, there was never anything to lose.

Every morning, mother had breakfast ready for her by the time she woke up; it was always something light, usually consisting of rice gruel, fermented tofu, or homemade bamboo shoots with beans. She washed her face and combed her hair in the sunlightless apartment. Their room was on the dark side of the garret and the vanity was situated against the wall between two north-facing windows. Without sunlight, whatever image was reflected in the mirror always appeared dark. But this was no issue, because the darkness masked her age; the reflection she saw in the mirror resembled a girl still in her twenties. Her skin was smooth, her hair a shiny black, and her eyes sparkled through the darkness. By the time she finished washing up, her rice gruel would already be growing cold. It was sitting on the table in a fine porcelain bowl with gold trim they had used for many years, bowls it would be impossible to find nowadays. The few out there are either cheap, unconvincing reproductions; poorly constructed from a coarse low-grade porcelain; or are those especially expensive and luxurious ones reserved for display during banquets. But none have that delicate homey quality of their porcelain set. After breakfast she would head off to work. They were fortunate that their traditional alley neighborhood somehow managed to avoid being targeted for demolition over the course of several urban reconstruction plans. The nearby roads were expanded and high-rise buildings went up all around their neighborhood, but somehow their traditional longtang remained untouched. That said, the people who lived in the neighborhood had changed quite a bit, especially those from her generation; most had married off or bought apartments elsewhere. There were some old-timers still hanging on in the neighborhood; they kept getting older, but since they were already old to begin with, they didn’t look much different from before. When they saw her strolling through the alleys they would affectionately greet her as ‘Meimei’ or ‘little sister’. There didn’t seem to be as many children in the neighborhood as before, when there used to be groups of them pouring out of every household. Nowadays they would only occasionally appear in groups of two or three, but only rarely. It was only in the mornings and evenings that the sounds of adults scolding their children, or kids arguing with their parents would ring out through the windows facing the courtyard. On rare occasions one could hear the sound of a baby crying. After a while, the cries would drift off and turn into babbling.

The bus she took to work changed its route several times. She used to be able to board it on the main road not far from the longtang, but later she needed to go to a stop on the small road behind her neighborhood, later that entire line was cancelled and she needed to take a different bus, which required multiple transfers. Eventually, she was able to take the subway. Strolling into the broad and brightly lit subway station waiting for the subway to rush towards her and stop at the platform, she could feel the progress of this era in which she lived; it was exciting. However, it wasn’t long at all before she gradually came to view all of that as perfectly natural; in fact, she could barely remember what the street even looked like before the subway station was built. All of those crowded little shops, apartments, primary schools, and noisy intersections were suddenly swallowed up by new thoroughfares as if they never even existed. All of those specialized items like peach crisps, salted candied dates, and roasted olives which used to be sold at southern goods market or the smoke shop were now all found together on the shelves of supermarkets. The pleasure involved in carefully selecting which item to buy along with the meticulous calculations involved were now swallowed by the process of bulk purchases. At first she felt as if she had lost her footing in this new world, but she quickly grew accustomed to things. There was actually something about taking entire bags of these products off the shelves that gave her a sense of affluence. While she didn’t have the kind of personality that actively pursued change, nor was she particularly tied to the past. She was someone who lived in the present moment; never thinking much about the past or the future, for the here and now was the only thing that was real.

The kindergarten where she worked had been relocated several times and even merged once or twice with other schools. Due to the One Child Policy, the number of children enrolled continued to decline until the point at which, approximately three years ago, her kindergarten had been converted into a retirement home. Throughout all of these changes, she continued to be the bookkeeper. Over the course of the past decade, the profession had become quite popular, and a great number of young women who’d already achieved advanced degrees began attending night schools for accounting. Most of those girls tried to work for those private or joint-venture companies, so as a bookkeeper working for a small neighborhood kindergarten, she wasn’t worried about facing competion. When it came to work, she was always meticulous, never made mistakes in her accounts, and kept her books extremely organized. Her entire professional life had been free of trouble or risk. If one were to insist upon her talking about the occupational hazards in her line of work, there were only one or two small examples that came to mind. One involved a bookkeeper who worked at a neighboring kindergarten, who was apparently a graduate of the famous Profit and Prosperity Accounting School. To please her boyfriend, she stole 170,000 RMB from the student meal fund – she was sentenced to death for her crime. This incident shook the entire early childhood educational system to its core. Even though she knew that she would never be capable of committing such a crime, she couldn’t help but feel anxious. Who knew? What if she were unconsciously making some mistake with one of the accounts? Thankfully she wasn’t the kind of person to get too anxious though, and that touch of anxiety quickly passed. The other hazard had to do with an article she read in the newspaper that claimed 10% of people diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases are accountants. The high ratio of infections was due to the fact that they frequently handled various banknotes, which, given their wide circulation, carry countless germs. This news terrified her, but the report also said that washing one’s hands could eliminate the risk of infection. From that point on, she was sure to wash her hands after touching any banknotes. She also made sure to wash her hands before and after going to the restroom and before and after eating. This allowed her to move through this minor crisis safely.

And just like that, her retirement was drawing near. Retirement also serves as a harsh warning, informing people that a certain amount of their time is up and life is about to entire a new phase. But this was no concern for her; after all, witnessing her mother’s life after retirement had already shown her what it was like. Her mother retired during her second year on the job – a change both mother and daughter greeted with relief. From that point forward they could bid farewell to their hectic lifestyle: the two of them no longer had to squeeze in front of the vanity each morning to get ready, they didn’t have to worry about not having enough time to wash their dirty dishes from breakfast before going to work, nor did they have to rush home from work to cook dinner. After retirement, mother would wake up an hour before her daughter so she had time to do her hair, cook breakfast, and buy groceries for lunch and dinner. After her daughter would leave for work, mother would tidy up the apartment and even had time to go for a stroll in the park and get some sun. After lunch she would take a nap to make up for that hour of sleep she lost waking up early. By the time her daughter got home, there was a hot meal already waiting for her on the table. In the park, mother met a few other retired women, one of which was a fan of Yue opera. One of the interesting things about that park was that it had a special corner devoted to Yue opera; every morning singers and musicians would gather to perform. There were also two women who would practice swordplay at the park; they very enthusiastically volunteered to give her lessons. Between listening to Yue opera and practicing swordplay, mother’s schedule at the park filled right up. Eventually, there was a widowed and retired teacher who developed a crush on her. He gave her a bouquet of roses on Mother’s Day. That day, as she entered the longtang neighborhood with those flowers in hand, the look on her face was a combination of embarrassment and joy – she looked like a teenage girl. That was also the reason she stopped going to the park. And before long a real estate developer took over more than half of the park; they demolished the original park wall and turned it into a green space in the middle of the street. She, on the other hand, found a new place to spend her time – the church. Following the urgings of one of her neighbors, mother turned to Christianity. She started attending church services every Sunday morning. At the same time, the Christian hymns helped her develop an affinity for singing. Naturally, mother had a much more open personality than her daughter; this wasn’t due to her richer life experience but simply because she had a more childlike disposition. Although daughter was naturally more closed off, thanks to her mother’s guidance, she too was able to start a new life. That is why the daughter was never worried about retirement.

Before long, it was her turn to retire. Just before her retirement, her work unit had arranged for her to participate in a trip to Zhangjiajie in the Hunan province, sponsored by the district trade union. This was a big deal for both mother and daughter. It may be hard to believe, but neither of them had ever set foot outside their city. Most think that peasants in the countryside are the only ones who never get out to see the world, but people in this city are equally cloistered, in fact, and it is even harder for them to leave because they lack the curiosity about the outside world that peasants have. They believe that living anywhere other than Shanghai is utterly unthinkable. However, times were changing and all kinds of new things began to emerge. One of those new things was traveling for leisure. Neither of them was very enthusiastic when it came to travel, but nor were they indifferent. If they had the opportunity to go see some new places and have a good time, why not take advantage of it? It’s not like they were setting out to earn a living. The television, magazines, and advertisements from various travel agencies all brought those faraway places much closer to them – they no longer felt so distant and terrifying. All of this began to invisibly transform these conservative urbanites’ view of the world.

Mother and daughter excitedly began preparations several days before her trip. Their first consideration was hygiene. Mother bought a bottle of alcohol cotton balls, disposable wet wipes, paper towels, and toilet paper, which she carefully packed into plastic bags. In order to prevent cross-contamination, she also prepared a bottle of Dettol antiseptic liquid. The second thing they prepared was food, which mainly consisted of crackers and instant noodles, which she could eat in case she didn’t like the local food. She was actually quite picky, and there were all kinds of things she didn’t eat: lamb, beef, chili, garlic, coriander, radish, pepper, and egg yolk. In case she did eat something that upset her stomach, they packed plenty of Berberine. In terms of clothing, they focused on packing outfits that would keep her warm. Although it was early autumn, they insisted on packing cotton pants, a wool sweater, and a raincoat. Figuring that she would likely do a lot of walking and mountain hiking, they bought her a pair of hiking shoes. Those shoes were a departure from their usual fashion, bringing an athletic energy and a sudden burst of modern sensibility to her elegant style. Finally, they couldn’t help but think about the colleagues she would be travelling with. Mother and daughter were both affable and valued their relationships with others highly. Now that she would be traveling with her colleagues, it would be especially important for her to look out for one another and maintain a close relationship with her fellow travelers. That led them to take a trip to the supermarket to buy a bunch of snacks she could share with everyone: prunes, Taiwanese plums, hawthorn slices, Want Want senbei crackers, and chocolate covered nuts. They divided the snacks up into small packets, which they stuffed into all the remaining nooks in her already packed suitcase – somehow they managed to squeeze it all in. With all these snacks and the rest, her luggage ended up extremely heavy. The day she boarded the train, they even recruited Uncle Yun to help carry her suitcases. By this time, Uncle Yun was already an old man with a large bald spot, but he was still strong enough to help with her luggage, carrying each large suitcase under each arm. Mother and daughter shuffled behind him, carrying just a bunch of small odds and ends. Once aboard the train, each of her suitcases took up an entire row on the luggage rack. The colleagues traveling with them were actually from different work units, so they didn’t know each other, but since they were traveling together and everyone was excited for the trip, they all helped each other out. No one uttered a word that could spoil the mood. This put mother at ease and she motioned for her daughter to pass around some of the snacks they had prepared. That meant that they had to take down the large suitcase they had just put up on the rack, open it up, and search for those packages of snacks tucked away inside. By then, the train was about to depart and the conductor was already instructing those without tickets to leave the train. They were still passing the snacks around when the train began to gradually pull away from the station, interrupting the emotional moment when mother and daughter were about to say goodbye. But in a way, the hasty departure helped them avoid making it into an awkward public scene.

The sanitary conditions on the train were actually much better than what she had imagined. She was lucky in that the passenger car seemed new, with a fresh carpet, new bedding and curtains. Even the conductor’s uniform seemed to be a new design. Sitting together in that bright, clean carriage, she quickly got to know everyone sitting with her. Going out of town allowed her to leave all those random daily tasks aside; she felt particularly relaxed and her speech grew excitable, punctuated by frequent bursts of laughter. There were about a dozen people in her tour group, six of whom were women, and they all slept together in the same sleeper compartment on the train. Once they arrived, some of the hotel rooms had three beds while others had two, so the women divided themselves up into groups based on the size of the rooms. She partnered up with Xiao Hong, who worked for the trade union and helped organized the trip. Xiao Hong was in her late twenties and had a child that had just learned to walk. She seemed to have left a favorable impression on Xiao Hong, who suggested they share a room. Their room had three beds, so they added a girl named Xiuping, who was a model worker in their district and director of some neighborhood committee. Although she was only forty, she looked much older than her. Among their group, there were two others she became close with; she spent a lot of time with them all on the trip and just being with them made her feel more at ease. For their first meal together on the train, everyone sat together with the food they’d brought. With sausage, eggs stewed in tea, roasted chicken, cake, hamburgers, instant noodles, and all kinds of fruits, nuts, and drinks, it was quite the sumptuous feast. For their second meal, they divided up into small groups – the men either went to the meal car or stayed behind to wait for the vendor that sold box lunches. The women on the other hand just finished up their leftovers from the previous meal. Xiao Hong didn’t eat anything, instead choosing to crawl into her bunk and take a nap – everyone said she must be missing her son. Once the lights came on and the world outside the window grew dark, the train carriage seemed warmer. Only on the rarest of occasions had she ever spent the night away from home; she felt like she had been transported to different world. Sitting on the bunk and gazing out at the broad expanse of darkness outside the window, she would occasionally catch sight of a flurry of lights shooting past. As they approached their first stop, the lights flashed by more frequently, there was something almost resplendent about them. When the train pulled into the station, crowds of people on the platform rushed towards the door urgently. A vendor on the platform pushed a cart alongside the train windows to sell snacks to the passengers already aboard; in contrast to the chaos of the people trying to board, the vendor appeared completely at ease. Even though she looked about the same age as Xiao Hong, she was actually the only one among the group nearing retirement age, so they let her have the bottom bunk. She didn’t sleep very well that night. Every time they pulled into another station she would wake up and turn to look out the window. Although it was the middle of the night, the station lights were all brightly lit and the platform was filled with people busting around and getting on and off the train. Oh, what a lively night it was! As she slipped in and out of sleep, she gradually got further and further away from Shanghai, beginning her life of travel.

She turned out to be more adaptable than she had imagined. The weather in Hunan was extremely humid – she would hand wash her clothes but after two days they still weren’t dry and then she’d have to move on to the next hotel. She constantly felt hot and sticky. There were a few times she thought she was on the verge of getting sick, but somehow managed to avoid it. In the end, it was Xiao Hong that had the hardest time adapting; she broke out in a rash and developed an upset stomach – she was the one who ended up having to take care of Xiao Hong. Most of the food in Hunan used a lot of hot peppers. When they ate hot pot there were a few bright red peppers floating in the broth; she didn’t realize how spicy they were until it was too late. Later she learned to fish those red peppers out of the broth as soon as they brought the pot to the table; but it was always hard to get them all out. Over the course of the subsequent days, she surprisingly discovered that she could actually handle spicy food and found it especially good with rice. On one occasion she ate a piece of meat that she couldn’t identify; only after trying it did the restaurant owner tell her it was turtle meat. Although it was a bit strange for her to eat something like that, there wasn’t much she could do since she had already eaten it. The next time turtle meat was on the menu she just went ahead and ate it; she had, after all, already crossed that bridge. She also found that she was quite the walker, being light and nimble meant that she could hike for long distances without getting tired. But she never did wear those hiking shoes she brought; they just didn’t look right on her. Instead, she just wore her usual pair of light brown leather shoes with short heels, which felt perfectly comfortable. They even took a bamboo raft out on the Mengdong River. Several of the women held hands and gripped one another tightly as their raft tossed up and down against the waves. They exhausted themselves with laughter. The scenery was so gorgeous it looked like a painting and she felt like she was now a part of that painting.

Her favorite thing was the tourist products sold at each scenic location they visited. Those items were actually all quite similar, yet she nevertheless loved going from one vendor to the next, carefully looking at all the products and haggling over prices. The trinkets sold were all low-quality and poorly designed, yet she found them to be a source of endless fascination. She had actually seen so very little of the world that her perspective on things was likely no different from that of a girl who’d grown up on a farm. It wasn’t long before the trinkets she bought took up all the space in her luggage that had once been occupied by those snacks and instant noodles. Whenever the vendors were women, they would ask her all kinds of questions, like where was she from, what kind of work she did, how many children she had, and how old she was. At first she would answer truthfully, telling them that she wasn’t married but gradually came to think twice about that, instead simply saying: They’re in Shanghai! For the vendors that were particularly chatty and insisted on knowing how many kids she had, their ages, and whether they were boys or girls, she would just smile and walk away. Later she took a feistier approach, spewing lies and teasing them. Sometimes she’d tell them she had a little boy, other times she would say she had a little girl; sometimes she said she only had one child, other times she would say she had two; as for their ages, sometimes she would say they were in kindergarten, other times she would say they were in college. Hearing that, some of the vendors would get suspicious and ask just how old she was. She would tell them the truth but none of them believed her. If they asked again, she would simply repeat her answer. Gradually she came to take pleasure in these exchanges, sometimes even kicking off the conversation. For instance, when she saw a child she would ask the mother: How old is he? Where do you plan on sending him to school? Then the mother would naturally start asking her similar questions. There was only one occasion in which a woman she was chatting with pointed to the male members of her group and asked: Which one of them is your husband? The question left her so embarrassed she simply scurried away.

From the Mengdong River, the group arrived at a place called Wang Village. It was a remote village that became famous after it was used as the shooting location for a film. The village capitalized on the film by naming all of its restaurants and sites after people, places, scenes, and plotlines from the film. They also performed all kinds of local songs, dances, dragon boat races, rain ceremonies, and other traditional rituals. Wang Village was located alongside the Mengdong River and in the distance were a series of dark green mountains surrounded by pristine blue water and a forest of jade green trees. The town that developed alongside this waterway must have been a prosperous hub. The local houses in the town are adorned with blue-gray bricks, black tile roofs, and high retaining walls. There is something truly enchanting, almost seductive, about the area which was once the cradle of Chu civilization. There was a woman standing in a doorway holding a little girl that couldn’t have been more than a year old. The little girl was wearing a small hat that resembled the mythical qilin; she had bright red lips, dark black eyes, and suddenly cast them a strange glance. It was the kind of look that clearly only an adult woman would be capable of making – the corners of her eyes shot up, her cheeks displayed what appeared to be a smile, and a mysterious look crossed her face – the whole thing was extremely strange. She couldn’t help but be shocked by the girl’s expression.

Playing out on stage of a pop-up theater in front of the bluestone street was a traditional tale about love and marriage. The performers didn’t look like professional singers or dancers. Their movements were uncoordinated and their singing and acting seemed to lack any formal training. Their expressions also appeared somewhat restrained; they couldn’t compare to the vitality expressed by the local mountain people walking in the streets; yet there was something quite beautiful about their appearances and the way they sang. The girls on stage all had a pure beauty and a unique twinkle in their eyes. Hidden beneath the surface of their awkwardness was the romantic yearning of a budding love – they must have all been little demons when they were young, like the girl she’d seen in the doorway. Of the two lovers the story was about, the boy was more petite than the girl and extremely thin. He was less striking than the girl, but he had an intense look in his eyes. When he locked eyes with the girl it was as if he were silently conveying thousands of thoughts to her. Although she couldn’t understand the lyrics they were singing, their voices had a purity about them, and though the drums and melody were a bit out of tune, their rhythm and overall spirit were perfectly in sync. Once they’d finished their song, the boy and girl exchanged bouquets of hydrangeas and held hands. Next on stage was a clownish grandmother character played by a young man – she was the matchmaker. Together they drank and sang in a scene that was clearly a wedding banquet. As their singing continued, it grew in intensity. Finally, out of nowhere, a palanquin appeared, carried down from the stage and into the crowd of tourists. A woman announced in Mandarin Chinese: ‘Someone is trying to kidnap the bride!’

Once the sedan chair arrives at the crowded street, the performance reached its climax. The onlookers grew chaotic as they made way for the sedan chair to pass. Leading the procession were four girls dressed in pink. The sedan was covered with a banner of shining red silk and carried by four young men dressed in green who danced through the crowds. Next came the sound of horns and flutes, announcing the festive atmosphere. Auspicious clouds suddenly appeared in the sky above, hovering above the peaks of the green mountains. Several boats came to the shore, bringing with them even more tourists. A smile appeared on the actresses’ faces, but they were much more natural than when they were on stage. This was clearly their favorite part of the performance, it had a mischievous spirit about it. The actresses scanned the crowd, searching for someone in the audience who could play the role of the bride. They looked up and down through the bustling crowd as they walked half the length of the street. All the girls in the crowd laughed and screamed as they moved out of their way. They were all terrified of being pulled into the sedan chair, but in fact, they all secretly hoped to be chosen. The performers smiled but didn’t stop, until they reached her. The four girls suddenly exchanged glances and came to a halt; this signalled to the four boys behind them to lower the sedan chair and wait. That is when four pairs of hands suddenly reached out to grab, snatching her up before she even had the chance to scream. Seemingly out of thin air, they conjured up a red wedding robe, which they slipped over her before pushing her into the sedan chair, raising it off the ground, and shuttling her away. This time, the young men carrying the sedan chair break into a light jog as they crossed the street. The horns blaring behind them became more furious. Everyone in the street was clapping and cheering, especially her colleagues, whose palms grew red from clapping. Deep down, they are all rather surprised – after all, she isn’t the youngest or prettiest, how did those actors so quickly figure out that she is a single and unmarried woman?

Those young men and women surrounded the sedan chair as they trotted in a circle around the bluestone streets. Only when they finally returned to the spot where they picked her up did they stop to let her out of the palanquin. Wearing that crimson silk robe, she was smiling, her face bright red. Xiao Hong and Xiuping helped her down from the chair and out of that wedding robe, tossing it back to the palanquin bearers. She laughed so hard that her body grew limp and she couldn’t speak, but her heart was racing. The sound of the drums and horns gradually faded into the distance before eventually falling silent. The crowd began to disperse and the mood of jubilation died down. But she was still laughing, as were her colleagues, who surrounded her. In that moment, she was like a celebrity, and not knowing how to act, all she could do was laugh. The sound of her laughter echoed along the bluestone streets. Had this village been devoid of all these tourists and performances, it would have been an extremely peaceful place. They could hear the sound of their footsteps, which rang out against the bluestone streets. After laughing for so long, she began to feel tired. Her laughter suddenly ceased and she felt tears in her eyes."

    "text": "They started out as fraternities, the cults. Poorer students wanted strong networks, like the ones boarding school pupils had already. At the start, in the 50s and 60s, they were just normal societies. Like many things, they took a brazy turn in the 70s. Splits in the main fraternities led to infighting, then military rulers saw a chance to use them to break up student protests, pumped them with money and cutlasses and guns and set them at the unions. Fraternities began to intimidate professors for grades, prostitute female students, carry machetes and practice idol worship of unseen Gods.

We could ask why the religious, metaphysical element is there but it’s there in a lot of places – it’s there in Parliament, it’s there in the White House. The more pressing question is: why do positive things turn negative in one context, but not in another? In Nigeria it’s like everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. We can’t catch a break and from what I’ve seen online it causes Nigerians a lot of anxiety because they worry there’s something uniquely wrong with them – I mean us – as a people, to have a government like this, a police force like this, a power grid like this and so on. Looking at it from the UK and knowing the people here this explanation seems ridiculous, but it’s hard to argue with the weight of history. I mean, say what you want about phi-bettta-gamma or whatever, but there’s no massacres section on their Wikipedia. I spend a lot of time digesting this stuff. I wrote a whole article and still I didn’t feel like I’d got it all out.

I told my dad about the piece on the motorway, one hour after my tenancy ended. My landlord had put the rent up, and now my boxes blocked the rearview mirror. Other cars glid past like snooker balls.

Article ke? Dad said, looking in the back mirror.

The one for VICE. That’s the first one I’ve got in there.

Are they big?

Yeah they’re big Dad, I said, smiling.

His face softened.

And they paid you for this?

Yes.

VICE, he muttered to himself. That means sin doesn’t it? Is that a good thing to call a magazine?

My mum flashed a smile: what’s the article about?

Cults in Nigeria.

My dad groaned.

Don’t you think people want to read something positive?

I write a lot of positive things.

Eh, about Europe, and America. It’s only Nigeria’s dirty laundry that you want to put out in the open. That’s where they write about Nigeria isn’t it? On Sin dot com.

I went out to see a few of my friends from school, the ones who were still in the area. I caught myself looking at them and thinking: Shit, you’re old. I couldn’t shake the feeling we were only kids in adult make-up with fake beards, clothes too big for us, bodies too big for our heads. I saw my friend Ama. At school she’d been one of those people you never saw on their own.

We were at a pub in Purley, a little Brexit but the drinks were cheap – wooden walls and stained red and gold carpets, and a contingent of sixty-year-olds who never seemed to leave. It was the same pub Ama’s dad had caught her at back when we were younger. We must’ve been sixteen or something and he dragged her out by her hair and it was a big deal on Snapchat, one of those vids that got screen recorded so many times the captions stacked on top of each other until you could barely see what was going on. I brought the story up again to liven up the conversation and she did one of those fake smiles you do to crazy people. Ama is someone whose face is the mirror of her emotions, she can’t help it. She must have grown up in a very different family to me to get away with being so open. Or maybe a similar family, but one she dealt with differently. I dropped it regardless – I didn’t want her to be mad at me and if we started talking embarrassing stories from them times I’d be in trouble anyway. I ordered her another drink. We ran into a few people from school who wanted to know what I was doing, but it was never what they expected it to be.

I got back and my parents were watching MasterChef in the dark. Somebody’s main course had fallen apart. The lamb was overcooked, the fondant potatoes – something that had never looked appetising to me at all and that I take as proof that people will eat anything if you say it in French – were hard, the jus hadn’t reduced. The contestant brought the food to the judges with shame deep in her eyes.

I don’t think I’ve shown you what I’m really capable of, she said.

No, you haven’t, my dad said, you’re going home!

He chuckled.

My mum was shouting to my dad – not at him – in a mix of Yoruba and English. She took the last can out of her shopping bag and slammed it down on the counter then drew her finger across the top of the tin as though marking a pie chart, dividing it in half and then half again. My dad was ambivalent. His body too, was split down the middle – one hand in his pocket signalling calm, the other with one single finger pointing, signalling husbandly outrage on his wife’s behalf. Something to do with hitting something else. Oko, the word for car. Something that happened a long time ago, something to do with never forgetting. I heard the word for car again and cut in asking if the Volkswagen was ok.

I said oko, she said, not ọkọ̀.

Someone hit your farm?

Your dad’s father had a farm back in your dad’s town.

There are some legal issues, my dad said.

People with issues in their head, she said.

Oh, I said.

In your father’s family.

I glanced at my dad. That sounds tough, I said.

They have a more forthright approach to dealing with issues, he said.

Forthright. I tried to understand: How do you mean?

They’re not as Western, he said. They value different things.

Mum laughed, almost a snort. She mimed washing her hands and shook them in front of her.

God help me, she said. My husband works for the United Nations.

My mum picked the blue reusable shopping bag off the countertop, folded it loudly and stuffed it into the drawer under the sink. I looked at my dad, who now had both hands in his pockets. He said something in Yoruba, more calmly. My mum replied and they nodded conspiratorially. The discussion had closed. My dad pointed at me with his lips, then the hallway, then me, then the hallway again.

Before you write another article, he said. On WICKEDNESS.

Mum bumped into me getting out the shower at three in the afternoon as she was coming back from her prayer group and raised her eyebrows. I waved at her. I went downstairs to eat and found my dad waiting for me in the kitchen. I sat down with my cereal and he stood over me with his hands clasped behind his back. He cleared his throat.

We’re going to work on a little project today, he said, in the garden.

Any discussion of my dad must include the garden. It’s a monument to the strength of an African man’s will; unbending, unyielding water crashing endlessly on life’s shores, and less a location itself than a collection of textures and intersecting planes, grass slopes, shallow brick walls, pink and green and lavender and yellow, with green and purple hedges on either side. Recently something had been eating at the rose bushes. My dad didn’t know what, and he was determined to compensate for the damage in other areas until the threat could be apprehended.

We went to work repotting the hydrangea bushes. I squatted down to hold their ceramic pots steady, while my dad hacked at the soil to get them free and then held the whole bush aloft with one arm, like a heretic’s head, leaving me to scramble for a new pot. He lowered the bush back into position and we alternated between pouring new soil and patting down what was there already into place. Two hours, thirty pots. Rinse and repeat.

That was Saturday.

On Sunday the project was raking the leaves. I went round after him kicking the leaves into tighter piles, then circling round to bag them up. I had a thought.

Do you have any gloves? I asked.

Gloves? He said.

For the leaves.

What, are they going to cut you?

You don’t have garden gloves?

Dad put one hand on my shoulder.

It’s good to feel the plants, he said.

I had one earbud in and I listened to a podcast on the Iraq War as analysed through Simpsons episodes. They went over this Treehouse of Horror episode where Kang and Kodos invade Springfield and blame it on their weapons of mass disintegration. You see Tony Blair and these suits now on daytime TV and life insurance ads but twenty years ago he was lying so Britain could burn people alive. Listening to all this stuff made me feel that people have very short memories when it comes to the things they’re ashamed of.

I picked a thorn out my thumb and sucked the blood out the wound. Rusty, slightly sweet. Just then Dad’s rake hit on a snag at the very back of the garden, close to the fence. He called me over to look, scraped the top layer of leaves off and saw something that made him put the rake down. The flesh was grey and wet but the ribcage was clearly visible, about the size of a small dog. I couldn’t make out where the head was supposed to be.

Oh my God, I said.

Dad squatted over the body. He took his hood down, exposing his bald head to the rain. So you were the bastard that attacked my rose bushes, he said. I told God to punish you, and my God is a mighty God because you have been struck down. You didn’t know it was my roses you were eating. But you know now.

A few days after that I met back up with Rika. We had met on the apps, although we had crossed paths a few years before at a young journalist conference in Hamburg. She was much more attractive, in person, than I remembered her being. She had big eyes and short black hair, a kind of sickly, striking, look to her cheeks. She talked to me about the things her ex-boyfriend had done to her and the state of the publishing industry, and then she asked me what I wrote about for my last article.

It was about cults in Nigeria, I said.

I got voted most likely to join a cult in high school you know, she said.
I continued talking. The cults I was writing about weren’t religious, or at least they didn’t start that way. By the late 80s, early 90s, they were out of control, I said. Animal sacrifices at crossroads, mass shootings, all that stuff. I found this anti-cult poster from the 90s.

Rika took my phone. The screen read:

SECRET CULT IS DEATH. THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF NIGERIA WARNS THAT SECRET CULT IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR SOUL.

She pursed her lips.

Dangerous to your soul, she said. I like that. I wish the British government warned about dangers like that.

When it was time to part, I went for a hug but she offered a handshake instead. Fair enough, I thought. Leaving, I came through central Brixton and the crush of people outside the station towards Electric Avenue, selling incense, stepping around homeless people with cardboard signs and caps turned up in front of them. Many old people too but getting older myself I understood that old and young were different points in the same stream. I considered what my dad would’ve looked like passing through this same street ten or twenty years ago, how he would’ve dressed, how he would’ve walked, even. Rika texted while I was on the bus. She wanted me to go for dinner with her and her parents next week. The bus turned suddenly and I nearly fell over.

I got back late, maybe one in the morning. There was a red BMW parked in the driveway and lights on in the living room. Coming through the doorway I peered in: there my parents were, on the couch with a man who looked familiar but who I couldn’t quite place, moist skinned and with a belly like a sawed-off basketball stuffed under his jumper. He was talking about a restaurant to my dad, about a customer trying to leave without paying. The man on the couch described sneaking through the kitchen to confront the customer with a card reader and a wooden spoon. He saw me in the hallway and waved me into the living room.

Look at him, the man said, he doesn’t remember me.

Of course he remembers you, my dad said.

Where do you remember me from?

I said he’d been at my confirmation party. That was always a good guess. The man nodded patiently, then roared with laughter. Closer now I noticed that my mum had bags under her eyes, and as the man began a story about himself and a group of Chinese seafood suppliers going drinking at a pub in Hastings, she got up abruptly, saying she should go sleep.

No, stay here, stay with us! The man said. He shifted in his seat but his belly seemed always to stay in the same place.

I’m so tired.

We can sleep when we’re dead!

Nobody will die in Jesus’ name, she said. Bami, this is your Uncle Bolaji. Make sure you switch the light off when you come upstairs. Last night you forgot.

Uncle said he should be going as well. He gathered himself to his feet heavily and mentioned something about inviting the family to his restaurant. Chioma will be so happy to see you, he said.

When you come back in the day, Dad said, I’ll show you the garden properly.

Talk louder man, Uncle said, you’re slurring.

I’ll show you the garden.

Which garden?

My dad puffed his cheeks out and Bolaji slapped him on the back.

You know this man was the only man at university with a garden, he said. He fenced off a section of bush behind the Pharmacology labs, like it was Hyde Park.

 

–

 

My dad rolled fluffy balls of pounded yam greedily between his fingers and dipped them into rich red and green stew. He dabbed the fingertips of his right hand in the bowl of water and reached for his glass of Guinness, burping and covering his mouth with a napkin. Bolaji watched him happily as he ate, and then craned his head around and watched a server clear a table. Eagle-eyed, he slipped easily between total agitation and relaxation, not unlike a father watching his child on the swing sets.

They played the specifics of their shared history out for my benefit, my mum chipping in to clarify or affirm – best friends at university but separated by migration, re-united by migration as well when Uncle came to the UK looking for a job in a kitchen and slept on my dad’s couch until he found one. They were separated again when Bolaji went to Lagos to set up a restaurant there. Uncle tired of this line of conversation quickly, I sensed it made him feel old. He asked what I was doing with my time.

Gardening with my dad, I said, and trying to place pitches, after my last article.

What’s your last article about?

Cults in Nigeria. His eyes lit up; he collected himself. He took on a haughty look and folded his arms.

Cultism, he said, what do you know about cultism?

I know what I researched, I said.

That’s not knowledge. In the bush they say there are two kinds of knowledge – the kind that you know from what you have seen with your own eyes and your own ears, and everything else. Research is not real knowledge.

So I should join a cult?

No. But you should interview someone who did.

Uncle wrote a number on a napkin and handed it over. Next to the number he’d written his own name.

But the original cultist is right over there, he said, pointing. International Soul Cultist Extraordinaire.

Taking his napkin and turning it over in his hands my dad tore at the paper and placed the scraps in a pile on his plate. He nodded, only slightly, eyes lowered.

It wasn’t one of those terrible ones that they have these days, Uncle continued. It was a lot of fun when we were doing it. That’s not to say nobody got hurt. There was a bit of wahala. But these kids these days, they’re crazy. They’re shooting their professors.

I nodded. The things I was researching happened in my parents’ country, in their lifetimes. Why shouldn’t they be a part of them? Why not a cult, I thought to myself. People do all kinds of things when they’re young.

What was it called? I said.

We were the Norse. Everybody was a Pirate back in those days, but your dad – he pointed again, enthusiastically – he was a bit of a maverick.

He came up with the name?

Oh, he came up with everything. The name, the pledge, the colour scheme, the logo.

Wow.

Yes o. He was actually the leader, you know. The chief.

Bolaji that’s OK, Mum said.

He reached into his jacket pocket. Where’s the dis-ting. I have a picture somewhere. We used to call him Magnus.

Because of the Norse?

See? Uncle clicked his fingers, you got it. This kid has sense oh. You dey raise am well.

Magnus, I thought, a whole new name. An old name actually. I’d been calling him Dad, but he’d had a whole lifetime’s worth of people calling him Magnus, the Scandinavian name, in the cult that he founded and designed the logo for. By now he’d taken his own napkin apart totally and started on my mum’s. The pieces were all the same size, they were all the same square shape. He glanced back at me, a few times. I didn’t know how to read it. I thought for a second he was going to jump out his chair and drag me out the restaurant like a naughty child. It was only later I realised he was worried I was judging him. I had never seen embarrassment on his face before.

Rika was late and I was on time. Her parents trailed behind her, looking like college professors, which is what they were. They had their arms around each other and their coats were nearly identical shades of brown, something akin to old corrugated iron.

She and her parents talked mainly to each other, not cutting me out of the conversation but not leaving space for me either. Her father had the flu, it was going around. Rika’s mother had had a hip replacement a few months before. By the time dessert came they were in an argument about whose side of the family was weirder, the mum’s or the poorer father’s. I sat back and observed, I sat back and thought. There’s self-obsessed, but what’s the word for when a group of people are obsessed with each other? Maybe they don’t have one, I thought, or at least one that isn’t to do with nationalism and ethnic cleansing.

I checked for the best route home and saw there was a train strike on and the bus would take an hour and a half. There was no way my parents would still be awake. I didn’t want to stand in the street for too long so I started walking to the bus stop, down a quiet suburban street. How many families on this road alone, I thought, a driveway and a front garden and one point five children, fifteen years of selective silence, places in the parents’ minds the kids can’t go. A waiting room, one person standing and another sedated lying down, some callipers, some screaming, a twelve to sixteen hour wait then a baby’s born, then a mother, then a father, all one after the other in that order. There was a gust of wind; I pulled my coat collar up. A red Mercedes pulled up alongside me and the window rolled down. The driver shouted blackie! out the window and sped off. I put my headphones in and checked my phone again for buses. A few minutes later I saw headlights in front of me and turned to see a red car driving up again and I quickened my pace, but the car was a BMW not a Mercedes. The window rolled down. Uncle Bolaji looked at me, appalled.

Walking at this hour? You don’t have a car?

He pulled over and waited for me to get in. The car smelled of mothballs and cologne.

Seeing a lady friend? He said.

I considered if I had been.

You know what, he said, I don’t want to know.

He typed a postcode into the sat-nav; it was my post code. The sat-nav was an overlarge screen surrounded by silver metal rails which curved like the lane we were turning off now and onto a two-lane road towards a roundabout.

What’s her name? he said.

Rika.

Just Rika?

I don’t know her surname yet, you know.

Ah. That’s not good. You don’t know her surname, and you’re sleeping with her?

I’m not sleeping with her.

Of course not, he said. Don’t tell me.

We came closer to the roundabout. Bolaji had brought a smell with him into the car, it came over the air-con, slightly bitter, malty. One hand came off the steering wheel and gripped my shoulder. I felt we were going to clip the parked cars to our left.

You shouldn’t let the dark meet you outside, especially not with women, he said. It doesn’t end well. No, listen. I know what you’re thinking. I’m being a hypocrite. But it’s because I’m a hypocrite that I’m saying something worth listening to.

What were you up to?

Me myself I wasn’t out tonight actually, he said. I was at home having a few beers and I wanted to go for a drive.

Oh ok.

I looked out the window.

A few beers?

Maybe three or four.

How’s Chioma? I said. You said she was feeling ill before?

She’s better now. You know when you have a wife and they get ill you can’t be out gallivanting the way you are now. I remember your dad at uni, he missed a whole week because your mother had a cold.

I reached and turned the radio down.

I thought my parents met in London, I said.

Yes, he said. Yes, London.

But you’re saying they knew each other in Nigeria.

Yes. Yes, Nigeria too. But not very well, he said.

They were going out with each other, in Nigeria.

Yes.

But they didn’t know each other well?

No, they knew each other. But not as well as they were going to. That was the first time, he said, they met in Nigeria the first time.

Why did they stop talking, I said, my parents. What happened?

You should ask them, he said. They’ll tell you.

I looked over at him.

Alright, he said, alright. So they started at university. But your grandad, he had a farm. Farming makes people strict. And he was Christian as well, not like the Christians they have here, these ones that they don’t go to church. Christian with a capital C. When he found out your dad was seeing someone, he locked him in the basement for a week. Word got out. When the Norse found out we went down and beat hell out of that your grandad. We thought Magnus would be thankful, but he was mortified. The whole campus was talking about him. He stopped speaking to your mother.

There was that name again, Magnus. And a basement for a week. I thought of a little window up near the ceiling, some metal bars. A crowd of people with mutton chops and those cardboard cut-out afros they had in the eighties, stomping on my grandad’s head.

You happy now? He said.

I don’t know, I said. I’m still thinking about it.

It’s not that much to think about.

A cult beating up my grandad?

He laughed, a roar. You don’t know Nigeria, he said. You don’t even know England. That kind of thing happens every day.

I shrugged.

I think it’s good I told you. It’s good for bonding. So what if your mother disowns me. You should come over for dinner sometime. Chioma would be happy to see you again, she loves kids.

I’m not a kid.

Sure you’re not, Uncle said. You know we had a boy like you, but he didn’t make it out the hospital.

He flicked the indicator and craned his head around a bend in the road.

I told you the one about knowledge, he said, I’ll tell you another one. In Nigeria, they say it’s better to never have children than to have one child and lose it. That’s the worst. We say if a man with one child loses it, he’s lost his life.

I folded my hands in my lap.

I didn’t know about that.

How would you, you just met me a month ago.

He clapped me on the shoulder again.

Sorry about this jinky-janka driving oh, normally when I’m drunk I just – he made a gliding motion with his hand. I must be getting old.

The streetlights bathed him in waves of amber light through the window. I saw his whole face relax like somebody sleeping, just for a moment, then it snapped back like a rubber band.

A week later the foxes came again. My dad noticed when he was having his morning black breakfast tea; he dropped his mug and it shattered. I found him in the kitchen with my mother’s hands on his shoulders. Bolaji was visiting Nigeria for work, and Dad’s centre of gravity had shifted back to her.

I think the garden centre is middle class heaven, but in a pagan sense. The Greeks thought you’d wander forever in foggy fields, not knowing your own name, and this has come to pass in our world: all around me, pensioners changed direction in the middle of the aisle, looked left and right and left again, down at their paper maps and out in front of them in vast open spacing, calling out to one another with hoarse voices.

We’d gone to replace them but we couldn’t find the same kind of roses. Light pooled thick and hot under the greenhouse ceilings and I felt like an ant under a magnifying glass. I considered my dad, small and exhausted, walking through long aisles under the glass and dirty white plastic. His arms were tucked tight to his sides and his face was worn out, and I found myself feeling protective. All he wanted was his family and his garden. Why had I never seen him this way before?

What do you think? He asked.

I don’t know.

He made a face.

Maybe the dog roses.

That could work.

Bush in trolley he went to find a garden centre worker. He looked around and mumbled something.

Excuse me? The woman said. I’m sorry, I can’t hear you.

Do you have anything to deal with foxes? He said.

Deal with them?

She showed us to a section with electric boxes that emitted an ultrasonic noise when the animals came close. I picked up the slim white box and handed it to him.

And it hurts the foxes? Dad said.

The lady crossed her arms. It’s very uncomfortable for them yes.

I know they must have traps for foxes, Dad said later, when we were in the car. Maybe you can look on the internet and see if there’s one we can build. We can try this ultrasonic thing first but I think we’ll need something more vigorous.

I’ll do that, I said, another project.

By the time we got back I was tired. Dad went straight to the garage to put on his wellies. I went upstairs to wash my hands and he waved at me from the garden, looking much happier. When I went back down he was on the phone. He saw me and pressed the phone to his cheek, scratching his bald head.

Your Uncle’s dead, he said. A car crash. Someone hit him while he was parked.

 

–

 

My dad baked a Victoria sponge to take with us. Both my grandparents were dead but I had never really known them, them living in Nigeria, and I could only remember meeting them a few times. I had seen Uncle not long ago and I could see his face still in my mind very clearly. It made me weak to think there was no longer a real counterpart to my memories of him, that his face was the face of a corpse now.

Other relatives were in Uncle’s kitchen, they were in the hallway and the living room, compiling paperwork, cooking food, on the phone to work outside, but even with all the people there was a white peace in the house like a church at night, after the service is over and the wine and the host has been packed away and all that’s left is the smell of incense and the light through the stained glass windows. Chioma was on the couch trying to watch television. Dad put his arm around her. For a second she didn’t realise he was there.

I’m so sorry, he said.

How was the drive over, she said. Was it fine?

Dad shrugged. Chioma nodded. She looked up suddenly, as though hearing something upstairs.

Did you hear?

Yes. Yes Chioma.

No, she shook her head. Did you hear?

No.

I got the phone call this morning. Bolaji had a family in Lagos. A wife and three kids. She changed the channel. I always said, you know, if he wanted kids we could adopt one. After what happened. And then, when we had money, I said we should do IVF.

My dad put the cake down on the coffee table.

Can you believe it? Chioma went on. Thirty-four years of marriage. His oldest child is twenty. Twenty years old.

Jesus. Twenty years.

My mother and I looked at each other and back at Chioma on the couch. She looked out of her body with grief.

What a husband I had.

She changed the channel.

Bami! She called, there’s food in the kitchen.

I nodded at her but didn’t move. The flow of tears subsided. She looked directly at my dad’s face.

Did you know? She said.

Know what?

What do you mean what, she said calmly. What else?

I don’t know what you’re talking about.

What else would I be talking about?

He wiped his hand on his trouser, shifted in his seat. He raised his eyebrows, inviting her to continue speaking, to clarify again.

Oh okay, she said. I understand. You think I’m an idiot. You think you can come here and lie to my face. You and Bolaji were probably laughing about it for years. Just keep it going, another year, let’s see how far we can push our luck with this mumu. You feel bad now, abi? Okay. You will never feel good again.

My dad was rubbing his brow. He was looking across Chioma, into thin air. Her neck tensed, a smile on her face.

That’s fine, she said. But if you think I believe that nonsense look on your face you must be an idiot.

There was silence, the others in the house had stopped speaking. I kept wondering why he wasn’t moving. He mumbled something, getting to his feet, Chioma said in an even voice that things would not be well with him and that he would not live to see the fruit of his labours. She threw the TV remote and went on cursing, louder now, as the three of us went for the door. She threw the Victoria sponge at us and it landed in the vestibule and the plate shattered and sprayed shards on our legs. We got into the car and drove home.

    "text": "From the threshold of the living room Diana observed the blonde who was presiding over the party. The room was held in a hush, and the woman on the couch twisted her hands as she spoke, until a laugh broke out and she touched her fingers to her hair.

Diana shouldered her way into the living room as the laughter quieted. The blonde was seated in the center of a large sofa, cradling a half-empty tumbler and touching thighs with a bearded man who had begun speaking to her about something apparently urgent.

‘Who is that?’ Diana said to the woman beside her.

She gestured toward the blonde with her beer bottle. ‘That’s Lucy,’ she said.

Lucy wore a white tank top in which her breasts stood at attention, like loyal little pets, and she had the cheekbones and eyelashes that Diana associated with rarified, glossy womanhood.

The woman standing beside Diana introduced herself while on the sofa the blonde, Lucy, toyed absently with her necklace. Diana moved toward Lucy and softly touched the edge of the sofa.

‘Excuse me,’ Diana said to Lucy. She and the bearded man beside her both turned expectantly. ‘Could I get you another drink?’

A mild, appropriate blush washed across Lucy’s face. She was clearly used to being sought. ‘Sure. You know,’ she said to Diana, ‘I could use another drink, I’ll come with you. Okay?’ she said to the man, and rested her hand on his forearm for a moment, like a teacher reassuring a young boy that he will be just fine on his own.

Diana smiled, as much at this gesture as at Lucy’s acquiescence. As she led Lucy to the kitchen, her silver ring and the links of her watch gleaming against Lucy’s white top, she turned to see a crestfallen look in the eyes of the man on the sofa – a look that made her laugh out loud.

‘What?’ Lucy said.

‘Your friend,’ Diana said. ‘I think he’s jealous. What are you having?’

‘A gin and tonic, please.’

Diana arranged the bottles and located a knife in a kitchen drawer. She began to slice a lime. ‘I haven’t seen you here before,’ she said, indicating the apartment. ‘How do you know Minta?’

‘We went to high school together,’ Lucy said. ‘I only moved here recently, we haven’t seen each other in years. It was sweet of her to invite me.’

‘I think it was more a favor to us than to you,’ Diana said.

Lucy turned around on her heels, smiled, splayed her hands on the kitchen counter and leaned forward as though she were about to announce a dare. Diana saw that Lucy’s appeal was in the nostalgia of her looks: Hers was a teen beauty, at home nowhere more than in a miniskirt. Even in her bland slacks and loafers she had the flirtatious, dismissive charm of a girl at the height of her popularity, the challenge and invincibility of a team captain.

Diana poured the tonic into Lucy’s glass. When Diana was a teenager, no girl had ever given her the look Lucy gave her now. After an adolescence in which the very fact of her lesbianism had seemed to disqualify her from the contest of desire, she had, in her brief adulthood in the city, finally become attractive. She had natural qualities that hadn’t initially looked like advantages – height, broad shoulders and a face given to brooding – and she had learned to appropriate the mannerisms that made powerful men suspicious and irresistible, chief among them a degree of directness to which the world capitulated almost unconsciously. The spin, the smile, the crush of Lucy’s tits in the tank top: Diana recognized all this now with the wistfulness of a former adolescent boy who had once jacked off, in frustration, to a teen flick. In an hour she would make this bitch come around her fingers, and that’s how she would say goodbye to it once and for all – those excruciating sexless years – the slurs, the nights spent crying, the year she had starved herself and, perhaps worst of all, the relentless, disgusting, unconsummated wetness she had carried around between her legs, which marked her as an animal.

‘You know,’ Lucy said, taking a sip of her fresh drink, ‘I’m glad I came. I’m making friends already.’

Diana came around to Lucy’s side of the counter and placed her hand on the back of Lucy’s neck, where a light sweat had begun to collect. She could feel the thrum of intention beating in her own chest and along the muscles of her arms. There in the warm kitchen she let her ring rest against the first vertebra of Lucy’s spine and later, after the long charged walk to Diana’s apartment, when Lucy was supine on her bed, she felt with satisfaction the moment when the hard alien contour of the ring surprised Lucy, made her hitch her hips up before she could catch herself. Lucy smiled, to show she was game. From there Diana did what she had learned to do: make a girl feel absolutely surrounded, alternately by forcefulness and by utter softness, as though she were smothered in Diana’s desire. Diana could tell which kinds of girls would like this and which would find it overwhelming, and she intuited that Lucy’s capacity to receive passion had been so distorted by her excessive beauty that only a real showing would satisfy her. At the very end she crouched between Lucy’s legs and began to pet her softly, almost as though at any minute she would give it up. She kept at this for so long that Lucy began to shake, to say raggedly, no more, no more until, just a few moments later, she came with a humiliating trembling in her legs, her body splayed and limp like an empty bag.

‘Christ,’ Lucy said a while afterward, wiping her brow. A dank, sweet smell of success permeated the room.

‘You’ve never been fucked by a woman, have you?’ Diana said.

Lucy laughed – a lovely ripple, her breasts shaking – and then she turned, propped herself up on an elbow. ‘Did you really think that?’ she said. ‘Why do you think I came home with you?’

Diana made a neutral face. So who was that man Lucy had been sitting thigh-to-thigh beside, whose forearm she had touched so awfully – someone she teased for sport? The idea made Diana like Lucy better, maybe even grudgingly respect her. When Lucy left it was with shameless grace, the air of having won something flattering and inconsequential.

In the morning Diana made her way out for a coffee. She felt light and free. She was at home in the blare of traffic, roaming across blocks that smelled of bacon fat and sewage. The sun moved over her, confirming her strength. When she checked her phone, she saw that Minta had texted her. I heard you went home with Lucy! she wrote. Isn’t she special??

As Diana ascended the stairs back up to her apartment the word special echoed in her mind and conjured the disheveled hallway, the hush, the sight of Lucy glimpsed across the bay of heads, the spin of Lucy’s body as if she were suspended over a football pitch.

 

Lucy had been in the city three months. Sure, she said on the phone, she would let Diana show her around. Where did Diana like to go?

‘Well, now that the pools have opened, I like to go to the pools.’

‘You just want to see me in a swimsuit.’

Diana waited for her on Houston Street outside the entrance to Hamilton Fish. The early summer was yellow and jubilant. Lucy arrived wearing a competition one-piece under a denim skirt, carrying nothing but a water bottle and a small makeup kit tied around her wrist. Diana felt a keen satisfaction surveying Lucy’s proportions, the rightness of her shoulders, her waist, even the smart length of her hair.

‘You’ll have to share my towel, is that it?’ Diana said from behind her sunglasses.

The pool was filled with children celebrating their release from school, rowdy and irrepressible. Diana spread her single towel down at the far end and they sat together at the edge, their calves dangling in the water. The pool, protected and bejeweled, spread out before them in its vastness. The sound of traffic on Houston was distant yet comforting.

‘How do you know this place?’ Lucy said.

‘I know all the pools,’ Diana said.

‘Why don’t you go to the beach?’

Diana didn’t explain that she only felt safe in Manhattan, hugged between the rivers, aware at all times of what was up and what was down. She leaned into the reticence which had by now become natural to her, and which took on an air of glamour when paired with bravado. Lucy had no trouble keeping them both entertained. She had a keen memory for what were apparently years’ worth of stolen anecdotes, bar stories, family secrets. Her brother was a frequent protagonist: his troubles, his cruelty, the things he had stolen, the people her father had called to keep him out of prison.

In the second hour, while Lucy’s voice sped along over the contours of past summers, Diana noticed a pair of adolescent girls staring at them across a stretch of shallow water. The girls were long-haired, silky and full of themselves in pink bikinis which presumed more adulthood than belonged to them, and they alternated between whispers and shrieks. ‘But he just did it again the next month,’ Lucy was saying. ‘Can you believe that?’ Across the pool the bolder girl pointed at her, Diana, and gave a high laugh. Diana felt heavy. Her shoulders were too hulking even to remain upright. She hated the girls, their dark eyes and spoiled smiles, and simultaneously she felt grateful to them for their ruthless obedience to the truth. She made the smoothest possible entrance into the safety of the water, so that only her head was visible, and circled around in front of Lucy, shielding her eyes with her hand. Lucy talked charmingly. She hadn’t noticed anything.

As June meandered into July, Diana introduced Lucy to the Manhattan pools. On Saturdays they tried to visit two or three in a single afternoon. As they trekked on the subway from one set of locker rooms to the next, damp-haired and giddy with chlorine, Lucy outshone whatever else was on offer in the growing summer heat. The freckled tan on her chest had no rival. And the fifteen seconds of the weekend Diana cherished most were those in which she spread a triangle of sunscreen onto Lucy’s upper back: She felt the pressure of Lucy’s muscles straining toward her and the brute inside her shivered.

Lucy enjoyed those miserable cold showers at the pool, she laughed at the ads on the subway, she smiled at the idiot kids who raced around her street on scooters and nearly pushed her into traffic while she coolly produced her building key and shouted, like an overworked sister, ‘Don’t forget to drink some water!’ When Diana, ravenous by the time she got Lucy into bed at seven or eight in the evening, bruised Lucy’s hips without meaning to, Lucy liked this too.

Falling in love was the just reward for Diana’s years of stoicism, for all that grief that had not, in fact, been wasted, because it had yielded her this golden future. But doubts arose after Lucy fell asleep. Diana began to have thoughts that hadn’t troubled her in recent years, during which she had been so callous toward women that she had no need to be afraid of them. If it was the case that when she was a teenager she had been greedy, tactless, wounded, ugly – for she must have been all those, to have been so hated – it was inevitable that those qualities were still lying in wait beneath all her established charms, her boldness and her polished style, her significant silences, the shoulders which she had learned to hold just so. Since she had come to the city she had never disclosed to anyone this ghost that clung to her: the person she had been before. While Lucy slept in the cave of her arm, smelling of Coppertone and the lemon juice she combed into her hair, Diana looked around at the possessions which attested to the extremity of her solitude. The clock above her closet was not accurate, since no one consulted it; the costumes which were her city clothes hung flaccid and emptied of their authority. All these allures she pretended to, the allures that had ensnared Lucy, would soon be discarded as false tricks.

This doubt was a slender cup into which Lucy’s desire fell. Didn’t Lucy call Diana first thing on Saturday mornings and sometimes on weekday afternoons, too? Didn’t Lucy ask Diana about her favorite candies and which breeds of dog she admired when they passed gaggles on the sidewalk? Didn’t Lucy let her fingers linger on Diana’s waistband at the poolside? Diana’s mother, a timid woman who was unequal to what life demanded of her, had said only one meaningful thing about what Diana had endured: that adulthood would be more forgiving. Diana had not believed her, but she had prayed that her own skepticism would be contradicted. And perhaps Lucy was proof that her mother had a little wisdom.

While Lucy was on her arm, among her friends, Diana’s doubt struck her as insubstantial, like a memory left over from another world. Nothing fortified Diana so much as attending a party with Lucy. While lounging beside Lucy on that same sofa in Minta’s apartment, at a party later that summer, Diana felt the warm, lazy safety of a lizard in the sun. She was listening to Lucy and Minta talk about their hometown in Ohio. They had known each other in school, but they hadn’t been friends. ‘I always liked you,’ Minta said, ‘but you were just so popular. No one could get near you,’ and Lucy said, teasingly, ‘But you did get near me!’ and the two of them laughed.

‘The whole thing was just awful,’ Minta said. She looked tired and edging past her prime. Smoking had loosened her skin. In her voice high school seemed especially distant, a place far beyond the rivers. ‘Wasn’t it?’

‘Oh, it was high school,’ Lucy said. ‘It’s so bizarre. Nothing about it made sense. Right?’ And she began to describe the hierarchies and misplaced priorities and the intense, impossible passion she had felt inside herself then, all the time, the sense that she was filled with a manic energy which could only be temporarily relieved through athletics or teary conflict-resolutions. She described this with laughter and a little bashfulness, as though it were embarrassing, in retrospect, how important everything had seemed. Then Lucy said to Minta: ‘Do you remember Isabel?’

‘Isabel Walker?’

‘Isabel Garcia. Who came when we were sophomores?’

‘Barely.’

‘The thing I really remember about high school, to be honest, is how in love with her I was,’ Lucy said. ‘The first girl I was really in love with.’

‘Isabel Garcia?’ Minta said. ‘Really?’

By the time Isabel had moved to town, Lucy said, she had been worrying over her attraction to girls. But when she met Isabel it was undeniable. They got to talking during a biology class and met regularly in the evenings, at each other’s houses, for months. At school they didn’t acknowledge each other. God, it was harrowing to think of now, Lucy explained, since she had been so in love with Isabel, and yet at the time she felt she had no choice but to deny it.

Lucy and Isabel had agreed that their relationship would be an absolute secret: Neither of them was interested in being branded among their classmates. In order to facilitate their cover, they agreed that they were allowed to have boyfriends. Isabel was too busy to have a boyfriend; she spent her afternoons playing soccer on the JV team. But Lucy had a boyfriend already, the first in a series, and she really did feel warmly toward him. Their first explorations had been sweet – his inherent gentleness, her obliging fascination with his penis. But her interest in him was not comparable to her feelings for Isabel. Nights after she had spent a few hours with her boyfriend, she would sneak into Isabel’s house, just two blocks from her own, and spend hours writhing on a basement sofa with Isabel. Isabel was madly in love with Lucy, too. Once, Lucy recounted, she and Isabel had stolen some time together in the back of Isabel’s mother’s car in the afternoon, while her mother was inside speaking to an administrator, and Lucy had pulled on Isabel’s jersey in her hurry to dress before Isabel’s mother returned. Afterward when Lucy went to her boyfriend’s house her boyfriend said, What’s that you’ve got on? Lucy was beside herself with fear that he would realize it was Isabel’s jersey and find her out. But he quickly forgot.

By this point people on the couches around Lucy were listening. Her ability to captivate a room could not be attributed to her beauty alone; perhaps it was that fierce energy she recounted from her teenage years channeled into a new adult expression, animating her face and hands.

‘And what happened in the end?’ someone asked. ‘Between you and Isabel?’

It went on like this for a year, Lucy explained, and by then she had a different boyfriend. Isabel never got a boyfriend of her own. She was heartsick. She was starting to suspect that maybe it wasn’t all bullshit between Lucy and her boyfriend – that maybe there was something real in it. While Lucy was with her boyfriend Isabel would text her constantly, and when she failed to respond Isabel would grow by turns teary and livid. She would approach Lucy’s friends in the halls or the cafeteria and ask: Was Lucy all right? Had they heard from her? But her friends hadn’t known that Isabel and Lucy even knew each other, and this made Lucy terrifically anxious. What am I supposed to do? she said to Isabel. Even though we know it’s fake, he doesn’t! What else can I do?

One evening the boyfriend slept over at Lucy’s house. The two of them were woken in the darkness by Isabel standing over the bed. Lucy and Isabel knew all the back routes into each other’s houses, they knew how to find the hide-a-keys and the loose window sashes even in the dark. You sleep with him? Isabel shouted. With him? Isabel had watched them go to bed from the street, through the window. Lucy forced Isabel out of the house before her parents realized, but the boyfriend knew something strange had happened. In the dark he hadn’t recognized Isabel. But he had heard her. Who was that? he asked when Lucy returned to bed. Lucy, in her panic, could only say: My brother, it was just my brother, go back to sleep.

She and Isabel never spoke after that. Lucy’s boyfriend was confused and alarmed, however much she tried to placate him, and could not decipher the truth of what had happened. They broke up. Later, at a party, Lucy’s friends drunkenly accused her of sleeping with Isabel: What are you doing with that girl? they said. Don’t you know it’s obvious? It was the performance of her life, acting as though that rumor was so absurd it could only embarrass those who repeated it. When inwardly, of course, she was terrified of anyone discovering the truth.

Lucy paused and looked at Minta. ‘Did you know, did you hear about me and Isabel back then?’

Minta had heard rumors about Lucy, but there were rumors about girls all the time, she hadn’t believed it, she remembered merely being afraid of the day when the rumor would concern her, Minta. It was clear why Minta and Lucy had been afraid. After that week when she had asked around after Lucy, Isabel was teased and mocked relentlessly where before she had been ignored. Once she was surrounded by a group of boys and dragged down to the pool, where they threw her in the water along with the contents of her backpack.

But – it was strange, Lucy admitted, she had never understood it – if Isabel was targeted for her relationship with Lucy, Lucy herself, after that terrifying moment at the party, was never accused of having anything to do with Isabel again. And in fact, in the years afterward, she slept with other girls at school, very quietly, with none of the obsession or emotion she had felt for Isabel, and no one was the wiser.

‘How many?’ Minta said, with a look of admiration. ‘I mean, that time that we kissed, I thought that was a crazy thing, for both of us.’

‘Oh, I don’t know,’ Lucy said. ‘Ten? Fifteen? But I didn’t get over Isabel. It was all just kind of sad. But I felt like I had to do it. I was trying to feel free, or to like myself, or something. Even secretly.’

Lucy laughed and made a rueful face to show everyone listening that there was no reason to feel sorry for her. It was all so far in the past that it seemed silly to even think of it now.

The room grew loud again with the sounds of other people’s conversations. ‘I could use another drink, baby,’ Lucy said, her hand landing lightly on Diana’s thigh. Diana trembled. She rose and turned toward the kitchen, but Lucy pulled her back.

‘Wait,’ she said. Lucy’s lashes were long and delicate and evenly spaced, and she looked up at Diana from beneath them. ‘You don’t think I’m terrible for all that stuff, do you? What happened in high school? Because, you know, I’ve never treated anyone like that since – I would never treat anyone that way now, the way I treated Isabel. You know that, right?’

‘Of course,’ Diana said. She went to Minta’s kitchen, found the lime, cleaned the knife.

When she had made her excuses to Lucy she hurried home and by some instinct double-locked the door behind her. She was up all night considering it. Lucy was a type she had never imagined before: a girl who, by virtue of charm and a willingness to give blowjobs, managed not only to remain popular and beloved in her adolescence but, throughout that time, to conduct secret liaisons with the other closeted ice cream scoopers and lifeguards of her hometown, sneaking around in cars and public bathrooms and finished basements in an ecstasy from which she emerged only to repeat, at the next house party, the slurs to which she herself was never subjected. And not only this, but Lucy had graduated from this small-town regime of covert and ecstatic hedonism into life in the city, where she was praised for her lesbianism and instantly forgiven the mistakes of her youth. How many girls like this had existed in Diana’s own hometown? How many had there been in any town Diana had driven through, in the towns where she had gone to play soccer? Had they only been the most beautiful girls, the most popular girls? But they couldn’t have been, because there had been the kinds of girls Lucy had fooled around with, too, the girls like Isabel and Minta who she wouldn’t acknowledge at school. And for Diana there had been nothing – only the apparent senselessness of coming out at fifteen, which she had thought noble, and the loneliness she had believed would never leave her. She felt, at the time, that there was no choice about coming out. Everything had seemed so incontrovertible; it had not occurred to her to conceal her impulses, nor did she think she could have. She was too self-righteous to entertain conflicted feelings. And even though she hadn’t intended to come out, hadn’t Isabel been just like Diana – principled, unflinching in her sexuality, unable to stomach even the charade of a boyfriend, tortured by her classmates for these very qualities?

It wasn’t Lucy who had called Isabel names and thrown her into the pool. But wasn’t she responsible? Wasn’t it true that both Isabel and Diana had suffered at the hands of girls like Lucy, perhaps even more so than at the hands of their straight classmates, because it was girls like Lucy who might have helped them, if they had had the strength or the selflessness? No one could have hated Lucy, even if she had come out. The lives of girls like Diana would have been infinitely easier, if only one girl that everyone envied had stood up and said, It’s me you’re talking about.

Early in the morning Diana let herself out onto her stoop, lit a cigarette, and called Minta. On the third try Minta answered. ‘It’s six o’clock, Di,’ she said. ‘Is there an emergency?’

‘Listen,’ Diana said. ‘Aren’t you even a little mad at Lucy? I mean, don’t you think she could’ve – I don’t know – don’t you think it was fucked up, what she put Isabel through? And you too! You kissed, and she acted like it never happened.’

‘So did I,’ Minta said. ‘We were basically children. Did Lucy put you up to this? Is she freaked out or something?’

‘No –’

‘Diana, we can’t talk about Isabel Garcia at six a.m. I’m sorry. Go back to sleep.’

Diana smoked until she was sick and then she ran a couple of miles to remind herself that her experiment with weakness was over. It was Saturday. In a few hours Lucy would call her with that coy, thrilling edge to her voice to ask, ‘Where should we go today?’ – which almost persuaded Diana that she finally belonged in this elevated social realm which she had feared she’d never enter: the realm in which men were rich and women were beautiful, and the frail ugly underbelly of human life was only pavement over which she rode in a powerful car.

 

They went to the Dry Dock Pool. Lucy wore a white swimsuit which was too bright to look at directly, and which Diana could only take in by holding up her camera: Lucy belonged in that little screen. Diana felt the absurdity of having believed she might belong on a little screen, too, at full brightness.

‘God, when Minta said you were special, I had no idea,’ Diana told her when they were in the water.

Lucy smiled without surprise. ‘What do you mean?’

‘You know what I mean,’ Diana said. She swam up to where Lucy sat with her legs dangling at the edge of the pool and pulled herself up between Lucy’s knees. ‘Haven’t you noticed I’m falling for you?’

This was the way to say it to a girl like Lucy: like it was a challenge, like the girl was at risk of being made a fool. You couldn’t be mistaken as a beggar or a suitor. You couldn’t offer it up like a free gift.

‘Are you asking to be my girlfriend?’ Lucy said.

‘I’m not asking,’ Diana said, grinning, so that it was like a joke between them. ‘What else do you think I am?’

Oh, she had been right, right about every single thing. Lucy bit her lip, squeezed her knees around Diana’s waist. Around them were the shouts of ‘No diving!’, the blare of a horn on an adjacent block. Lucy laughed, and then said, with a plump, impish kiss – ‘Well, I guess it’s official.’

In the weeks that followed, when Diana made those love confessions she had never made before and heard Lucy return them, she was thinking of Isabel Garcia. These were the slick lashes Isabel had seen when she admitted her devotion. This was the trembling mouth from which Isabel had heard those impossible words – I love you, I love you – this was the frenzied energy with which Isabel’s face and neck had been covered with kisses. This was the obscene, perfect body which Isabel had lain beneath on the couch in the basement, this was the spot at the small of the waist where Isabel had pressed her hands. Lucy was so intoxicating that in moments Diana almost believed in the love she was imitating, she felt suffused by Isabel’s passion. Then she remembered to ask herself: What had Lucy’s face looked like in the hallway, in the cafeteria, with her boyfriend’s arm slung over her shoulders? Had Isabel been picturing that passing face when Lucy nuzzled her in the basement? When Lucy sighed, had Isabel envisioned her knees on a sticky carpet, blonde strands caught against her cheeks, her mouth stretched around a purple cock?

 

‘Ishould’ve known you’d go for a girl like her,’ Minta said to Diana at their neighborhood diner. By then the summer had meandered into its dog days.

‘A girl like what?’

‘A men’s-fantasy girl. The kind of girl you have to fight over at the bar. Who likes it when men fight over her.’

‘Was that what that whole Isabel story was about?’

‘The thing about Isabel Garcia?’ Minta said. ‘I don’t think so. I appreciated her honesty about all that. What could any of us do back then except try to get through it? Kimmy’s the only person I’ve met who’s all smiles about it,’ she said. Kimmy was her girlfriend. ‘She talks about high school like it was so cozy, just being with her family. And you’ve never complained about those years either. You have no idea what it was like for me and Lucy, the town we grew up in.’ She shook her head, as though to shake herself awake. ‘Has something happened between the two of you?’

‘Not really. I just thought that story was kind of an attention-whore thing.’

Minta rolled her eyes. ‘Come on. You were obsessed with her about ten minutes ago.’

Diana wondered: Did Lucy confide in Minta about the canceled dates – the way Diana sometimes left before midnight, as though she had somewhere else to be – the times Diana screened her calls – the way Diana hid the face of her phone when they lay next to each other? Had Lucy begun to notice?

In the bottom of her mind, where her slender doubt lived, Diana felt again the imperviousness that had sheltered her in the past few years. When she looked at her phone she saw that Lucy had texted her, but she put off responding. Probably Lucy had never waited half a day, let alone a full one, on delivered. But Diana knew how it felt: the rereading, the ambivalence, the follow-up text, the sickening daydreams. What was especially painful was the moment in which that breezy response finally came and immediately it was all rescinded – everything you had felt – the dark and lonely futures you deserved which had opened up before you like tunnels – and within minutes you believed wholeheartedly that you had never worried at all, that you had always been busy, happy, disinterested.

 

On the eve of Lucy’s birthday, in August, Diana arrived on her stoop bearing flowers and a wrapped jewelry box. Lucy answered with surprise. They had been seeing a little less of each other, owing to Diana’s new, contrived avoidance; they had exhausted the local pools. Their relationship had become almost casual again, and because this is not the natural order of intimacy there was an awkwardness to it.

Lucy took the flowers from Diana. They sat at a little table by her kitchen window, the air hot and fragrant, the sounds of the subway serving as gentle reminders to Diana that she belonged to the streets and the underground, as a stray animal belongs. Lucy unwrapped the chain bracelet Diana had brought, and Diana clasped it for her. The sight of Lucy’s fine hand, which Diana had so craved when she had seen it touch the forearm of the bearded man, was overwhelming. She lifted Lucy up onto the windowsill and softly lifted her dress. She breathed to Lucy that she loved her.

Lucy kissed Diana on her cheeks, on her neck.

Diana could feel the presence of doubt glimmering between them, a wariness in the compact, gracious way Lucy held her body. It terrified her that Lucy’s gestures claimed to emanate a warmth which Diana could not feel. Yet this wariness was the effect Diana had hoped for over the previous weeks. She reminded herself that power and terror went hand in hand, that any extreme sense of supremacy or impotence was a place from which other people looked distant and unlikely, and could not be understood.

The next day a picnic was being held in the park to celebrate Lucy’s birthday. Diana went out for beer and arrived late. In the meadow she lingered among her friends, said hello to Minta. Lucy, radiant in a sleeveless red dress, was surrounded by well-wishers and little coolers of ice cream and drinks.

‘She really can be a bit over the top,’ Minta said as she watched Lucy gesticulate, with a frown that made Diana’s heart punch up. It was she who had done this – changed Minta’s mind.

When Lucy finally spotted her Diana steeled herself. She touched her silver ring and dug her heels into the ground. Lucy made her way through two groups of girls, smiling, touching forearms gently, until she reached Diana’s side and leaned forward to kiss her. At that moment Diana put her hands in her pockets and leaned away.

Lucy’s face shifted. Diana could see confusion rise and alongside it something worse – what she thought was resignation – as though, while a part of Lucy could not believe it, another part of her had been expecting this. Once again Lucy moved to embrace Diana and once again Diana leaned away, as if Lucy were contagious.

‘What are you doing?’ Diana said.

Minta was watching them silently. Lucy raised her hand again. It hovered there for a moment.

‘Aren’t you going to wish me a happy birthday?’ she said finally.

Diana laughed and said to Minta, ‘What’s going on with her? She’s obsessed with me.’

Lucy’s waist as she walked away was haunting in its sweetness, so too her shoulders which had grown freckled on their poolside afternoons. Diana closed her eyes against the sight. She heard the faint hiss of a can opening, and Minta’s voice saying, ‘Diana, what the fuck?’

She had wanted urgently for Lucy to comprehend some shadow, at least, of what she herself had inflicted on a girl she claimed to love – some semblance of that anxiety, that despair, finally that violent public rejection, not just rejection but in fact the denial of any involvement at all. Diana was certain that now some essential balance would be restored. It was not for some people to suffer everything, and others nothing. Not while she had her wits and her resources.

She opened her eyes to glimpse Lucy just disappearing over a small hill at the edge of the meadow and felt instead, with gravity, her own regret. The sight of Lucy’s back seemed to radiate pain. This was what she had intended. But for what had she punished Lucy? If not to offer her the chance to step down from her rarified place, deepen her empathy, show she was human?

She found Lucy on a bench beyond the meadow, where the picnickers would not see her. Facing the bench was an artificial lake crossed by a little stone bridge. Diana sat beside Lucy, took her hand between her two palms and kneaded it. Lucy allowed her hand to be taken. The sun moved over Lucy’s cheekbones and lashes, over the red folds of her dress and the skin of the lake. Diana was beginning to comprehend Lucy’s experience: So this was what it felt like to inflict pain and to participate in it. This was what it was to relish power and – she watched pain and shame battling in the jaggedness and trembling of Lucy’s lips – to simultaneously regret it. She felt a profound sense of understanding settle over her, her body anchored itself against the bench, and she held Lucy’s hand more tightly. How could she have been so stupid, how could she have hoped she and Lucy would love each other, when they couldn’t yet understand each other? She had known nothing of Lucy’s effortless power, and Lucy had known nothing of the obscure, miserable frustration of being excluded from the contest of love. She could feel in the tangle of her fingers that Lucy was experiencing this breadth of empathy too. The past seemed to retreat to a small and pivotal place in the distance. Diana would forgive Lucy for the story of Isabel, and Lucy would forgive her for this ruined birthday.

Tears crept down Lucy’s face. She held Diana’s hand more tightly. The bracelet Diana had given her was hot against their entwined wrists. ‘God,’ she said. Diana held her.

‘I have to go back,’ Lucy said then, freeing Diana’s hand.

Diana couldn’t go back over the hill yet. ‘I’ll come tonight,’ she said. Lucy walked with square shoulders, her back held straight.

That evening Diana walked to Lucy’s apartment with a fierce, rare feeling of joy. Tonight Lucy would repent for what she had done to Isabel, and Diana could made amends and show her sincere self to Lucy: the self which had not always been rakish but had once been outcast, the same self which loved Lucy and forgave her. But she found, when she arrived, that there was no answer. Perhaps Lucy had drunk too much at the picnic and passed out already, or lost track of time at some party?

Diana waited half an hour in the warm darkness, aware that she was in the grip of a hopeful, piteous devotion to which she had hoped to be invulnerable. Then she walked home and slept with the windows open.

In the morning she went back to Lucy’s. The sun moved over her, and she felt hopeful and lightly sick. She rang Lucy’s bell four times. Finally Lucy appeared on the stoop. She was still wearing the red dress, though it had suffered some grass stains since the previous afternoon. Diana remembered the immaculate desire she had felt when she first encountered Lucy, fervent and doubtless, and the greedy pleasure of watching her bewitch a whole room. She reached out to embrace her.

‘Don’t touch me!’ Lucy said, pushing the hand away. Her face was tight. ‘Why are you here? Why the fuck are you here right now?’

‘Won’t you just have a cigarette with me?’ Diana said, after a moment. ‘Please, come outside?’

They walked a block in silence. At the corner Diana bought a pack and a lighter and they stood under the bodega sign together in a raw breeze. Lucy’s lashes were clumped together a little, but Diana loved her no less.

‘Why are you here?’ Lucy said, waving the lighter around. ‘You’ve been shitty to me for a month! And what the fuck was that in the park yesterday? Okay, I get it, you don’t want to be with me anymore, but did you have to shit on me in front of my friends, on my fucking birthday? Couldn’t you just tell me like a human being?’

‘But that’s not what’s going on, not at all,’ Diana said. ‘I do want to be with you, I just – I thought –’ and she stopped. She looked at Lucy. ‘You don’t understand,’ she said, ‘do you? This is about Isabel.’

‘Isabel?’ said Lucy. ‘Isabel who?’

‘Isabel Garcia!’

Lucy squinted at Diana. ‘Do you know her?’ she said. ‘Do you know Isabel from somewhere?’

‘No, I was trying to show you – I wanted you to understand. About high school. What it was like for Isabel. What it felt like if you were gay then, and if you –’

‘High school?’ Lucy flicked ashes onto Diana’s shirt. ‘High school?’

 

Diana could make it over the bridge, out of Manhattan, all the way down to Sunset Pool. She knew where the river was; it had only switched sides.

If she lay on her back at the poolside and braced the concrete, with a shirt draped over her face to shield the sun, she became a part of the wide, generous summer. She could hear the size of the pool, the moods of the children shouting, the little dives that splashed the water up and the obligatory shouts of the lifeguards. Early September: The air had a bright, soft sound to it. The cry of the whistle was silver.

When the sun had exhausted her, she gathered her things and went to the bank of showers. She rinsed her face in the stream. She heard the slap of flip-flops, the dull sound of metal keys. Then she heard the voice she knew was Minta’s saying, ‘No, put that under the towel, over there.’

She turned and saw Minta and her girlfriend, still dry, with their arms full of towels and magazines.

She shook the water from her hair and moved toward Minta. She didn’t feel afraid. She had crossed the bridge and drunk up all that light. Adulthood was more forgiving. ‘Hey,’ she said, and touched Minta’s arm. Minta turned toward her. Her cheeks grew taut with surprise, the aging looseness of her face disappeared, and as her mouth curled with disgust she looked as fresh and livid as she must have at sixteen."

    "text": "It’s 11:03 now, so Betty Lane is late. I’m waiting in my rented Ford Escape – its AC sputtering through the early June heat – thinking of calling again or maybe abandoning my attempt to get inside Jane’s house. Hers is the last on this cul-de-sac, a street lined with mini mansions that mirror one another. I thought Jane would hate the suburbs, how one house blends into the next. But sitting here, I can understand the appeal. It’s nice to be alike, to be so similar you’re almost one.

Three weeks ago, I left the city. I’d planned to knock on Jane’s door, to try and reconnect, to repair what had been broken. But as I was pacing this street, working myself up to it, I heard a garage open, and there she was. I ducked behind the neighbors’ hedges and watched her walk down the driveway. Through the boxwood, I could tell her hair was several bottles blonder. She looked like she’d gained weight. Her eyebrows were thicker, darker, maybe laminated. She was wearing a pink sundress – she hates pink – and I realized as she picked up the newspaper how much time could pass in a year. It occurred to me that I no longer knew her.

So I booked myself a room at the Motel 6 and I waited. Until I learned more, until I understood why she’d left. Until this morning, when I found that a ‘for sale’ sign had, overnight, materialized on her lawn. The poster – a woman’s headshot, eyes blown up to ten times their natural size, lips big and red, wet with parabens – said ‘Betty Lane Real Estate’ in small script, followed by a telephone number.

When I called Betty about a tour, I used my best accent. I’d be a southern housewife after Jessica Tandy in Driving Miss Daisy, which I’d just watched at the motel. As I waited for Betty to check her schedule – acrylic nails click-clacking against computer keys – I considered my character like we’d done in theater school. Who was she? What did she want?

‘I can put you down for eleven this morning,’ Betty interrupted. ‘Your name again?’

‘Jessica,’ I said, committing. ‘Jessica Tandy.’

My phone reads 11:09. I thumb aimlessly through the pages of apps, forward then back, hovering above the mail icon before pressing it. One of my clients has messaged a third time about her new installation in Bushwick that’s been panned. Another is worried about the growing hate he’s received after copying a small creator on Etsy. Unread emails: 62. Outside of New York, I found it difficult to care. I watch the screen go black only for another ping to illuminate it. Doing PR for artists has to be a kind of masochism.

I wipe the sweat off my upper lip, chuck the phone into a cup holder. This was a mistake. What do I expect Jane’s house will reveal? Why she cut me off? Proof she hadn’t meant to? With a hand on the gear shift, now slick with moisture, I’m about to put the car into drive when a knock echoes off my passenger-side window. Peering inside, clad in an ill-fitting black pantsuit, is Betty Lane. Her eyes are smaller in person. She wears no lipstick, has no acrylic nails. What’s more, her belly is swollen to the size of a cantaloupe. I press the window switch, and we both watch the glass jerk awkwardly down.

‘Jessica?’

‘Yes?’ I say, sweeping the curls out of my eyes. ‘How’d you know it was me?’

‘Well . . .’ She glances around the empty street. ‘No one else here, ma’am.’

‘Silly me, sometimes I, uh, ain’t got the sense God gave a lemon!’

Betty coughs politely. ‘Shall we?’

I reluctantly release the wet gear shift and get out of the car, drying my hand on my pants. Following Betty up the drive, I stay several feet behind, stopping on the porch as she approaches Jane’s door. Flanked by two artificial ferns, she begins fishing around her large leather tote while I scan the road, tapping one of my sneakers, suddenly aware they don’t match my blazer and slacks, suddenly aware that they’ve just stepped from asphalt to wood, crossing the line between my space and Jane’s.

I shouldn’t worry. It’s a Monday and Jane is a teacher. Her husband, David, is a banker. She leaves the house at 6:45 a.m., and he leaves at dawn, no matter the season. Jane used to call this admirable, but I call it obsessive, maybe self-obsessed. Because, honestly, is driving in your climate-controlled Tesla to sit in a plush office of latte-delivering interns that hard? No, it’s not.

What is hard? Dealing with sickly, sticky five-year-olds who poop their pants for attention and guzzle Elmer’s glue like tequila. From what I’ve glimpsed over these three weeks, Jane gets to work before all the other teachers, parking in the farthest spot. In the classroom, she cleans each child’s desk with Lysol, knowing Crayola will soon replace Lemon Breeze. Then she writes a lesson plan on the board, eats two hard-boiled eggs, and sips matcha until her first child arrives.

Betty finds Jane and David’s key and sticks it in the lock, pushing open the heavy mahogany door. The cold air hits us instantly, clings to our skin. I’ve seen pictures of the house, but Zillow doesn’t do it justice: the foyer is massive with sparkling, black-and-white tiles, an ornate staircase that leads to a visible second floor, a crystal chandelier suspended above it all.

I try to appear like I’m considering the space and say, ‘It’ll be small for me, but maybe it’s got a good pool?’

‘No pool,’ Betty says, leading me deeper into the house. The hall seems to stretch forever, like that scene in The Shining. ‘But it has an open floor plan and this nice crown molding throughout. The foundations are from 1901 . . .’

If they don’t have a pool, David must workout at Equinox, but I’ve only seen him there twice – once two Saturdays prior and again last Wednesday after work. When she met him four years ago, Jane told me David would swim laps every day for hours. As we shared a carton of pad thai on our lumpy futon, she explained how he hated the feeling of being sweaty or sticky, of looking to the outside world as if he was exerting any effort. I told her this was a red flag, but she disagreed. She thought that he was ‘so smart’, the way he kept up appearances ‘so impressive’. While the other guys she’d dated couldn’t be bothered to match their socks, clean the pink rings growing in their toilet bowls.

‘What’s the price again?’ I ask Betty, already knowing.

She brings us into the kitchen, a sterile space with white walls and white marble countertops, everything stainless steel, faux aluminium brick flooring, the table and chairs two different shades of grey. ‘It’s listed at 1.5,’ she says, ‘but they’re open to offers. Only been here seven months.’ Then she points to the double dishwashers. ‘See those?’

I nod as if my third-floor walk-up – the one I shared with Jane – has one let alone two. ‘Huh, I’d expected higher. You see, my late husband, Richard –’ I let out a small sigh. ‘Forgive me. The life insurance policy he left was, let’s call it, extraordinarily fair.’

‘I’m sorry to hear that.’ Betty sticks out her lower lip, pouting. But it’s only for half a second, then she’s turning toward the sink, earnestly explaining about the ‘high-end’ garbage disposal, and now my fake, dead husband is really dead. She flicks on the disposal, and we listen to it consume whatever Jane and David had for dinner. Chicken, I think, probably dry. Jane isn’t a good cook. I cooked for us, starting from the day we met.

I’d moved to our dreary Detroit suburb for sixth grade and, after a month, still hadn’t made friends, which shouldn’t be surprising since I was a twelve-year-old girl with a buzz cut. In my last school, a military school, the boys copied their fathers, and no one minded when I copied the boys (even though I didn’t have a father and my mother, a Lieutenant Colonel, had bushy, brown hair). In Detroit, everyone asked if I had cancer. When I said no, they stayed far away.

My mother was rarely home, so if someone knocked on our door, I usually didn’t answer. But one day I did, and there was Jane, blonde hair in two braids, summer freckles dusting her nose and cheeks. Her left hand was in her pocket, her right stuck out for me to shake. ‘I’m your neighbor,’ she said. ‘Cool hair. Mind if I hang out here?’ But she was already walking past me.

I made us a box of Kraft Mac & Cheese, and we watched the newest episode of Hannah Montana. ‘The Best of Both Worlds’ hummed in the background as Jane scrutinized my head. ‘Are you sure you don’t have cancer?’

I rubbed my stubble. ‘Yep, pretty sure.’ A beat passed between us as I shifted on the leather couch. ‘Why’d you come over?’

She seemed unsure for a moment and chewed at her top lip. ‘My parents are fighting. They’ll get over it, but the screaming, it kind of hurts my ears.’

I nodded like I knew.

The next day, Jane returned; they were yelling again. She came three nights later, then two nights after that, and soon we devised a system so that I would have the Kraft and the DVR ready. Jane’s mother loved flowers, but her father was allergic, so they had fake plants around the house, mostly plastic tulips. One white tulip on a vase in the kitchen windowsill facing ours meant Jane was alone, everything was good. Yellow meant her parents were coexisting. Pink was DEFCON 1. When she left a pink tulip, I started boiling the water.

Jane never mentioned my cancer again. Instead, when a girl from class asked how my chemo was going, Jane gave her crooked bangs. When, in eighth grade, I was passed over for the lead in The Wizard of Oz, Jane had us TP the director’s house and then film our own version in which I was Dorothy, she the scarecrow, tin man, and lion. When no one asked me to junior prom, she turned down three proposals and bought us matching corsages. When, at eighteen, I slept alone several nights a week – Mom’s work increasingly demanding travel – Jane practically moved in. She said she never wanted me to feel lonely.

For seven years, she left tulips on her kitchen windowsill each night. For seven years, I was ready to receive ‘DEFCON Pink,’ as we came to call it. I was ready with macaroni, Disney, oblivion: a blank space to relieve the voices she was escaping from. Because in that empty house, Jane became my sound, and I became her silence.

The kitchen opens into the living room: an Ikea-style coffee table, a heavy, peach carpet, an off-white sofa covered in protective plastic wrap. There’s a vase of flowers on the table, but they’re lilies, not tulips, and they’re purple, which never meant anything. Scuffmarks litter the wood, and rings from cold drinks tattoo its edges despite a neat pile of coasters there in the center.

I scan the room, desperate for anything to indicate Jane misses me. I run my fingers along the sofa’s plastic; the cushions look like they’re being suffocated. Betty assures it’s only for tours and don’t worry there’s no critters here. ‘Take a seat,’ she says. ‘Kick your feet up.’

But when I try and sit, I’m repelled back. I squirm and the plastic crinkles. I put one foot on the table, then the other, getting comfortable, which makes Betty gasp a little and I realize, too late, that she wasn’t serious. ‘Maybe we should move to the bedrooms,’ she says. But it’s hard to notice or care because there’s a 75-inch flatscreen in front of me and not a painting in sight.

Jane first became passionate about art, specifically Renaissance art, during our freshman year at NYU. I was an actor, convinced I would make it to Broadway, devoting all my time to rehearsal. But the longer Jane spent in the art department, the less we were together. I asked her to volunteer on the crew, as an usher. She had no interest. She still came to every show, still cyberbullied any publication that gave me a bad review. By that point, I was used to capitulating to her. So I gave in: I double majored in art history.

After graduation, Jane got a job working HR at Christie’s, while I did small roles off-Broadway. She’d claim she wanted to get her master’s, to be a professor of art. Yet every year the deadlines came and went until, finally, I applied with her. I was accepted at Columbia, Fordham, Brooklyn College, and the New School. Jane got into Fordham. When I put down my deposit, she said she was just waiting for her next pay check.

But between pay checks, Jane met David at a dimly lit bar near our apartment. She liked to go there and drink Moscato and read, mostly Woolf, Plath, and Dickinson. Only depressing, dead women who’d been institutionalized, Jane said, or should have been. She thought it was romantic, sipping cheap white wine on a Tuesday, filling her brain with haunting, feminine worlds.

That night, as Jane told it, David sat on the wooden stool beside hers and cracked open a copy of Infinite Jest. She noted this and cleared her throat, slightly arched her back. When he turned, though, he stared into her eyes, not at her chest. After several drinks, she knew she’d met her husband; he was almost too handsome, too perfect.

Within six months, Jane and David were engaged. And then there was a wedding to plan, and our apartment became a flurry of sample invitations on heavy paper, stacks of wedding dress catalogs, doll-like squares of chocolate cake and red velvet cake and carrot cake. And suddenly the Renaissance was out, and bar napkins, flower arrangements, and thin, champagne-colored, paper straws were in. Graduate courses were too much work, Jane said, plus David made a lot of money. I went to Fordham alone.

‘What about our deal?’ I asked Jane as we bubble-wrapped kitchenware the week before her move.

I reminded her of the vow we exchanged in the girl’s third-floor bathroom during homecoming our senior year of high school. The DJ’s bass thumping through tiled walls, the putrid smell of puke mixing with hairspray like toxic sludge, me dabbing lines of mascara on her cheeks while she cursed Tommy Allen for kissing another girl on the dance floor. We swore never to trust men, never to get married. We swore we’d be each other’s family, forever.

‘We were just girls,’ Jane said. ‘We were just saying things.’

‘But what about me?’ I asked.

‘What about you?’

‘I’ll be alone.’

Jane picked up a rusted wine opener and considered it thoughtfully. ‘Have you tried Hinge?’

‘I’m serious. What’s going to happen to us?’

‘Seriously, you’re my best friend. Nothing’s going to happen to us.’

I remember feeling assured by her crooked smile. Like I was silly for thinking otherwise, like I was crazy for imagining she might slip away.

So tell me why it’s been a year since Jane and I last spoke. Tell me if I’m crazy.

Back in the foyer, Betty and I study the open walk-in closet. Jane and David’s coats hang limp in the murky space, like skins waiting to be inhabited. ‘There’s eight closets total,’ Betty says proudly, nodding at the sparsely filled rack. Then she closes the door and proceeds to the stairs, brushing past a skinny entryway console filled with takeout menus, junk mail, and two framed pictures: one of Jane and David in front of the London Eye, another at the top of Machu Picchu, their arms raised.

‘And how many bedrooms?’ I ask. The answer is four. I grip the staircase’s metal banister with one hand and lean back a little, testing its weight, feeling like Gene Kelly.

‘Four plus an office connected to the master,’ she says, kitten heels clapping on the stairs. ‘They meant to make it a nursery.’

‘Are they pregnant?’ I ask, swinging back and forth, staring at Jane’s sweaty face in front of the ancient Incan city. Her lululemon leggings and zip-up. I couldn’t even get her to run.

‘I think they’re trying,’ Betty says as she reaches the top landing. When she turns and finds I’m still there at the bottom, she gets this impatient or maybe concerned look on her face. It makes my stomach knot, the tension, the need to unravel it. Our height difference is funny, I think, like she’s Queen Elizabeth and I’m her peasant, and so I pretend to do the royal wave, cupping my palm and toggling it left then right, left then right.

Betty only clears her throat.

I drop my hand and take the stairs two at a time. When we’re facing each other, me huffing from the climb, I point at her stomach and have another go: ‘I see you tried too.’ At this, Betty’s face goes red, and she waddles off.

Two weeks after their honeymoon at the Ritz-Carlton Reserve in Dorado Beach, Jane told me she and David were ‘trying’, which meant she’d officially given up on Fordham, officially abandoned our pact. Still, I kept my mouth shut. I bought her birthing books, a basal body thermometer to track ovulation, unnaturally tiny hats in yellow and green. I sent her articles on diet and male fertility, lists of the leafy greens and legumes David should eat to give them a baby with a high IQ.

But it didn’t matter because Jane and David tried to no avail: no pink line, no smiley face on the pee-stained stick. They tried with the help of doctors, holistic nutritionists and, once, a hypnotist. They tried in their Brooklyn apartment, in a London hotel room, in a tree house at their third spa retreat, and in David’s Times Square office, watching as the New Year’s Eve ball dropped. They tried for six months, eight months, a year.

At the start, I called Jane every day. She picked up right after sometimes, still panting as she described the positions they’d tried in, what was scientifically better for the gamete to reach the oviduct and link up with an oocyte. I felt more connected to her than at any time in our adult lives, but especially in the months since she’d moved. I figured that this baby would be my bridge. She’d ask me to nanny. She’d ask me to be godmother. I’d become a part of rather than outside of the family she was growing.

Then, after several months, Jane stopped answering every day. She answered every other day. Once a week. Every two weeks. She was probably embarrassed, upset. So I texted too. I DM’d, Snapchatted, and Facebook messaged. I used LinkedIn once. No, twice.

After a particularly long stretch of silence, we met for lunch, Jane’s idea. She brought David, which wasn’t unexpected. I hadn’t seen her alone since the wedding. For twenty minutes, he talked about hedge ratios, derivative securities, and busted convertibles, which has nothing to do with cars, and I sipped my wine and smiled and nodded when Jane did.

When he eventually went to the bathroom, I leaned across the table. ‘You understand this stuff?’

‘No, but he gets so excited,’ Jane said, breaking her bread in two and mashing it against her olive oil-drenched plate. ‘I bought one of those For Dummies books.’ She popped the bread into her mouth and wiped her fingers on the tablecloth.

‘You aren’t bored?’

‘I think it’s sweet. It reminds me of you and those shows. All the jargon.’

I laughed uncomfortably, thought back on how she listened to me describe the merits of method acting, the differences in stage lighting, how I believe ‘break a leg’ is an insult.

‘The real reason for this lunch,’ she said, looking toward the bathroom, ‘is I wanted to tell you to cool it. On the texts? The calls? I know you’re excited about . . .’ She gripped her stomach. ‘Our trying, but I need some space, some time away.’

I concentrated on the oil coating her lips. I wanted to reach out and rub it off. Instead, I slid my hands under my butt. ‘Time away from me?’

‘Yes,’ she said, staring intently at the oil pool. ‘Yes.’

I limited myself to one call a week, to texting every two days. It was like a diet, a Jane diet. It was the newness of space, the extra air that I found most affecting. Without her, everything felt emptier, as if she’d vacuumed up the corners of my life. The reality was I didn’t have many friends: they were Jane’s friends. I didn’t have places I liked to go or things I liked to do. They were her places, her things.

Admittedly, I broke my diet often, calling and texting when I shouldn’t have. Because, sometimes, she did reply, with a word or two. But then, later, even these monosyllables dried up. I was sending text messages that never delivered, writing emails that bounced back, just to feel close to her. I kept up with her fertility journey online until I couldn’t find her profiles. I made new accounts to test if it was a problem with my phone, but she’d disappear again. I filed reports with Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook and never heard back.

After two years, I’d been through three Craigslist roommates while Jane and David were pregnant zero times. I tried to throw myself into work, but I felt my concentration melting away, my worries about gallery openings and exhibits becoming worries about Jane. What was she doing? People used to say I was precise, exact, obsessively committed. I was.

I mailed a lengthy letter to Jane and David’s address and, finally, got my response. It was a text that said a lot of things, some nicer than others, but mostly that Jane was cutting me off.

She said David might pursue legal action if I continued to contact them, to show up where I wasn’t invited. Her last line: please, stop.

Betty moves with her stomach pushed out, and it reminds me of a toddler learning to walk, bumbling around as if on stilts. I follow as she wobbles into the master bedroom: a king-size bed, two matching bedside tables, a second 75-inch mounted on the wall, a door, barely ajar, to a smaller room with a cream-colored rocking chair and several unopened boxes. Through the wilting cardboard handles, I see something fluffy and brown.

‘So,’ I say, picking up a thick book on, I assume, David’s side. ‘Do you know why they’re selling?’

Betty eyes me and laughs in clumsy breathes. ‘I, uh, promise it’s nothing wrong with the house.’ She enters the en suite bathroom, motioning for me to follow. ‘They’re moving to Iowa, I think.’ Everything is blinding white tiles and light wood. ‘Or maybe it’s Indiana? The husband’s got some big new job.’ Three digital panels manage at least four temperature gauges. Betty leans against one, her elbow pressed on the upwards arrow until the screen says 86 degrees and my feet begin to burn. ‘Nice guy, the husband. Now how about this rain shower?’

It was always about David. When Jane and I still talked, David was the reason we couldn’t hang out. David has a work event. David’s too tired. David thinks we should take it easy tonight. David had invaded our lives so completely he was like that alien who impregnates one of the crew, bursts out of the guy’s chest, and takes over the spaceship.

David had taken over our ship.

After that text, when Jane’s silence became prolonged, profound, inescapable, this idea about him solidified, convincing me to show up outside their sprawling, three-bedroom in Williamsburg. I remember the Ring camera leering above the bell, pressing that thick, black button, Jane opening the door in a fuchsia robe, blonde hair piled in a messy bun. Her makeup was done, but she looked bloated, heavy.

‘What are you doing here?’ She turned to search behind her shoulder.

‘I’m glad you’re alive,’ I replied, reaching for her cheek.

She pushed the hand away as David appeared. He was a tall, gangly man. Jane would say he was kind, intelligent, funny, but I couldn’t see it, the personality she claimed he had. He was always overly polite, always enunciated words. He liked Catan and pickleball. He believed in the efficacy of blue light glasses, thought crypto was the future and running was passé. Didn’t that just make him Elon Musk?

‘Nice to see you,’ he said stiffly, squeezing Jane’s arm. When he leaned down to whisper in her ear, I saw she became uncomfortable, shifting from foot to foot. It was in that moment I realized: David knew what I’d said about him. Now he was whispering in her ear that I was the problem, that I was the one who had to go. As Jane glanced between us, a yearning in her eyes, I clocked her pink robe again. Was this is a mayday, a new cipher for DEFCON Pink? I was almost positive she was asking for help.

David pulled back, grimacing as he looked me over, then went inside. When he was gone, I gathered my friend’s hands in mine. ‘You have to believe,’ I said, ‘nothing he says about me is true.’

Jane began crying, hysterical and snot-filled sobs. I wanted so badly to reach out to her, to hold her, but she said, ‘I need you to seek help, like real help. You’re not right, you know? I’ve been trying to say it nicely.’

My vision turned blurry. ‘You tried to say what nicely?’

‘That I can’t breathe.’ She inhaled dramatically, rubbed her cheeks. Then she glared at me and twisted her mouth into this hard, mean line I’d never seen before. ‘If you come back, I’ll call the cops. I’m sorry, I’m sorry,’ she repeated as she closed the door in my face. The reclaimed wood hit my nose.

I tried to do what Jane said, ‘seek help.’ I got a therapist – actually, a team of them. One for alternating days of the week because I was that serious. I told each therapist what happened, and they all came back with an alphabet soup of scientific diagnoses, but it really boiled down to one: stalking. I was, apparently, ‘stalking’ Jane. Two psychiatrists wrote prescriptions I didn’t fill, and the others asked me to talk, which I preferred. I talked about my childhood, my lack of family and friends, my failing PR business, my failed dreams. It didn’t matter. When they repeated that word, ‘stalking’, it didn’t click. Because you can’t stalk your best friend. You can’t stalk the person you lived with for ten years, the person who held you when your mom died, the person who woke you up because she was afraid to fall asleep alone, because the blaring ambulances and the honking horns reminded her of her parents’ raised voices.

Months later, when I ghosted the last therapist, I returned to Williamsburg. But Jane’s landlord said they’d moved. To the suburbs, he thought. I knew the office where David worked. And so, one day, I decided to rent the Ford Escape, to tail David’s Tesla up Broadway and onto the highway, across the GW Bridge, home to New Jersey.

I was going to wait and watch until I found something to prove that I wasn’t crazy, that Jane needed me.

As Betty points out the bathtub’s multiple jacuzzi settings, I think about what I’ll say to Jane when I bump into her at the grocery store – the one she visits twice a week – or the park where she goes jogging. I’ll tell her to come home, that she can sneak out like she used to. That he can’t keep us apart any longer. Maybe I’ll leave a Polaroid of us on her bedside table, a folded-up note in her La Mer night cream, just so she knows I’m close. I wonder if they have tulips in the backyard. I’ll put one on the kitchen windowsill. I’ll activate DEFCON Pink, remind her that we took care of one another, remind her that she’s living the life we vowed to avoid. Jane called these people sad, the ones who walk around eating, drinking, working, fucking on a schedule. But here she is, rising at six o’clock, driving to school, leaving school, going to the grocery store, buying corn flakes and sliced ham, driving home. No art or culture, no urban sounds or rural silence. The suburb exists somewhere in the middle, I think, like purgatory.

There’s only one deviation I’ve noticed in Jane’s routine. The last three Fridays, she and David have gone to a fertility center during lunch. It’s never been the same office, but Jane will always come out sniffling, and David will always hold her tightly, tenderly. If I use the binoculars I store in my Ford, I can see that he’ll shed a tear too, saying something to conjure a glimmer of hope in her eyes. They’ll embrace and he’ll whisper in her ear. She’ll shudder and fall deeper into his arms.

In the master bedroom, Betty flags another gaudy crystal chandelier, and I have to cover my mouth to keep from laughing. I can tell she’s looking at me funny when she says, ‘What do you think?’

‘It’s perfect. Thank you . . . for all the information.’

Her eye twitches, and there’s a beat of uneasy silence. So I smile, at her face and then at her stomach. ‘When are you due?’

‘Oh,’ she says and squints at her belly, ‘I’m not –’

Just then, there’s a dinging sound indicating the front door has opened. It paralyzes us, traps us like ants in glue. We listen to it ring, inspecting each other over the quilted sheets until finally Betty says, ‘I didn’t think anyone would be here.’ She shuffles eagerly to the doorframe and pops her head out. ‘We’re upstairs, down in a minute!’

‘They’re home?’ I feel a hand going to my chest.

The realtor surveys me again, smiles with one corner of her mouth. ‘Maybe they wanted to meet their prospective buyer?’

I nod. I try to as I follow her out of the room. But I’m more focused on how hard my heart is beating.

Betty starts down the stairs, holding her empty stomach with one hand and the banister with the other. I pause at the top, scanning for an open window. I can see Jane and David below hanging up their light jackets. Jane looks so beautiful and so sad, dressed in a pink wrap dress. She’s wiping tears and David’s rubbing her back, his fingers tangled in her hair.

‘We’ll try again,’ I hear him say, his voice echoing, reaching every crown-molded corner of the room. ‘We’ll try again.’

This isn’t right. This isn’t how it’s supposed to happen.

‘Hello there,’ Betty says as she reaches them, unable to read their private moment.

It’s not even Friday. It’s Monday.

They turn and face her, and me, just as I’ve descended the first step.

Jane stiffens. ‘Emma?’

David’s mouth hangs open.

Betty glances between the three of us, smile faltering. ‘This is, uh, Jessica Tandy,’ she says, gesturing up at me. ‘The woman I told you about, Jane.’

Jane’s eyes are wide. ‘Grab your phone,’ she whispers to David.

David’s hands are still enmeshed in her hair, like a marionettist fumbling with the strings.

Betty Lane is twirling her necklace, its metal chain cutting off her circulation in real time.

‘The police,’ Jane says, frowning at David, eyes breaking from mine. ‘Mention the restraining order.’

David isn’t moving, and it’s upsetting Jane. I want to make her laugh, so I say, ‘Tell them it’s DEFCON Pink.’ Then I lift my hand and give them the royal wave.

    "text": "Ihave to write about her before I begin to forget her. Because I’ll have to forget her if I want to resume my old peaceful life.

Because that’s what I’d really like to do: live in peace, without fear or memory. It’s enough for me to run my household as I did before, to care for the children and look out of the window into the garden. If one behaves calmly, I thought, one cannot get involved in other people’s business. And I thought of Wolfgang. It was so nice having him around me every day. Should I have endangered our peaceful companionship over Stella?

No, things couldn’t have ended worse for me if I had. Stella is avenging herself on me, and taking from me the only thing to which my heart still clings. But that’s nonsense. Stella can’t take her revenge, she was already so helpless when she was alive, how helpless she must be now. I am taking Stella’s revenge on myself, that’s the truth, and it’s as it should be, however much I might try to resist.

Of course I’ve always known that the day would come, it didn’t need Stella for that to happen. Sooner or later Wolfgang would have been lost to me. He’s one of those people who has no illusions and accepts the consequences. I don’t have any illusions either, but I live as if I did. I used to think I could start over again from the beginning, but it’s much too late for that now, in fact it was always too late for that, except I didn’t want to acknowledge it.

There could no longer be any point in anything, because Wolfgang moved away from me. And that’s good for him.

I read somewhere that you can get used to anything, and habit is the strongest force in our lives. I don’t believe it. It’s only the excuse that we need to keep from thinking about the suffering of our fellow human beings, or indeed about our own suffering. It’s only the excuse that we need to stop thinking about our own suffering. It’s true, a human being can endure a lot, not only out of habit, but because a faint spark glimmers within them, which they secretly hope will one day allow them to break the habit. The fact that they usually can’t, out of weakness and cowardice, does not speak against it. Or are there perhaps two kinds of people, those who get used to things and those who aren’t able to? I can’t believe that; it’s probably just a matter of constitution. Once we reach a certain age, we are gripped by anxiety and try to fight against it in some way. We sense that we’re in a hopeless position, and make desperate little attempts to escape.

If the first of these attempts is unsuccessful, as it generally is, we surrender until the next one, which will already be weaker, and which will leave us feeling still more miserable and defeated.

So Richard regularly drinks his red wine, chases after women and money, my friend Luise pursues men who are young enough to be her son, and I stand at the window and stare into the garden. Stella, that stupid young person, escaped successfully on her first attempt.

I would much prefer it if I could switch places with her, if I didn’t have to sit here and write her pitiful story, which is also my pitiful story. I would much prefer to be dead like her, and not have to hear the little bird crying. Why does no one protect me against its cry, against dead Stella and the agonising red of the tulips on the chest of drawers? I don’t like red flowers.

My colour is blue. It gives me courage, and detaches everyone and everything from me. Richard thinks I only wear my blue clothes because they suit my face; he doesn’t know that I wear them for protection. No one can hurt me when I’m wearing them. The blue keeps everything far away from me. Stella loved red and yellow, and it was in the red dress I gave her that she ran in front of a yellow-painted truck.

That radiantly yellow death that hurtled towards her like a sun, I think it was beautiful and terrible like the death we know from the ancient legends.

I had to identify her. Her face was unharmed, but greenish-white and much smaller than it had seemed to me when she was alive. The disturbed and half-deranged expression of the last few days had fled from it, making way for an icy silence.

Stella had always been a little clumsy and shy, and even when she was cheerful, her regular, wide face was immobile. Then it blossomed from within to her lips. Stella had been very happy for a short time, but she was unable to learn the rules of the game, she couldn’t adapt and she had to perish.

A frivolous and greedy mother had stuck her in a boarding school as a child. I remember observing her then, about five years ago, in church. She knelt beside me, her face turned towards the monstrance, her eyes wide open, her lips arched slightly forwards, open and devoted. And with the same expression she later stared at the evening paper behind which Richard’s face was hidden. Wolfgang saw it too. He blushed and grew pale, and finally he choked on something to distract my attention from Stella. At fifteen he knew just as well as I did what was happening in front of our eyes, and he was trying desperately to protect me from that knowledge, while my sole concern was keeping him out of the game, and so I did exactly what I shouldn’t have done, namely nothing.

While Stella, unable to conceal her single big emotion, slipped inexorably into her disaster and Richard tried to deceive us with his smooth bonhomie, I made an effort to remain oblivious to everything. For Wolfgang’s sake and also for mine, because there’s nothing I hate more than scenes and arguments, and even a tense atmosphere is enough to leave me disturbed and uneasy for weeks.

The loneliness and peace of my room, the view of the garden, the tenderness that filled me at the sight of Wolfgang, was I supposed to put everything – and for me it is everything – at risk for the sake of a girl who ran dully and inexorably into her fate, condemned from the very beginning to be broken, with her simple, foolish emotion, by our disintegrating, divided world?

Well, it wasn’t worth my trouble, but it should have been, because Stella’s was the young life that I allowed to run headlong into a murderous, metal machine.

One can perish in very different ways, out of stupidity just as easily as out of an excess of caution; the former seems more worthy to me, but it is not my way.

Luise, Stella’s mother, didn’t come until after the funeral. She’d been travelling, and nobody from her little provincial town knew where she had gone. By the time we were finally able to contact her it was all over. Richard had sorted it all out, well and appropriately, as he tends to sort everything out. Luise, and incidentally she had been with her boyfriend, a young postgrad student, in Italy, now sat facing us in our sitting room, sobbing.

Richard gave her platitudes, which sound more convincing from his lips than from mine, words of genuine sympathy. His eyes were deep blue and moist, as they are when he is agitated or drunk, and I couldn’t help thinking of the wreaths on the bare hill. There weren’t many wreaths, by the way, because in this town Stella had only us and a few friends from school. I thought of the hill and of Stella’s body, bled dry and crushed, in its wooden prison. For the first time I was filled with pity. It was foolish and absurd, because Stella was dead, and yet pity swelled within me like a physical pain that sat like a lump in my chest and radiated all the way to my fingers. And yet that pain was no longer meant for Stella, but for her dead body, which was now doomed to decay.

I heard Richard talking, but didn’t understand any of what he was saying. Gripped with horror, I only saw his eyes, which were so moist and alive. Every hair of him was alive, his skin, his breath, his hands, and the sight of it took my breath away.

Seen from outside, we were a middle-aged couple trying to comfort a mother who was bent with pain. Except Luise is not a mother bent with pain. Stella’s death was very timely for her. We knew that, and she knew we knew, but she sobbed and wept as her role demanded.

Now that Stella’s legacy, the pharmacy, has come to her, Luise can marry her postgrad, who would never have taken her without the dowry. She can buy this strong young man and persuade herself for a while that she was lucky.

Stella had become a burden to us all, an obstacle that had finally been cleared out of the way. Of course it would have been even better if she’d had a happy marriage, emigrated, or otherwise somehow disappeared from our field of vision. But she had disappeared at any rate, and we were able to forget her for once and for all.

I could tell by looking at Richard just how much he’d forgotten her already, since for him forgetting is a physical thing. His body has already forgotten Stella; tall, broad, and hungry for new women and new sensations, he sat next to me and patted Luise’s thin bird fingers with his broad well-tended hand, which is always dry, warm, and pleasant to the touch.

And Luise’s whimpering fell silent under that warmth, under the sound of his calming voice.

‘I always told her,’ she groaned, ‘pay attention when you’re crossing the road. I would just like to know what she was thinking of.’

‘Yes,’ Richard said sorrowfully, ‘we would like to know that too, wouldn’t we, Anna?’

He looked at me and I nodded. There wasn’t even a hint of irony in his voice. I apologised and said that I needed to check on the kitchen. I didn’t go into the kitchen, however, but into the bathroom and started putting on a bit of rouge. Pallor doesn’t suit me.

Stella had been pale in the last few weeks too, but she was nineteen, and suffering refined her face, making it more adult and charming. A woman over thirty needs to be able to stop suffering, it doesn’t do anything good to her appearance by then.

When Stella came to us, her skin was slightly tanned. She was beautiful, but lacking in charm and grace. She was a bit too healthy and strong for modern tastes. Indeed, it later took a heavy truck to crush the life out of her body. It was so considerate of Stella to make the whole thing look like an accident. And it showed how little Luise had known her daughter that she believed she had stepped off the curb unintentionally. Because Stella’s dreaminess was that of a sleepy, strong, young animal finding its way through the bustle of the city as if in a trance. Not even the driver of the truck, a simple, ignorant young man, believed it was an accident. Stella wanted to die, and with the same unreflective self-abandonment with which she had once dropped into life, she fell out of the same life that had neglected to hold on to her with a bit of love, kindness, and patience. We have cause for gratitude. How embarrassing it would have been had she taken sleeping pills or thrown herself out of a window. Her elegance, which was an elegance of the heart, showed itself in the manner of her death, giving us all the opportunity to believe in a meaningless accident.

But what use is all of this if the only person who should really have believed it does not believe it and never will. Stella will always stand between me and Wolfgang. The time of childish tenderness and trust has passed. Wolfgang abhors his father and despises me for my cowardice. He will only understand me much later, when he goes from one room to the other as I do, alone with my unease and the knowledge that the prison is completely inescapable. But by then I will have ceased to be, just as my father has ceased to be, whose ironic laissez-faire attitude filled me with insecurity as a child. The eye that fell upon me when I played with my dolls is the eye with which I follow Wolfgang when he goes to play tennis with his friend, and with which he already observes his little sister’s games.

If Wolfgang were with me now, he would try to save the bird in the linden tree, and I would need to deter him, because if the mother bird doesn’t return the little one will be beyond help, it can’t eat on its own. Only its mother could save it, and I’m starting to doubt that she’s coming back. It has grown smaller than it was, I’m sure of it, even though it was already so tiny in the morning that I couldn’t imagine a smaller bird. I can see it clearly now, a little bundle of feathers opening its beak and its eyes wide with fear and hunger. Its mother isn’t going to come. I’ve closed the window again. The sun is shining on the little bird now. Maybe it will go to sleep and I’ll have a few hours of peace if I know it’s safe. All this crying is draining its strength away far too soon. Perhaps it’s thirsty, in fact it must be. But how ridiculous to be bothered by a bird. Richard would laugh at me. I just have to believe that its mother will find it. Sometimes I find myself thinking that it’s my inability to believe that attracts calamity. Perhaps Richard would never have become the person he is today if I had blindly believed him, perhaps everything would have been different if my father had not looked at us so strangely the day I brought Richard home. How could he have known, who gave him the right to know what was to come, and who gives me the right to pursue Wolfgang with my eyes just as I pursued Richard and Stella?

We need to get used to looking past people and things, we should never allow our thoughts to deceive us. It would be even better, of course, if we could stop thinking, because even our thoughts kill.

I thought: ‘He will destroy Stella.’ I thought it for long enough for it to happen in reality. I know that Richard is afraid of my thoughts. Superstitious, like everyone with an energetic constitution, he fears only what he cannot grasp and understand for himself. But he is strong enough to push that fear aside, as he pushes aside everything that would get in the way of his plans.

Why did nothing warn me on that September evening, when Stella came to us? Why didn’t I simply turn down Luise’s request? It didn’t suit me at all to take this strange young woman into our home, and even Richard wasn’t exactly thrilled with the idea. He only agreed for my sake and because Stella was only supposed to stay for ten months. Luise is my friend, that is to say she has claimed to be my friend for thirty years. I’ve never liked her, not even at school, because even as a child she was stingy, duplicitous, and hateful. Luise always wanted to have my things, in those early days she stole my erasers, patent leather belts, and sausage sandwiches, later she wanted the men who wooed me, and now at last, with the help of her daughter, she has destroyed the peace I’d struggled so hard to find. She is a bringer of misfortune, Luise, ugly, dried-up, and boy crazy. But I’ve never managed to persuade Richard that she’s just a burden to me. He simply doesn’t understand that there are some people you despise and still cannot escape. Never in his life would Richard have found himself in such a situation. He shrugs off everyone who isn’t of use to him in some way or other. Even Stella wasn’t much use to him for long; a few weeks, nothing more. She made him far too uncomfortable. What could a seducer like him do with this clumsy, earnest child? No woman has ever bored him as quickly as Stella did.

Richard had never seen her before. Luise always tended to travel without her daughter, and he had formed a quite mistaken impression of Stella. Even today I can’t believe that Stella was really Luise’s daughter, even though there can be no doubt about it. Stella’s father must have been an irresponsible fellow if he managed to spawn a child with Luise. He seems to have immediately regretted this development and tried, by drawing up a will that was as refined as it was shortsighted, to protect his child from his wife by making Luise the beneficiary of his financial assets while Stella would inherit the pharmacy. But he really shouldn’t have arranged his will like this, because as a result he created an implacable enemy for his daughter. The best thing that Luise ever did for Stella was to put the child – who was often terrified, crouched in a corner at home, becoming more and more of a hindrance – in a convent. There, Stella found so much love that she was able to store it up and live off it for eight years. Of course she really should have studied pharmacy, but that training was not what Luise had in mind – the less Stella understood of what she was supposed to understand, the better it was for Luise. But since Stella had to do something, in the end, and her mother had no use for her whatsoever alongside her women friends, dogs, and lovers, she hit upon the idea of foisting Stella off on me, at least for a year, or as long as her business studies course lasted. In quiet despair, Luise must’ve said to herself that the day of Stella’s maturity was drawing ever closer. That wouldn’t have been her downfall, of course, because she still had a legacy, and she had certainly become rich enough over the past few years, barely hampered by an old and half-demented guardian. But then again there was also the matter of this young man whom she was determined to marry, but whom, as she was probably well aware, she could only buy. It was a hopeless situation for her, I admit.

So Stella came to us, pushed aside once again by her mother, and also not eagerly awaited by us.

Our household, in fact, is set up in such a way that it cannot withstand an intruder, or even a guest. For reasons that are only too obvious. Richard’s friends will never be my friends, and Richard finds my friends uncongenial. Apart from this, no one else is familiar with the countless taboos that we must observe in our dealings with one another, and which must be respected even by the children. Consequently, our topics of conversation are somewhat restricted, but of course that’s better than ceaseless friction. Then there’s also the fact that a stranger would destroy my relationship with Wolfgang: everyone disturbed the two of us in those days, even little Annette, and of course Richard too. For that reason I didn’t take on a maid as such, but a cleaner, a morose and sulky person who has no interest in us, we are nothing more to her than the people whose floors she cleans in return for a decent wage. She simply does her work, entirely governed by ideas and worries about people that we don’t know or care to meet. People on the moon couldn’t be any stranger than we are to her. Even though it’s never mentioned, there were two sides in our house: Richard and Annette, Wolfgang and me – and we adhered strictly to the rules of the game. Richard had brief and slightly too cordial conversations with his son, to which Wolfgang responded with perfect politeness, and Annette would sometimes sit on my lap, and of course I put her to bed and she would kiss and hug me. But that isn’t entirely true. I think Wolfgang has always loved his father, even though he sees straight through him, and if there is a secret pain in Richard’s life, its name is Wolfgang. His son’s otherness must cause him suffering, if Richard allows himself to suffer, because in fact Richard is seeking a friend, and Wolfgang will never be his friend. Where little Annette is concerned, I would probably love her instinctively if she weren’t so much like her father. It isn’t her fault that the very sight of her sometimes fills me with horror. I see her blossoming little face, I feel her warmth and hear her laughter, and know that they mean just as little as Richard’s warmth and laughter. Both of them, Annette and her father, are born decoys, traps that God, or whoever, has set for other people, the heavy, loyal, imaginative, and emotional ones. Perhaps Annette is also too healthy and happy to be truly loved. This child will always achieve what she wishes for, and will never wish for anything unattainable. She is just as weak and helpless as a young tiger or a carnivorous plant. Richard is proud of this daughter, but basically he knows exactly who she is: a good-natured companion as long as he indulges all her moods.

But since he has never loved anything as much as himself, he must also love this little image of himself. Sometimes he gives Annette a mighty slap, which she takes with a quiet whimper. He has never struck Wolfgang, who is one of those children that one doesn’t strike. Richard is much too clever to show weakness and put himself in the wrong.

During her first weeks with us, Stella was a terrible bother to all of us. Richard, who loved drinking his red wine, smoking and reading in the evening, suddenly felt forced to make conversation with a girl like Stella and found it terribly tiring and utterly pointless. Annette was simply jealous, as she is of anyone who lays claim to the interest of those around her. Wolfgang felt disturbed by the change in atmosphere, and I had a sense of being too quiet and not knowing how to deal with young girls. It seemed impossible to guess Stella’s thoughts and respond to them. This tall, pretty, slightly too well-built girl was an alien element in our house, and she must certainly have felt that herself. She was more timid than shy, inhibited by her years of life in the convent, and I thought she must have seemed a little strange there too. She wasn’t at all cute, childish, and silly as young girls tend to be. In fact she looked like a woman who is only still a child by chance. And as quiet as she was, it was impossible to ignore her. The dreadful brown clothes that Luise had bought for her were unbecoming enough, but she could not simply be ignored.

I had tried to adapt the spare room in which Stella was expected to live to the needs of its young new resident, arranging a few knickknacks around the place, the kind that young girls like, and covering the dark furniture with lace doilies. Then, when I actually saw Stella, I wished I could have cleared all those odds and ends away, but by then she had already seen them, which meant that it was no longer possible. So the horses, dogs, and ballerinas stayed on the chest of drawers and looked quite strange beside this tall, earnest girl. I imagine that Stella never really studied. She sat in front of her exercise books and her textbooks and was simply bored. She was bad at maths, and probably the slowest of her class at shorthand. In fact I had no idea if she had any real talents or skills. She was good with animals and plants, she liked doing menial work, and knitted jackets and socks from coarse grey wool for some poor people or other. Then she sent those rather shapeless things to her old convent. Richard liked to tease her about her charity work. Then she would open her wide, white eyelids and laugh quietly and clumsily, like someone who has yet to learn how to laugh. She only knitted them to avoid accusations of laziness, and so that she could spend hours alone with her thoughts.

I knew nothing at all about those thoughts. Sometimes I doubted that she was thinking anything at all, her face was so still. She liked engaging with Annette, and the child finally began to return her affection. At first Wolfgang observed her with a mixture of curiosity, shyness, and prejudice. In that too every inch my son; it would never have occurred to him to approach a stranger. When it became clear to me that I would never be able to have a real relationship with Stella, I began to abandon my efforts and went back to living as I had done before, as if there were no young girl in my spare room. She still disturbed me, but I knew that the disturbance would not last for very long. I was always friendly towards Stella, just as friendly as I am with my cleaner, the mailman, or Wolfgang’s friends from school.

I started yielding to my own thoughts again, walking from one window to another, smoking or with my hands pushed into my sleeves, gazing into the now bare garden. I bought flowers, which became increasingly expensive as the cold season progressed, I dutifully went for walks with Annette, and I talked to Wolfgang about the books that he was constantly devouring, some of which were perhaps unsuitable for him. Of course I also took care of the housework, got annoyed with Annette, who was lazy and slovenly at school, and, as usual, discussed with Richard all sorts of matters relating to the children and the housekeeping. I did everything according to routine; for me reality meant staring into the garden, wandering restlessly around the house, and feeling warmth in my breast at the sight of Wolfgang.

Something had happened to me years ago that left me in a diminished state, an automaton that just gets on with its work, barely suffers, and is only turned back for seconds at a time into the living young woman that it once was. The touching curve of Wolfgang’s neck, the roses in the white vase, a draught billowing the curtains, and all of a sudden I’m aware that I’m still alive. Then there’s the other thing, which fills me with fear, with horror, with the feeling that something’s going to jump out at me at any moment and break down the invisible wall.

I know that can’t happen, but it forces its way into my mind, time after time, staring at me from the faces of strangers in the street, rising in the howl of a dog, filling my nostrils in the butcher’s shop with the stench of blood, and touching me like a cold hand at the sight of Richard’s full, cheerful face.

Something must have happened to me years ago; since then I don’t think I’ve been able to tolerate the idea that, incomprehensibly to my brain and heart, good and evil are one. To be able to endure that knowledge, one would need the vital force of a giant. But giants do not find themselves in this situation; for them, thinking is replaced by a sturdy cudgel. They prefer to live. Thinking people must always give up living, and living people do not need to think. The act of salvation is never performed, because anyone with the strength to carry it out is unaware that they must do it, and the knowing person is incapable of action

Stella was one of the living. More than a person, she was like a big grey cat or a young deciduous tree. She sat at our table, thoughtless and innocent, waiting for fate. Richard would have needed only to reach out a hand to grip her tanned wrist. He didn’t, but he smiled as he cut up the meat on his plate, calmly, relishing each movement.

Richard is a born traitor. Equipped with a body that grants him constant pleasure, he could live contentedly, were he not gifted with a dazzling intelligence. It’s this intelligence that turns the pleasures of his sensual body into crimes. Richard is a monster: a considerate paterfamilias, a valued lawyer, a passionate lover, traitor, liar, and murderer.

I have known all this for years, and if I knew who I could hold responsible for this knowledge, I would kill them. I used to see only guilt in Richard, and I began to hate him. But now I have known for a long time that he is not to blame if I react like this to the fact of his presence. There are so many others like him, the whole world plainly knows and accepts it, and no one puts him on trial. Whose fault is it that I can’t just accept things as they are? I am slowly giving up hope that someone, I don’t know who, will one day take a stand, and even if they did, I wouldn’t know how to respond. My rage went up in smoke long ago; all that remains is the horror that dominates me completely, and that I inhabit, in which I am trapped. It has entered me, it has saturated me, and it accompanies me wherever I go. There is no escape. My worst thought is that even death could not be deadly enough to extinguish it at last.

But horror and the knowledge of the truth that one is not supposed to know belong to the order of everyday life. Yes, I cling to this order, to the regular mealtimes, the work that returns every day, the visits and walks. I love that order, which allows me to live. One day I was struck by the touching equanimity with which Stella wore her clothes, those brown, claret, and purple horrors that were either too big or too small for her, and which testified to Luise’s wickedness. ‘We should buy her decent clothes,’ I said to Richard, ‘and she would be a beauty.’ He glanced up from the newspaper, gave me a surprised look and said, ‘Do you think so?’

I know his weakness for delicate, distinctive women. I went on to praise Stella’s merits. He laughed and rocked his head regretfully back and forth: buying clothes for her was none of our business. In two years, once she was in possession of the pharmacy, she would start dressing decently. ‘Luise,’ I said, ‘is a disgrace.’ Richard raised his shoulders comically, shook himself a little and laughed. Suddenly I had an idea. What if I taught Stella how to dress? I closed my eyes and saw her coming down a flight of stairs in a white dress, smiling with her lips in a Cupid’s bow, her reddish-brown hair shiny and loose, young, beautiful and seductive. I saw Richard’s white, firm hands holding the newspaper, and was filled with a kind of satisfaction that he couldn’t see this beauty, obstructed as it was by his penchant for an artificial, refined prettiness.

Over the following weeks the seamstress came to the house and sewed a few dresses for Stella, out of cheap materials, but in bright colours suitable for a young girl.

The transformation was complete. Stella stood in front of the mirror and saw herself as what she really was for the first time. ‘You’re beautiful, Stella,’ I said, straightening a crease. She didn’t look at me, and spoke seriously into the mirror, ‘I’m beautiful,’ amazed, surprised and finally overwhelmed by the new feeling that my words and her reflection had awoken in her, and then said again, ‘I’m beautiful.’

Now I could actually have triumphed. Luise, the dragon, had been outwitted. It was entirely possible that the newly transformed Stella could bring home a fiancé who would ensure that in the future Stella’s fortune would not be turned into Luise’s clothes, hats, and lovers. But strangely I was unable to rejoice in this idea. Incidentally, I have never been gratified by a triumph, it usually makes me embarrassed, or puts me in a slightly painful state of mourning. Perhaps it’s because my triumph means the defeat of someone else; I transform myself into that other person and suffer on their behalf. Luise, however, was so repulsive to me that I couldn’t summon that feeling for her. What troubled me in my joy was Stella’s face in the mirror, that gleaming face, that young, blossoming flesh, and that gaze devoted entirely to her new brilliance. I felt a creeping unease. Stella was no longer the child that she had been. There was a void in her breast, and it would draw the world towards it. And I didn’t like that. It was not within my power to guide the flow that would fill that void. ‘Stella,’ I said quickly, ‘Stella, shouldn’t you practise your shorthand today?’

She covered her eyes with her hands in a touchingly childlike gesture and turned towards me. Her arms fell to her sides, the gleam in her eyes was extinguished, and she turned towards the door with a sigh. That evening Richard hadn’t noticed that a new Stella was sitting across from him. But Annette noticed it and so did Wolfgang, who gave me a thoughtful, quizzical look.

Stella, in her strawberry-coloured dress, ate hardly anything and stared dreamily into the distance. Fully in command of her healthy young body, she absent-mindedly took little sips of her tea.

The bird is still sitting in the linden tree. It hasn’t stirred from the spot all night. It isn’t screaming any more, just cheeping faintly. If I close the window, I can’t hear it any more. It’s so tiny now that it can barely be called a bird. Its mother hasn’t come, and I don’t think she’s going to.

When I’m alone in the house I’m always aware that this isn’t my house. Sometimes I feel like a lodger here. All that belongs to me is the view of the garden, nothing else. Once I even imagined that I would at least have something I could call a home, but since Stella’s death, the gilded cage has turned into a dungeon. If I’m not mistaken, the garden has even moved further away from the house. It’s moving away from me, slowly, almost imperceptibly, one day it will disappear completely, and I will stare out of the window into the void and think, that’s where the linden tree used to be, and over there the patch of lawn with the viburnum bushes. Perhaps this has something to do with the windows. They are gradually becoming more opaque until they finally obstruct my view.
