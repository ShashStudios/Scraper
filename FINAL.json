    "text": "What was I saying. I am putting my face on for the second time this morning. My brow, my cheeks, my chin receding into the featureless landscape of the unguents. I am drawing on the eyebrows, which have largely vanished after years of preening. Hurrying this time. The sun has left the bathroom so I move, following a line of orange colouring marker on the skirting boards that dips and rises to our daughters’ old bedroom, where I bend awkwardly for a small, round mirror. I have found an eyelash on my cheek. I dab it with the end of a middle finger, holding it erect for a moment, then close my eyes, and make a wish, to please keep the aircraft in the air today. And blow as on a birthday candle.

I will have to find a new wish now, I am thinking, looking for the eyebrow pencil. Now I have retired from the airline, I could change the make-up routine. Try plum or lilac. I am looking around the dresser for the pencil I was holding a second ago, my annoyance only half drawn on as I look in the drawer of the nightstand.

Has my husband, sitting in front of the television, seen a pencil, I am asking on all fours, looking under the armchair. An eyebrow pencil, brown, about this long. What are you watching. Maybe I took it to one of the other mirrors, I am saying, letting the question trail off into the television’s applause. My husband, who retired from the welfare office a year ago but continues to dress in his office clothes and to rise at seven on weekdays, has fallen asleep in front of the game show, which means it is later than I thought.

When the face is a mess, as we say to juniors, the rest follows, things begin to slip. But a face put together feels no fear or tiredness or anger. Bright smiles hold the plane in the air, I am always saying.

I am looking around the bathroom, on the floor, on and around the sink. But unlike my husband, I do not lose my head when things disappear. I have come to accept that sometimes you are holding something and then it is gone. You are writing a list, you put the pen down and then the pen is gone. No matter how hard you look it is as if the pen had flown away. My husband says I have a talent for making his things disappear. It has become a source of despondence to my husband when I put things away and forget about them, which he says, is the same as deliberately hiding them. It is as if an entity living in our house were slowly moving things out of our reach. One day, my husband says, I will misplace him and it will be like falling through a hole in the world where at least, he says, he will be reunited with the charging cable and his reading glasses, the Blu-Tack and the good pen. But if my husband would let me finish, a while later when you are no longer thinking about pens but looking for the television remote, which has somehow fallen out of existence, it turns out you are actually holding the pen. There, in your other hand, as in a magic trick. And so there is no reason to get angry, I assure my husband, for though the remote is lost, is not the pen regained, and if something must first be lacking, is not everything found that once was lost.

I am looking around the sink in case the pencil decided to reappear when I had my back turned. And then my phone starts ringing. Our eldest daughter is calling as I search for the reading glasses without which I am always stabbing the wrong part of the phone and declining people’s phone calls. Please wait, please hold on, I am saying, as I hurry down the stairs, looking around the catchall, the pockets of my coat, letting my hand fall to my side in mock despair when the ringing stops.

I am standing for a moment in front of the game show where contestants open boxes. Whatishecalled is speaking through a red telephone to an entity who dispenses cash prizes, and because of Jenny from Manchester’s enormous gums, I have forgotten what I was looking for. Still, I am turning over the sofa cushions so that by looking I may remember what was forgotten, maybe under the sofa or somewhere around the room, my hands on my hips, so that no one will say that I wander into rooms forgetting what it was I was doing.

Everyone is praying for Joan from Middlesex who has selected the box in front of Andrew from Cardiff. The number of the box is the same as her son’s birthday and she is holding to her lips a small stuffed tiger that once belonged to him, its ears and stripes worn with fondling.

I am worming my hand under my husband in case he is sitting on whatever it was I was looking for, until finally I take my glasses off, put them on my head and drop my arms in defeat, letting go of whatever it was that was probably nothing, leaving the room with the same assurance I have learned from years of smiling into the distance, even as the oxygen masks are dangling and the duty-free is rolling along the aisles, and clings to me wherever I go, obliging and never complaining, impeccable in every detail, appearing always busy, unperturbed by strange noises and sudden drops in altitude.

As I climb the stairs, I think is it possible that I did not lose anything. As when I leave the house with the feeling that something is missing or forgotten or undone, but after checking all my pockets or turning back find that everything is where it was. Maybe you cannot remember, because no one can remember what they have not forgotten, I am thinking, putting away the suitcase from the France retirement holiday. My husband insists he will put the suitcase away, but it has just been lying on the floor of our bedroom since we got back a week ago, reminding me of this holiday he thoughtfully organised to celebrate my retirement and which I would like now to forget. The whole time he called me Madame, for he knows I love France and everything French. He said I would never pick up another suitcase as long as he lived, but I wish he was less rough with our luggage and with things in general which, he says, are not made of glass, doing a mincing impression of a French homosexual, but was in fact a retirement present from the airline and now the retractable handle is broken and you have to bend down to wheel it in front of you over the quaint but uneven cobbles of Chapeau, causing him to sweat and gasp in front of the French, who never gasp or sweat. I wish my husband would close his mouth when we are on holiday, and not stick his tongue out at the slightest effort. I wish he would stop breathing in front of women on deckchairs, in front of children in swimwear who cannot help watching the spectacle of my husband eating ice cream cones. Still, it is important to me that he performs these gestures, such as carrying the luggage, showing that he thinks of me, and that I continue to exist when I am not in the room.

Before I put the case in the attic I will use it to store the summer clothes and some things I have found in the closet, like the cushion shaped like a fish which admittedly was very funny at the time but now you do not know what to do with, and some lewd souvenirs from Chapeau which my husband thinks are extremely funny and wanted to give to people and which I put away when we came back and we have not been able to find since. I am moving some old video cassettes that we have been keeping in the girls’ bedroom to the suitcase lying on the bed.

I am sitting on the small single bed opposite the bunk beds in our daughters’ bedroom, young men with hair gel and abdominals looking on dreamily as I leaf through some old copybooks from a cardboard box that once contained an under-desk bike exerciser and now is full of all kinds of rubbish, sports-day medals, communion medals, ribbons, CDs, spare memorial cards from our daughter’s funeral, things you do not even know what they are. The orange marker that goes around the skirting boards comes into the room, loops over the window frame, runs up the bunk bed and swirls and expands under the top bunk where it begins or ends, and now leaps on to the copybook where the youngest of the three has done a crude drawing of her father which, you must admit, looks like the male member smiling at you with bird’s wings and flaming orange hair. Our eldest, it must be, has written, I am doing your hair the colour of the holy spirit in quotes and the date.

Hmm, I am thinking, wandering out on to the landing. I am like a coin that has not yet fallen on one side or the other. But then I start moving towards the bathroom, where I catch myself unfinished in the mirror. I had to put my make-up on twice this morning because I cried all over myself like a papier-mâché head left out in the rain and now I am behind on the day.

I almost never cry, never once went on strike. But this morning I called our eldest daughter, whom I am usually careful not to disturb, about something I cannot now remember. Now, as I apply the contours of the nose, heightening the cheekbones, foreshortening the top half of my massive forehead, lining the airline’s stipulated red smile, I am thinking about how I started shaking with tears this morning and had to hold on to the kitchen counter as if to stop myself from falling. I am remembering the long rope of weeping that reached almost to the floor, until by the fourth or fifth ring of the phone I suddenly fell quiet, like a baby that has cried itself out, and whatever it was fell right out of my head and I hung up before our daughter could answer. I am taking the pencil from the edge of the sink to complete the ponderous expression, thinking what it could have been that I forgot. No trace of the storm that carried my face away, only the quiet optimism which you feel on some level is all that is keeping the plane in the air.

Pulling the shopping trolley behind me on the pavement, I wish I did not have to experience the tedium of the walk to the Lidl supermarket. It is mostly pebble-dash, except for the statue of the Virgin which they have had to put behind chicken wire to stop children throwing stones at her. Once you are in the Lidl supermarket it is not too bad but then there is the return which is arguably worse, where you pass the Virgin again, missing her hands and nose, baring her terrifying wire armature, where the plaster has fallen away. Sometimes I wish the shopping could be done as in a montage. Much of life, I feel, should be as in a montage. The effort and tedium edited out, the wheelless, seatless bicycle tied to the lamp post edited out, the young men on bicycles, and the wet mattress clinging to a lamp post edited out, leaving only the nice parts, and maybe some light piano music. Surely they must be working on something like it. How is it that one minute you are on the pavement going to the Lidl supermarket sighing at the eternity of the pebble-dash and then somehow you have returned, and where does the time between the one and the other go. Does it fall out of existence, I am asking my husband as I survey the road between the curtains of the front-room window, or does it remain, not in an actual room, not in a literal room, but somewhere, I am saying, sucking my teeth at the smear on the shoulder of my blouse, where a series of beige chins accumulate. My hand falls with a despondent slap of my thigh at the stain on the fun and different pineapple blouse where I must have caught my face this morning.

I am wetting my finger on the way to the kitchen, wiping urgently at the stain which you must address as soon as possible, like mutinous junior flight staff or an unfamiliar lump. Quick, the fun and different pineapple blouse is new, its jumble of pineapples is very me. Quick, I am thinking, rubbing harder. Wiping the pineapples with some soap, I notice that my husband has pulled sheets out of the Lidl supermarket magazine and laid them in front of the wall where he has started painting over some orange marker. When my husband retired he started seeing orange marker all around the skirting boards of our house. For a second the shadow of what I was crying about opens its arms to me and I try to hold the memory by rubbing harder with the soap and sticking my tongue out a little. Our daughter died a long time ago and you feel it is okay to paint over these things now, to get new appliances even if they have orange marker on them where our dead daughter tried to colour everything in the so-called colour of the holy spirit. I am doing a sad weeping face and thinking of our dead daughter in case that was what it was this morning, but then the kettle grumbles to a boil. I do not remember putting the kettle on but it has a cup next to it with a teabag inside, which I drown in the water. Then I go back to rubbing the blouse with the soap, looking around at the floor in case the tears are there waiting to be cried again. I am trying to remember the first two notes of this memory which is like a song that will not come back or a bird that has flown back out of a window, leaving me in the hallway, thinking, where am I going, until the hot tea I am holding takes me, as though by the hand, into the front room where it is set before my husband.

Andrew who works at an Argos warehouse is weeping and has to be comforted by Jill from Northampton and Noel from Antrim, and eventually, everyone joins in to comfort him, including Joan, the woman with the stuffed toy, because of how guilty Andrew feels about the contents of the box that was randomly assigned to him. I am standing for a moment, hands on my hips, sucking my teeth and shaking my head, then turn to the door and go upstairs where I had started packing.

 

But I must have drifted off. Like when I am reading and pages later I have no idea how I got here, in this woman’s body, sitting on the lid of the toilet, under the open window, eating biscuits as the cars on the motorway rock back and forth in the rain like the sea.

The way I have drawn my eyebrows is as if I were thinking very hard about something, but actually I was gazing into space remembering the restaurant in Chapeau when he insisted on shaking the chef’s hand. He had to congratulate the chef on the food. He got angry because I would not try the mussels. Kept saying how talented the chef was, and I had to try and calm him down. People looking, waiters asking him to stay seated, a fight almost breaking out. It comes back in waves of clenching embarrassment. Then, later, watching him apologise to everyone profusely with a French accent to make them understand, tears in his eyes. My husband is always crying and saying sorry. Before leaving, I went to the bathroom, and when I came out he was doing his magic routine, his expression full of wonder, theirs polite and embarrassed, a napkin folded into a dove perched on his arm and then vanishing.

I am wearing one of the dingier bras and still almost-skin-coloured underpants that sink into rolls of fat like bread dough, thin blue veins scrambling like fireworks and petering out over bristling thighs, painted toes staring back like fat pigs from a nursery rhyme. The biscuits I am eating come from behind the plastic bath panel that my husband has still not sealed to the tub. This is where I hide the biscuits from my husband but I have no memory of pulling out the plastic bath panel or only vaguely, or it was a different time.

I was about to remember what I was doing here, but our eldest daughter is calling again and by the time the glasses are on the end of my nose and I am holding the phone, close at first, then farther away, close and far away, back and forth like this, taking aim with a red fingernail and the tip of my tongue sticking out, our daughter has hung up.

Hmm, I am thinking, trying to match the puzzled expression of the eyebrows with a pursing of the mouth, what is the kettle doing on the floor.

Suddenly, I am remembering to lock the door in case my husband comes in, asking why am I sitting naked on the toilet, eating biscuits and so on in the middle of the afternoon.

But the door is already locked.

My husband and I never lock the door though, I am thinking, eating another biscuit, thinking what was I doing in the upstairs bathroom.

Suddenly my irises widen. My heart flutters. But it turns out to be nothing and I sit back down again, shaking my head at myself and this stupid idea I just had.

Back on the toilet seat, I notice the orange marker again, this time in the grouting. Our four-year-old’s most concerted effort with the marker took place behind the television which we moved to cover it up. This meant adjusting the sofa which we forgot had been covering up another spot that she had been trying to fill in with the holy spirit, but which, it turned out, was roughly the shape of the CD rack, and then when CDs were no longer a thing, became a cheese plant.

I am listening to the vascular throb of the television downstairs, wondering what my husband is watching. Soon it will be time for my programme, and then I realise, with sudden brutal clarity, why it was I came up here. I slap myself on the forehead but when I stand up and examine this new realisation, it turns out to be the first realisation, in all its abject stupidity, for the second time.

Soon it will be time for my favourite programme about a depressed English detective. It is getting cold and dark and quiet in the bathroom and I wish I would stop eating the biscuits which are beginning to turn my stomach. I know it was a stupid idea, but still, I cannot help feeling hopeful about this idea I once considered extremely stupid. I am standing at the mirror, taking the hairbrush from the edge of the sink, and brushing my hair. I am brushing my hair in case that was why I came up here but how, I am thinking, can the brushing account for the kettle or the nudity or the lock on the door or the biscuits. Still, I continue to brush my hair in case it takes a while to take effect.

Our eldest daughter is calling but I just remembered why I locked myself in. You become so accustomed to the shouting and crying and recriminations in this house that it becomes a kind of routine in the middle of which you drift off listening to the hush of the motorway or thinking of Chapeau. Some things you do so many times, I always tell my juniors, you can forget you are doing them. I could work through an entire flight, thinking about something else, or perform the safety demonstration, sometimes thinking nothing at all, and have almost no memory of the flight taking place, or the memory of that flight would be the memory of some earlier flight. So now, I cannot remember the precise details of this argument with my husband, but which has all the signs of many previous arguments and is the only way to explain the lock on the door, which he could easily break through but is held back from for fear of damaging the frame. And though I cannot remember all the particulars of this argument, the whole situation is very distressing, which is why I console myself with the biscuits and keep boiling water to throw on my husband should he attempt to tear through the door’s flimsy locking mechanism.

That is why I cannot answer my phone. There is a lot our eldest daughter does not know about her father that her mother keeps behind closed doors. Soon my husband will come out of the front room and call my name from the bottom of the stairs. I will refuse to come out of the bathroom, and may well have to leave my husband for good this time. After a minute or so he will lose patience and go back to the television. Then he will rise from the sofa with something that has occurred to him, stirring things up again, and so on, until, at the end of a long silence, the stairs will ache under my husband’s weight. I will refuse to open the door and will not believe any of my husband’s words which are empty. What has pushed me to the edge this time and so many times is how routine the whole thing has become. The routine has changed and adapted in minor ways just as the in-flight safety demonstration changes and adapts, but always it is the same argument in essence, just as the planes are always largely the same. My voice then will crack with weeping, screaming at him to not come any closer and so on, I have boiling water and so forth. I cannot do it any more, for the last time I cannot do it.

It will not be long now, I am thinking, following the television for the time. My husband will let himself slide to the foot of the door, whispering there, as if our daughters were still here to listen. Who are you whispering for, I sometimes shout angrily. One minute my husband is shouting, the next minute he is whispering. But for whom, I ask, screaming. Then after a long silence it will be his turn to start crying, saying over and over again how sorry he is. My husband never used to cry when the children were around. Not until they were gone did he start crying, wearing you down until you drift off and eventually have no choice but to let him in.

It will not be long now, I am thinking. Because I am in love with France and everything French, my husband always made crêpes for our daughters after our fights, sometimes bringing a plate under the stairs where the two youngest would hide from the screaming. After the girls were gone, it was the only way we knew to bring things to a close and I am always careful to have ingredients, in case of an argument, always the same or more or less the same argument, usually on a Sunday, the only chance work ever afforded. I am not looking forward to the screaming, which is always exhausting, yet even now I cannot help smiling at the thought of the crêpes and the mystery of a dead body showing up next to a lake in Devon or somewhere. Eventually, I will unlock the door and sit back on the floor, eyes turned away from my husband, who, after a pause, will slide over to me, rest his head in my lap and cry as we listen to the lullaby of the motorway. I will stroke his hair until he goes quiet and later give him the rest of the biscuits, usually two-thirds to three-quarters, letting what is said pass into silence.

My husband thinks I will not notice that there are fewer biscuits behind the bath panel. He thinks I will not miss one or two, sometimes three or even four biscuits, which he sneaks out of the bathroom. He thinks I do not know he has found the hiding place, but I have always known. Imagine, I am thinking, how rapidly our marriage would have dissolved without the biscuits and ingredients for the crêpes, and if I let my husband do the shopping, what surreal assortment my husband would come home with if he was allowed to go to the supermarket. It is pointless sulking if there are fewer biscuits than usual. He should have taken less time to make things up to me, and in the first place, he should not be eating biscuits. I am shaking my head at my husband who thinks that by going unnamed, by remaining unspoken, the biscuits will not affect his diabetes. It is because of the diabetes that I must hide the biscuits, which, officially, are reserved for me, and are meant to be a secret, and, therefore, do not, strictly speaking, exist.

Pff, I am thinking, in the soft pink dusk of the bathroom, the water in the kettle could not burn anyone any more. What is going on in the mind of my husband. He does not call my name so I can shout back at him to leave me alone, to not come in here, and so on. I am worrying now about what he will say about all the biscuits I have eaten, even though he is the one who should have come to the door sooner, broken down in tears so we could move on. But instead I must eat my husband’s biscuits which I do not even enjoy.

My phone lights the bathroom like a tea light in a church and goes dark again. A smile is forming on my lips even as I am sucking my teeth, for though it is always the same excuses, the same promises and twisting of words, I am looking forward to leaving the bathroom. But then it turns out to just be our daughter and my heart falls out of the sky.

Is it possible he is acting as if nothing happened, as if I had just been attending to the ordinary concerns of the bathroom, brushing the toilet bowl, changing the dried flowers in the ornamental dish, watching the television as if he had no idea of an argument, what do you mean, love, what did I do, what the hell are you talking about.

I am screaming. Usually, I would also be crying, but it is hard to get the tears going when you do not remember what caused them. The vein in the side of my head is swelling and throbbing, though I am held back by a kind of self-awareness and my heart is not really in it. The room itself swells and throbs with shouting, until there is no air left in my lungs, only a faint fading ring as the bathroom falls quiet again.

My husband knows it is Sunday and that my programme will be on soon yet he will not take responsibility. He does not care that I am in the bathroom screaming and, as far as he knows, also weeping. My husband, with whom I only stayed because of the children, is finally driving me to leave him forever. Now that our children have gone, each in their separate ways, finally, it is time to think about myself. Finally, I will pack a suitcase and I will leave forever, I have decided. It is the only way to put down the biscuits and get out of the bathroom, to get as far away as I can from my husband.

I am making sure to leave everything as it was before I came in, closing the window, pushing the plastic bath panel back into the tub with all of the weight of the years. The weight of the years makes a lot of noise scraping the floor tiles and I have to kick it into place a couple of times. Though in some ways it is true that I have not been crying, I wipe the make-up away from my face with the backs of my hands. I am emptying the kettle into the toilet and washing my face in the sink, rubbing it until it is red and swollen and ugly. Sighing for courage, I take a square of paper, drop it in the toilet and press the bigger of the two flushes.

I am standing, broken, in the doorway of our bedroom, for the last time. After forty years of trying, I am finally leaving my husband once and for all, just as our eldest daughter always said I should have but which I could not for one reason or another. Sometimes I think our daughter failed to leave her husband because of my failure to leave mine. The suitcase is waiting on the bed, where I started packing earlier but was probably stopped by my husband. Probably it is getting a bit cold for the dresses and flip-flops, I am thinking, I do not know what use I will have for a cushion shaped like a fish that beats its tail when there are batteries. Maybe to raise my spirits on dark days, I remember. That is why I have taken the children’s old copybooks. The dresses, the fun and different pineapple blouse, and my passion for France, express who I am deep, deep down, far, far in.

I am slowly descending the stairs with the kettle and the suitcase and all of the years living with my husband. My steps are heavy and I am holding the bannisters as if weak with the years and the weeping. For though I am broken, I have not forgotten what my husband has done which at present I cannot quite remember. I am looking between the hinges of the sitting-room door, where I can see him pretending to sleep. I should have held my breath on tiptoe, I am thinking. Then I would have caught him watching, smiling at the television and moving back into position the way children do when you come back in the room. But I gave him too much warning, and now I will have to leave my husband for good this time.

My phone is ringing but I will be speaking to our daughter later when I need to find a place to stay. It will only be a couple of nights. I do not want to trouble our daughter, whose house is cold and dimly lit, you always feel you are in her way, and by then things will have sorted themselves out with my husband, who is not nearly as bad as our daughter likes to paint him.

But what was I saying. I am taking flour from the cupboard and eggs and milk from the fridge. I cannot remember when I first started taking boiling water upstairs, I am thinking, looking up at the time. Probably it dates back to when I did not know my husband as well as I know him today, like a safety protocol you have to point out for legal reasons but which no one really takes seriously any more. I am sifting the flour for my husband, making a little well at the bottom of the mixing bowl, to save us both some time. Pff, I am thinking, probably our daughter will take it as another reason to blame everything on her father. You cannot tell your daughter anything about her father without her telling you to leave your husband who has worked hard and has earned a break from her constant relitigation of the past. Our eldest daughter has an opinion on everything and uses these so-called thoughts as ways to not think about her own failures, her own husbands and children. I am heating the pan, looking up at the time. Children have their own individual characters, which you cannot set at the feet of their parents. Our daughter will see that eventually some of her children will move to Florida, some will die, while others will always be crying and complaining and relitigating. There is nothing you can do about these things, I want to tell our daughter.

I have made my husband’s crêpes and we are watching my programme about English people winding up dead in enviable homes. There is lots of exposed stone and wisteria in this one and the investigator is particularly ambivalent about his job. His house, you can tell from his clothes and manner, is not as nice as the deceased’s.

Every so often I tap my husband, asking is that not Whatishecalled, who plays the Youknowwhat, I am whispering behind the screen of my hand, in Thesomething, which my husband always confuses with Theotherone.

I am withdrawing my hand from my husband, who pretends to be asleep because of something I must have said in the past which I cannot remember but which in its context was probably justified, and so I move to the other armrest. Maybe I will remind my husband that he snores but we are no longer speaking. At least now you can follow what is going on without a running commentary from my husband, even if what is going on is not as good as you remember.

I am drawing the curtains of the front room. I am taking my plate to the kitchen where I accidentally break wind, which I worry will make me sound cheerful instead of angry for the things my husband has said, which were far worse than anything I said. I am standing for a moment in the doorway, watching my husband in case I catch him smiling or taking a biscuit. He is not moving now but you can tell he was just a moment before, like junior flight staff going quiet when senior flight staff enter a room. Please turn the television off at the wall when you come to bed, I am asking politely.

I was going to unpack the suitcase after the crêpes, but now I will have to leave it in front of the bedroom so I am ready to leave him first thing in the morning. It is too late to leave my husband today and I have not spoken to our daughter about arrangements yet.

I am turning on to my side, away from his half of the bed, as close as I can to my edge without falling off, and letting one out. I have rolled myself in the duvet so he will not have any. I do not want him to touch me. I am closing my eyes, floating on tides of murmured television washing back and forth through the door, wondering in the warm vascular darkness what must I have said for him not to speak to me. I do not want to stay at our daughter’s house, whose dog’s name and gender you are always supposedly getting wrong. Admittedly, it is not unusual for one of us to take it this far, though packing a suitcase is usually enough to end it. Once I took it a step further and, after packing my bag, said goodbye to the children, lying that I had to go back to work, and the two youngest wept and hung on to my ankles and I parked on the other side of the block for a few hours, eating chocolate from an expired advent calendar. I did the shopping and, after a probationary silence, he made crêpes and the two youngest came out of their hiding places. The four-year-old wet with tears and my husband making the dove disappear.

And when I open my eyes, the sun is wincing in the curtains. My husband is up. His pillow cold to the touch, his half of the mattress empty, and the television already on. I am hoping he will not try to talk to me. He forgets that mornings are like jet lag for me, and then he complains that he told me something and that I forgot, even though I told him. I told him I am not there in the mornings.

I am dead weight. I lower myself down the stairs, one step at a time, shuffle to and fro in the kitchen until the water has boiled and lean against the counter, zoning out at a nest of orange marker I am noticing on the refrigerator, unspooling itself around the skirting boards and on to the dial of the washing machine. Since retiring I have started noticing things, primarily in the mornings, like the three freckles on the back of my husband’s ear which I swear were not there before. We had to move the fridge around to hide our four-year-old’s attempt to fill in this blank that resides in things. I am going to pour hot water from the kettle into a mug but I am already holding a mug, hot and beige and burning my lips.

I am putting my make-up on though I thought I remembered doing it already. I am putting the clothes from the suitcase back into the dresser, reminding myself to find something with which to take them to the attic, leaving the suitcase next to the bed for my husband to put away. I am not sure what I was doing in the front room but there is always something you can be getting on with while you remember so I am dusting the picture frames on the mantelpiece and around the retirement card which reads Bonne Voyage. I cannot help smiling at this as I dust, and at the kind words of my former colleagues, who I thought did not like me but perhaps just thought I was being French. People at work somehow got it in their heads that I liked France, and would use French phrases with me. I have no idea where they got this or who they could have mistaken me for. Friends and relatives also started working under this assumption, I remember, burning my lips, gazing out the front-room window. And eventually, my husband followed. I was always missing Christmas but I would come home to a lot of French-themed gifts and it seemed impolite to say anything, and eventually, it became a part of who I am, like the fun and different pineapple blouse, which it is true has something French about it. Sometimes I think I have gotten tired of France, tired of all the French-themed decor in our home, but actually it is that I never liked France. It is easy to forget that I have never cared much for the French.

What are you watching, I am asking my husband, who has fallen asleep in front of the antiques programme. Is it the antiques you are watching.

I am thinking we should get a new refrigerator, I am telling my husband, the old one works but probably it is time to get rid of it now.

My husband is wearing black leather shoes, a blue chequered short-sleeved shirt, grey flannel trousers open at the fly that bunch three centimetres down from the belt buckle. His head is cocked back, his mouth open, showing its glistening pinks, off-whites and reds. His tie is open and some of the buttons of his shirt have popped off showing some of his chest. One of your shoelaces is loose, I am saying, sucking my teeth, except that there is a knot where you can see he lost his patience and started pulling like a maniac. I am kneeling by my husband’s shoe, trying to undo the knot but it is no use. I feel like crying at this knot in my husband’s shoelace.

I am turning off the television. I am putting the television remote in my husband’s shirt pocket as a joke about me always disappearing the television remote. I am caressing his thin, white hair and putting a throw over his knees, tucking him in, kissing him on the head.

I am standing, thinking what I will do next. I am opening the window to let the stale air out. Our daughter is calling but I cannot answer, unfortunately, due to the hoover, which is almost completely drowning out the ringing. I am not as careful with the hoover attachment around my husband’s feet as I am around the furniture. Sorry, I am saying to my husband when it hits his foot. And again a second time.

I am catching my face in the glass of the picture frames. I have not done a great job of the eyebrows today, I am thinking, which look startled as if by something coming this way. I cannot always explain the placement of my eyebrows from one day to the next.

I am looking out at the road from the front window. I dreamed, I am telling my husband, I was flying, but the controls were written in French. Anyway, I am saying, flinching at the tea, though it is basically cold, flinching as I suck it in, as if it was burning hot, and scowl at the road from the heat of the tea. A sudden downpour of children’s voices, screaming, school shoes smacking the pavement, a flash of coats and school bags, and the dead silence they leave behind them, like litter.

I am crouching under the window of the sitting room to avoid detection by our eldest daughter. Now and then you can hear the flimsy, metallic letter flap clearing its throat, her voice alternating with her daughter’s and her husband’s, Whatishecalled. No, not Whatishecalled, that is what we called the first one. Thenewone. Eventually, a key starts turning in the lock.

Our daughter is giving me a hug, then our granddaughter, whose name I am supposedly always getting confused with my youngest daughter, and I smile affably at Thenewone who says Bonjour. Our daughter is asking me something but I hold a finger to my lips, gesturing to our granddaughter that my husband is sleeping in the front room. Our daughter is asking how I am and I take the coats. She tried calling a few times but I have to strain to hear what she is saying, cupping my ear, and she is speaking so low that I simply agree, smiling at Whatishecalled, Thenewone, who is quite handsome and likes to say things in French to me. France is my thing. I am winking at him and make a drinking-tea-from-a-cup gesture while orienting us to the kitchen.

I am explaining to Thenewone about the parking disc as the tea brews, and to be careful of his tyres. Watch your tyres do not get stabbed, I am telling him, with a stabbing motion. Our daughter says I called her yesterday morning and she was worried because I was not answering the phone, but I do not have any parking discs, I am sorry to tell our daughter’s husband whom I am careful not to name in case I confuse him with the first husband, Whatwashecalled. I am offering him one of the biscuits my husband did not finish last night. I am showing our granddaughter the card I got from work. Not everyone makes it to the end, I am telling her. One colleague, years back, I am saying, laughing, after years in the company started panicking during the safety demonstration that there was nothing under our feet, and began struggling to breathe, shaking with tears and holding on to a bit of panelling as if she might fall. Haha, I am saying. She was never able to fly after that, I am laughing. Not once did I go on strike, I am telling our granddaughter. My girls always hit their targets. Where is our daughter, I am asking Thenewone, getting our daughter’s name confused with our other daughters and then my sister and my mother until finally, I get the right one. Please, I am telling him, with a hand on his arm, do not leave valuables visible in the car. I am winking and smiling at him, nodding at something he is saying, and start pouring milk, remembering how once when I came home from work our four-year-old managed to kill herself with a Lidl shopping bag. This was especially depressing as people did not really go to Lidl at the time. People forget that it was embarrassing to be seen at Lidl, to have German-labelled gherkins or biscuits, as this meant you were poor and shopped from bins, as we used to say. Their biscuits are very good though. My husband, who you know, I am saying to Thenewone, had to break down the door of the bathroom and when he got in the room was empty, as if the four-year-old had flown away. There and then not there, created and uncreated. Actually she was at the foot of the house outside, I am saying, shaking my head disapprovingly. The bag was tied to a string, I am saying, tied under her armpits in a sort of parachute. Now it is perfectly acceptable to shop in Lidl. Everyone does. I am trying to think of something else to say to our daughter’s husband in the front room where his wife is having some kind of meltdown. Still, I am saying, I find the bags a bit depressing so I usually bring a shopping trolley.

 

For a second I was worried I had forgotten the purse I usually take for the shopping, its weight missing from my left coat pocket, but actually this is normal as I am standing next to a coffin laid on a pair of trestles in an alley of the cemetery, with our daughter, and Thenewone and their daughter and others. I am beginning to notice a certain pattern with our children. Though we have three daughters, it is always the same daughter I have the least to say to who is always calling or linking arms with me, looking mournfully at me, or rubbing my back. Our daughter in Florida is sorry she could not make it, because of the dogs, which you have to say is fair enough, but sent a wreath. How true to life that the daughter I have the most in common with, the one I have the most to say to and would welcome a phone call from at any time, is the one who jumped out the bathroom window. And the daughter I have the second most in common with, who feels like an old friend you have drifted away from but still welcome a catch up with from time to time, at least is not dead, but still is very far away, has children who sound American, and almost never calls. And that finally, the daughter I have nothing to say to, the one who has nothing but the most trivial, empty things to say because she never travels and just stays on her estate, a couple of estates from here where they have exactly the same things happening, is, contrary to the first two, always calling me, and calling round to our house, and at the most inopportune times, when I am holding more things than I have hands or when I am trying to remember something perching its weightless anxious body on my shoulder and that the slightest movement will scare away. She scares it away.

The man in charge of the ceremony is wearing a black suit and white shirt and asks if anyone would like to say a word. He makes you feel awkward, this man, that you did not dress better for the occasion, or are not sad enough and do not have poignant words to say. At least he is not a priest, I am thinking. You have to say, looking at this man, that the country has come far. There is some awkward looking around at our feet, some holding of breath, clenching of jaws. A cousin of my husband is about to say something but closes his mouth again when the man moves on to the next bit. I want to laugh at my husband’s cousin, who as soon as he opens his mouth someone else is talking over him. The officiant is unfolding a sheet of paper from his trouser pocket and begins to read a poem. You have to wonder what else is in that pocket and what else that hand was holding today. A bus lurches past and I am wondering what number. I am standing the way people do, waiting for their luggage to come around. Our daughter keeps sniffling. I wish she would blow her nose but I do not want her to start relitigating the past.

Finally, the young men who were hanging around in a corner somewhere hurry solemn expressions back on to their faces and mount the coffin on to their shoulders. They too make you feel underdressed. There is a moment where the coffin looks like it might slip but coffins never slip. One of them has a stud in his ear. He is probably thinking about sex, I am thinking. My husband’s cousin tries to rub my back but my daughter gets there first and he has to make it look natural as we look into the carpeted rectangle in the earth. Then, all of a sudden, I feel light with panic, as if I was falling or made of paper. I am digging around my pocket for the keys to the house, which are in the left pocket where I keep them. Then I think that I have lost my phone but it is in the right pocket. Our daughter, who is crying, is looking at me as if to ask what is it, and I am thinking that I have lost it, lost it forever, but then I remember that I am holding it, the umbrella, and wave her away.

    "text": "Betty 

    I walked past, not young, old elm trees that should have dignity.
    
    That was one little flash of something that nearly meant something to me.
    
    I was off to see Betty, but our ten o’clock plan was not realized.
    
    I am very ashamed of myself for how long I have waited for Betty, considering that such waiting can result in confused thinking and irritability.
    
    ‘She’ll be down,’ I was told. ‘Do you want anything to drink?’
    
    It tasted so good. The coffee I was served might as well have been cocoa.
    
    Once, weeks previously, Betty had spoken to me from her stair landing. It was as if she were presenting an important address from a balcony! – with her hands gripping the banister, and that may have helped me.
    
    I want an outlook on life, a plan for my life. I want to feel like an excited dog.
    
    I heard today what sounded like a dog’s tail being stepped on, coming from her kitchen, while waiting – also, the doorbell – and two boys dropped off a plate of cookies for Betty, iced with slapdashed-thick-white frosting.
    
    And I said, ‘She won’t like those.’
    
    The boys were dressed identically, but one’s face was happy and the other’s sad. I could say one face was ecstatic. I could say nothing.
    
    But I say this in closing – today I waited for Betty for over an hour and a half, or two hours, and was not sent away.
    
    A very little bit of Betty goes a long way, not unlike how the limbs of the ancient elms kink and then reach.
    
    As I left her premises, there were so many birds flying at such speeds. Gulls.
    
    Some were bumping into each other. They were overreacting to the wind – or just impulsively motivated or were they displaying agitation about a new project? – the sort of zeal I am always in need of.
    
    Or were they showing appetite for one another – I am going to getch choo! I’m going to getch choo!
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
    Oh, to Be Able to Inspire Sex Love
    
    I was laughing the orgy off later. I had been curious enough. I was not then who I am now.
    
    Maybe I went with somebody I knew, not very well – Lisa.
    
    Hopefulness combined with bravery had gotten me to that place – a whole history could be written.
    
    Two jumbo, gatekeeper-type porcelain lions stood at the entry when we arrived. Their legs, tails, paws and faces were painted blue. Their blue tails were curled over their backs.
    
    There was a problem with the clothing – it was in a heap somewhere – my clothing, along with my money, and I knew I could not get at it when the lights went out.
    
    I felt breath on the top of my head as someone dislodged himself, as people left the front room to find bedrooms.
    
    I had not been invited and the only thing for me was this carpet, so I pulled it up – an edge – and it was dusty, and I was sweeping with my hand to get pieces of things out that were further in, and then I crawled under and fell asleep.
    
    In that era, when I was a traveler, I found environments not very different from my own, where large numbers of people participate in festivals in the richest nation of the world; exclusive groups.
    
    Please honor us with your presence – christenings, communions, weddings and surprise parties.
    
    I still follow the trails of my friends – locating their camps and their ceremonies – first saying thanks to my father and to my mother for this day, before I go out most prayerfully, seductively.
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
    Fully Forward and Down 
    
    I got in behind him on the kitchen chair – as if we could share a ride on a motorbike – not nearly enough room.
    
    That’s Gideon. Silent and somber. My arms were around his front.
    
    Back into my own proper place quickly – to take a drink of water. I aimed my full glass at and above my open mouth – and then poured, as if I had mistaken my glass for a pitcher. Not on purpose . . .
    
    I had to mop myself.
    
    After that I went out onto our porticoed porch and down the few stairs – where a stargazer I had planted appeared to notice me.
    
    The bend in the road I followed led to the house with shutters that are commonplace, as are the clapboards and one wraparound veranda.
    
    I try but cannot describe such sights in a particular way – the old-style houses that should brace and inform me, if they only would!
    
    In the evening, does it matter when? – I was so often doing this – I was rubbing a dinner serving bowl with a soapy brush and conducting the marital conversation: Na-ah. Ah. It’s all right, and I don’t know – said three times.
    
    I grew up in an old stone house with a walled garden to the rear. I often climbed the wall, and that was never easy, and I sat on it.
    
    There was not much more I could do with the wall.
    
    I did kick at it with my heels, the memorable chance to feel cruel, to hurt myself too.
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
     
    
    Me, Breathing Hard
    
    Afterward, the man, who appeared confident, was looking and looking, but not at me – the man who added a flurry to the mix of the objects all around us, out of which his head and face seemed to pop.
    
    I had a stomachache, but had consented to intercourse, because I did jump at every chance – with him.
    
    But none of this is controversial – nor had been the man’s modest request.
    
    Then I was downstairs at the point of leaving Hank Hardy forever, because he had decreed it.
    
    It is worth noting that at that time I had the same teakettle that Hank had (not on purpose). Not on purpose – I owned the very same carpet that Hank had – small enough to be used in any part of the house! The background was gold.
    
     
    
    *
    
     
    
    So even after decades have passed, I find that I thoroughly ache for Hank, and I would love to see Hank’s face as he now appears with old age creeping in on him.
    
    What I look like now . . . heavy eyelids dominate my face and I am as near as may be to slightly rotund.
    
     
    
    *
    
     
    
    Out on an errand, I walked close enough to an elderly couple to overhear the woman say, ‘What can I do with them?’
    
    ‘Do all you can do,’ the man replied, ‘if it’s not too much trouble.’
    
    The woman slumped against the traffic-light post, holding on to it tightly.
    
    When the light turned green, the man continued on without her, so I offered her my arm, as she was still latched to the post. She is frail.
    
    I might as well say this was Ann Lenihan and her husband. They’re my neighbors.
    
    And while we both dealt with the difficulty that the uphill sidewalk presented, a hulk of a woman swung by us.
    
    A toddler, seeming to be on his own – was many paces behind this person I took to be the child’s mother.
    
    He was hauling a backpack that caused him to hunch like an old man, although he’d been outfitted like a teen with shades on, with a visored cap. A sort of beast of burden, or a beast of a burden likely.
    
     
    
    *
    
     
    
    Today I managed to waylay a robin by whistling in a manner that a robin might take to be bona fide – because I was careful to repeat the phrase with no alteration.
    
    I sounded a bright note up, a bright note down, and followed those with a rolling sound – over and over again. How many times do you kiss? – pet somebody? – fuck . . .
    
    The bird chirruped and remained rooted to the ground – did not tire of me, because I had successfully wooed him.
    
    Then I flagged, I quit, I left – all of which counts, suffice it to say, for something."

    "text": "Hunter was hot but she made me feel stupid.

    It was my fault, not hers. She was patient with me. We’d been dating for three months and the stupid feeling still hadn’t gone away, not even when we kissed, not even when she looked at me under a streetlamp and said with her hands on my hips, You’re an angel from God. I didn’t know what to say so I just looked at her, her skin tinged green by a nearby exit sign. We stood there, weirdly quiet, until she touched me on the forehead and murmured, Knock knock, and I said, automatic, Who’s there?
    
    I felt stupid when she told me she’d started working at a massage parlor and without thinking I said, How come you never practice on me? We were drinking at a tiki bar and her group of friends burst out laughing, then covered their mouths.
    
    Being around Hunter’s friends only made me feel stupider. Their lives seemed so robust, urbane, full of rotating love affairs and semi-legal gig work. When they spoke, it was like they were handing out business cards – this is me, here are the things that I’m good at, that get me hot, that piss me off. They chain-smoked but had perfect skin or else the wrinkles suited them, made them look cowboy-esque. They were never home and yet their apartments were full of tropical plants that flourished in their absence. They wore complicated rompers to the gym and dirty T-shirts to parties. I suppose they were nice to me, in their own way. They recommended things for me to try – the soup dumplings from that place on Clement, EMDR, bangs.
    
    It didn’t help that Hunter had told them I’d never dated a woman before. As a group their understanding made me squirm, their soft-focus waterproof eyes. I didn’t know how to explain myself. I practiced, sometimes, in the bathroom mirror: I don’t like labels, I’m from bumfuck Nevada, I’ve never had a boyfriend either . . . but everything reeked of cliché so I just said nothing, mute in my seat, while Hunter and her friends spoke about movies that I’d never seen and who was fucking who.
    
     
    
    When I asked Hunter to explain, her voice was serene. Surely you’ve heard of a happy ending massage? She was eating leftover noodles, standing in her bedroom with one sock on, the other foot bare. Nothing seemed to make her shy; she never doubted the world’s ability to accommodate her and her shapeshifting desires. I was just another casualty to her old-world bravado, to the way she wore her jacket over her shoulders with her long arms bare, to the way she called everyone baby. She had a way of making you feel chosen when she touched you on the inner wrist, like some porno nurse taking your pulse – there, there. Her friend Ducky once told her, If you hadn’t turned out gay as fuck, you would totally be evil, to which they both cackled. Kept afloat by a trust fund, she was always into something new: noise music, numerology, performance art. There was the winter of mime, the self-imposed stick-and-pokes zigzagging her thigh. She spent hours every day in her studio, from which I was barred. That month, a blue June, her thing was collage. The floor of her apartment was covered in thrashed fashion magazines and bottles of Elmer’s glue I liked to sniff when she wasn’t around; the back-to-school smell made me nostalgic.
    
    Of course, I said. You mean those skeezy places where dudes go to get off ? I sat on her bed and picked up a magazine, a weather-beaten Vogue; as I pretended to study it, I saw that each page had a woman-shaped hole in it. This made me uneasy, like I was a rookie detective in a cop show and I’d found something damning.
    
    Sure, Hunter said. That’s the gist of it. Genevieve told me about this place downtown, Angel Palace Spa, they’ll hire anyone with tits. I’ve been craving more structure in my life, as you know, so I picked up some daytime shifts.
    
    And you like it?
    
    She smiled, cilantro in her teeth. I do.
    
    What else was there to say? She wound her arms around my neck. There was chili oil under her nails and it made my eyes sting. We took off our clothes and slid into bed, a California king she’d pushed up against the window so that I sometimes dreamed of suicide. She had a squishy white duvet I associated with privilege, as if coziness was something, like table manners or French, she’d been taught as a child by some lanky au pair. Meanwhile I rented a room in the Sunset from two dental students who dabbled in kink; on weekends they hosted sex parties and their friends would arrive in cop uniforms while they themselves wore their actual dental scrubs. Sometimes I heard a drill from behind their closed bedroom door. More perversely, they boiled three dozen eggs every Sunday night without fail. For this reason Hunter and I spent most nights at her apartment in Russian Hill, having sex on her oh-so-breathable sheets.
    
    As we lay down, I could sense that we would never talk about this again. It would be neatly off-limits, like how her family made money (they were tied up in oil and guns) or the fact that she liked me for being a little bit broken. The last thing I could think to ask was, What days do you work?
    
    Tuesdays, ten to three, she said, her voice thick with sleep. Like every mega-babe I’d ever known, she slept with a stuffed animal, in her case a gnarled hippo named Boom Boom. They said I have the makings of a top earner.
    
    I scratched her scalp the way she liked. She had recently shaved her head and we were still finding shreds of hair everywhere. With her golden curls and puffy lips, she’d looked the part of an angel; now, freshly buzzed, she was angular, troubling. She got even more attention from men in the street. Oh, I whispered. Good for you.
    
     
    
    Four days later she was leaving. Her college roommate Zero was getting top surgery and would be convalescing in his family’s Nantucket beach house; Hunter had volunteered to fly out, drain his tubes, wrangle the Roku, and reminisce on the past.
    
    He won’t be able to lift his arms or walk the dogs, she explained, throwing clothes in a duffel bag. He needs me right now. I wondered why she was packing bikinis if the plan was to putter around a dank, smelly room. I tried to picture Zero: muscular forearms, a wide-ranging knowledge of queer literature. I fought the urge to ask if they’d fucked. I didn’t want to hear her airy proclamation, Of course! But that was, like, a million years ago. Who even were we? Instead I said, I’ll miss you.
    
    She pulled me in for a kiss; her lips tasted of Emergen-C. I’ll miss you too, Laney. Really, I will. She put Boom Boom in her bag. Will you hold down the fort while I’m gone? Water my plants, stay out of trouble?
    
    I nodded, trying not to laugh; what trouble was there without her? I’d been in San Francisco for all of four months. Before Hunter and I matched on a dating app, I’d spent my nights alone. I lay in the bath and read my textbooks front to back, until my fingers went pruney and the dental students banged on the door. Some of us need TO GO #2! I’d moved to California to finish my degree, but really, the desert no longer suited me. In college I studied engineering but I stopped going the spring semester of my junior year. I floated around for a while, then found work as a receptionist at a Reno hotel called The Nugget. I liked the thirty-minute drive into Reno, when the desert was still purple, hushed; I liked the little black dresses they made us wear, bland enough to fit anyone’s fantasy.
    
    It was there that I first kissed a girl, in a double room full of cigarette smoke, while her boyfriend sat on the opposite bed and filmed us with his phone. That was the rule: he had to stay on his bed, us on ours. I remember how the cheap green bedspread crumpled under my ass, how the girl spilled her Tecate on the bed and it just slid right off, like an oil slick. I’d first seen the couple by the pool on my lunch break; the next evening, they came looking for me at the front desk. The woman wore a snakeskin bikini both times, giving me the impression that she never took it off. You might call this my wild era, a smeary year of sleeping with people I met at The Nugget. I marked the third anniversary of my sister’s death by fucking a traveling salesman who specialized in robotic vacuums. It’s the future, he promised, the future is here. Every day after work I changed into the clothes I kept in the trunk of my car and permitted myself one martini at the hotel bar. If someone fuckable didn’t materialize by the time I finished my drink, I went home.
    
    I never told Hunter about this. My encounters felt seedy compared to her tangled summer romances, her exacting terminology – polycule, edge play, stone. Her love life was a novel while mine was a pamphlet handed out by Jesus freaks (repent!!). Sometimes Hunter’s preoccupation with love made her seem worldly and sometimes it made her seem babyish, a little girl looking around her birthday party and wondering, who will pick me up next? She didn’t know who she was if she wasn’t in love, like the boys in my engineering classes who wept when they got a B+ or the veterans at The Nugget who guarded their favorite slot machines – we each sought something God-shaped to define us. I thought of the career-assessment tests I’d taken as a senior in high school, administered by a woman in butt-toning sneakers. The tests were supposed to lay bare our passions and aptitudes. My results were inconclusive; I’d gotten stoned during lunch and decided to bubble my answers in the shape of a heart.
    
    The proctor had squinted at my test for a long, long time. Does the letter S mean something to you? she said finally. I’m getting a name that starts with S. I stared at her, horrified; my sister’s death was still fresh. I moonlight as a psychic on the strip, she explained with a devilish smile.
    
    Whatever, I said, then cut class for the rest of the day, driving in circles with my AC on high.
    
    I’ll be good, I said into Hunter’s deliciously unwashed hair. Don’t have too much fun without me. Then I shouldered her bags and walked her outside, where the taxi was already waiting.
    
     
    
    It was nice to be on my own at first. I watered Hunter’s ferns, I slept in her bed, I did my shitty data entry job from the tub. I took a long walk every afternoon and concocted baroque stir-fries using things I found in her pantry. On the third day I made blondies, thinking of her. I opened a kitchen drawer and found an official-looking form amid rubber bands and takeout menus. It was a list of rules, xeroxed on pale pink paper; on the back of it, the name JULIET had been scribbled. I read it in the kitchen, letting the oven warm my hip –
    
    Who are the ANGELS, you ask? ANGELS bring pleasure & relief to our discerning customers. ANGELS provide an important service to the men who visit us. Our clean & discreet Spa is a temple for many, located at 666 Stockton, open 24/7

    Congratulations! You are now an ANGEL in our clean & private Palace Spa. Please show up to your shift in a WHITE dress or skirt, spaghetti straps OK. Please note: we keep the Palace at a comfortable 72 degrees so long sleeves are not necessary.
    
    I turned off the oven, forsaking my blondies.
    
    From then on the Palace was all I could think about. It followed me like a ghost, like BO. When Hunter texted me selfies from Zero’s guest bedroom, I texted back: missing you!! I didn’t let her in on my turmoil. But every walk I took brought me closer and closer to that side of town until one afternoon, a week after Hunter had left for Nantucket, I went out for some air and found myself at 666 Stockton.
    
    It was the last building on the block, next to the mouth of a smoggy tunnel. A handwritten sign had been taped to the pale pink door – a touch of ecstasy? 3rd flr. I rang the bell and the grate buzzed open; I stepped into a small, dark lobby. The floor was covered in junk mail. I read the fake-sounding names of the other businesses on their mail slots: Life Options Inc., Favorite Models & Talent, Forevermore Financial. There was no elevator, just an empty shaft with a chair placed in front of it and another handwritten sign that said broken!!!!, so I took the stairs. I didn’t have a plan; I felt swimmy and blank, like when I drank after work at The Nugget and emptied my mind, wearing a tank top that still smelled of cum because I didn’t see the point in washing something that would be dirtied again and again. I would sit at the bar and become a vessel, a whistle, a ceramic dog on a shelf – useless until used.
    
    I reached the third floor and entered a room, high-ceilinged and airy. It was furnished by neutral-hued beanbags and white shag rugs. White plastic roses had been strung vertically from the ceiling, causing me to stoop. Along the far wall was a series of closed doors, each labeled with a plaque: love angel, touch angel, my angel, go angel. It smelled of baby powder and expensive shampoo. A horde of tan, leggy girls lounged about, clad in white tube tops, knee-socks, tennis skirts, scrunchies, gossiping crisscross-applesauce. One girl sat by the window, blanched by the late-afternoon light, knitting a baby hat in a white microkini. I felt like I’d walked into a casting call for a Xanax commercial and/or a porno so softcore as to be holy. A limby older woman with long blonde hair sat on an exercise ball behind a desk, writing in a diary with an actual lock. She beamed at me as I entered. Welcome! she called in a clipped Slavic accent. She wore the key to the diary on a chain around her neck. How can I help you, my love?
    
    Oh . . . I glanced around; the girls had formed a chorus line in the center of the room. I felt lurid as a stop sign in my dirty pink sweatpants, unsure of what I wanted or why I had come. I was j-just wondering . . . if y’all are still hiring. I wiped my palms on my ass. My friend Juliet referred me.
    
    Oh! The woman clutched her throat. She wore a loose white slip that gave away the shape of her ass when she stood in a sunbeam. We love Juliet! The girls bobbed their heads, a breeze through a cornfield. Even the floor-length lace curtains swelled at her name. Any friend of Juliet’s is a friend of mine. We are pretty fully staffed these days, but let me see what I can do . . . She floated to her desk and began to flip through the diary. And Juliet told you what we do here at the Palace? It’s, how you say, specific. Her voice was level, betraying nothing.
    
    Yes, I said slowly. She showed me the, um, rules.
    
    The woman smiled. Guidelines, not rules. She jabbed her finger at the diary. Would you look at that! Camilla called out sick tonight. She works nights, 10 p.m. to 3 a.m.; that’s when we get the broken hearts’ club. Could you come back then?
    
    Sure, I heard myself saying. I could do that.
    
    Perfect! the woman cried. The universe works in mysterious ways. She handed me a packet of papers to sign, all pale pink and smelling of vanilla. You can call me Phaedra. And you are?
    
    I answered without thinking. I’m Laney, I said, then felt a clunk in my gut, like I’d made a mistake, like I’d given something away.
    
    Laney, she said, fingering the key at her throat. I feel good about you, Laney. She touched my hair, before quickly retracting her hand. I think you’ll be a natural.
    
    Thank you, I muttered, edging toward the door. I agreed to return later that night, then saw myself out. The girls called goodbye as I took the stairs two at a time, their raised voices like a lullaby when you’re trying to stay awake.
    
     
    
    Did I stop to consider what this experiment entailed, this double doggy dare? I did. Pacing Hunter’s apartment, I knew it was a bad idea. I knew that I could walk away. And yet I returned at 9.50 p.m. in a white eyelet sundress I’d found in Hunter’s give-away pile, smelling of orchids and dread.
    
    I’d assumed Phaedra would train me herself, that I’d spend my first shift in the shadows. Instead I was once-overed by a wispy knockout named Demi, who wore bridal lingerie and her hair in two buns. Howdy partner, she said. That was all. There were six other girls on the schedule for the late shift. Phaedra had already gone home for the night.
    
    So we just . . . wait? I said, toying with a plastic rose. I hadn’t thought to bring a book; I’d thought only of Hunter and the weird ways she touched men for pay. That fixation had brought me here, to the scene of the crime, which no longer seemed so criminal. Behind me, two girls played Twister, their full mugs of tea dangerously close to the mat.
    
    Demi glanced at me over the top of her Architectural Digest and shrugged. Pretty much, she said. A little dust-colored dog lay in her lap. Ninety percent of our business is walk-ins. Until someone comes, we just chill.
    
    The first customer arrived at 10.20 p.m. As soon as the doorbell rang, the girls around me sprang to their feet and formed a semicircle in the center of the room. The man who entered was nondescript, wearing a hoodie and jeans; he smelled vaguely of refried beans. He immediately pointed to a surfer-y chick on the end and said, C’mon over here, Kylie. She took him by the hand and led him to the room marked my angel, the two of them murmuring like sweethearts.
    
    Over the course of the night, men drifted in and out; though we displayed ourselves each time, the vast majority called out the name of their favorite girl and barely glanced at the rest of us. I tried to detect a change in the men as they left but they generally looked the same, perhaps a bit pinker in the cheeks.
    
    I felt invisible until almost midnight, when an older gentleman walked in. He was smartly dressed, as though on his way to the opera, with some sort of woodsy oil in what was left of his hair. Unlike the other customers, he took his time appraising us, making thoughtful little grunts. When he saw me, he clapped a hand to his mouth in pretend surprise. New girl? he said. Demi nodded and said, She’s filling in for Camilla.
    
    Well then, he said, I’d be happy to show her the ropes.
    
    I stared at Demi. Her face was smooth, vacant, as though we worked at a pretzel place in the mall. This way, she said, leading us both to the room marked thee angel. She held the door open and whispered to me, Don’t worry, he’s a regular. He knows the rules. Then she smiled and cooed, Enjoy yourselves! before shutting the door.
    
    A salt lamp cast soft rippled light on the walls of our room, which was barely bigger than a closet. Everything was dim and pink. The room contained a massage-bed covered in waxy white paper that made me think doctors, a folding chair, and an end table with a clock and a box of tissues. The tissues perturbed me most; I tried to think of the last time I’d dealt in cum, that spidery goo, its chlorine aftertaste. The room itself smelled of cloves and cinnamon, no trace of bodies past. The folding chair, I learned, was for the customer’s clothes.
    
    I’m Ernesto, the man said, taking my hand in both of his. He reminded me of a professor. Then he turned his back to me and dutifully stripped to his boxers, which were surprisingly dingy, frayed at the hem. He folded his coat over the back of the chair, then sat on the table. I’m all yours, he said with a pep that unnerved me. He swung his legs back and forth.
    
    OK, I whispered. Great. My heart ping-ponged inside my chest. I was sweating so badly that little capital Ds had formed under the arms of my dress. So, I said, laboring to sound normal, what are you looking for tonight?
    
    An ending, he said matter-of-factly. The soup du jour.
    
    A . . . I could barely get the words out . . . happy ending, you mean?
    
    He chuckled, not unkindly. Not necessarily, he said. Whatever comes naturally. We’ll see how it goes.
    
    I reached out to touch him, then withdrew my hand. His skin was alarmingly hot. Sensing my hesitation, he stood. Are you nervous? he said. His smile was gentle.
    
    I nodded. A little.
    
    I get it, he said. It takes some getting used to. He gestured to the table. Lie down. His chest was like a diner pancake, squishy and beige. Just try not to move.
    
    Oh, I said, feeling my stomach twist. OK . . . I lay face down on the massage table, feeling the paper crinkle under me. He’d warmed it up with his thighs. I closed my eyes and tried to empty my mind, prepare myself. I waited for his touch, slimy or dry. I could smell his piney hair oil and anti-itch cream. I can always overpower him, I thought to myself. I weighed at least thirty pounds more than he did; this thought comforted me.
    
    But he didn’t touch me. I heard him circling the table. He was suddenly agitated, unsettled. Oh, he whimpered. Oh, oh, oh. He gripped the edge of the table with unexpected ferocity. No! he cried out, his voice both childish and ancient. I felt something wet on the back of my neck. Ernesto was crouched over me, weeping into my hair. Why? he moaned. Why? He sounded so sad that I began to cry too. What will I do without you? he moaned. I don’t want to live without you. I don’t want to be here anymore. When he took a jagged inhale, he made the table shake. I wanted to comfort him but I sensed this would forfeit the game; instead I held my breath and tried not to move, letting my snot drip to the floor. I played dead while Ernesto beat his chest; the sound was like lemons plopping onto a lawn. It isn’t fair, he kept blubbering, it just isn’t fair.
    
    He grieved for what felt like a long time. Eventually his wails petered out into sighs, until the room was quiet but for the occasional sniffle. I felt his papery hand on my shoulder. That was good, he said hoarsely. Very good.
    
    I sat up and was surprised to see that he’d already put his clothes back on. I looked at the clock on the table; only twenty minutes had passed.
    
    Are you OK? I asked. I felt lightheaded.
    
    He nodded, buttoning his coat. Oh, yes! That was just what I needed. I feel so, oh, what’s the word? He clapped his hands together. Refreshed. And it was true that his eyes were shining, his cheeks heartily flushed. What a rush, huh?
    
    I nodded, unsure if I should smile or continue to act somber. Can I . . . do anything else for you?
    
    No can do, kiddo. He floated across the room. Gotta go. My wife is waiting up for me. He stuffed a wad of cash in my hands before waltzing out the door. Till next time, angel.
    
    I sat in the folding chair after he left, thumbing through my money. I couldn’t name what I was feeling. A keen sense of accomplishment, a tingle in my cunt. A piercing loneliness. Residual longing, as though his had flaked off. It was all mushed together in me, a feeling both glitzy and dire. I had expected to feel closer to Hunter but instead I felt distant, zipped into my sadness, like when I used to get stoned and ride the bus alone, pretending to be sober; I would look at the people around me and think, no one knows the truth but me. It was a cozy solipsism, my pain like lucky underwear, meaningful only to me.
    
    Eventually I got up and finger-combed my hair. In the main room I found an empty beanbag by the window and sank down. A stick of incense burned into a teacup on the windowsill. The girl next to me was looking at her phone, laughing without making a sound. When she noticed me, she held out her screen: it showed a picture of a wet cat with the caption BAD HAIR DAY. I closed my eyes and held my breath. I practiced slowing my pulse, quieting my body’s cycles. I felt certain that the next man who walked in would pick me. He would clock my sloped shoulders, grave eyes; he would see that I was made for this, this game of aping death. Behind me, the dust-colored dog gnawed on a rose. I could hear his little grunts of pleasure, but I didn’t turn to look.
    
     
    
    For the rest of the week, I worked the night shift at the Palace.
    
    On Friday I went to a party thrown by Hunter’s friend Ducky. I didn’t want to go but I knew it would make Hunter happy. He likes you, she’d assured me over the phone. Everyone likes you. What’s not to like?
    
    I showed up early in jeans that I’d hacked into shorts. Oh, honey, Ducky said, look at you! I drifted around his apartment and pretended to drink a cocktail he’d named Cher the Blame. Beautiful girls draped themselves into doorways, talking about Last Night. You won’t believe where we ended up last night . . . There was always something happening in their lives that needed to be dissected. No! her friends screeched. You fucking stupid slut! I waited in line for the bathroom and watched two boys make out against a wall. I found myself soothed by the straightforwardness of their actions, the trusty linearity of lust, until one pulled back and said, Are you really chewing gum? They began to bicker; a pile of babes emerged from the bathroom, having apparently all swapped shirts.
    
    I lasted fifteen minutes at Ducky’s. Then I dug out my coat from the heap on the bed and made my way downtown, practicing death on the bus: eyes slitted, mouth ajar. The woman sitting next to me shook my shoulder. Hey, she said, you OK, honey? Hello? Her shopping bags banged into me, a butterfly-like battery, and she looked annoyed when I sat upright. Jesus, she snapped, I thought you had OD’d or something. She gathered her bags and moved to a different seat. I rode the rest of the way with a glow in my gut. I made $900 at the spa that night and slept until well after noon.
    
    Then came the morning when I awoke to a new text from Hunter. Good news!! Z is all healed so I booked a flight home. See you tomorrow my angel!! She sent a selfie, looking Vaseliney but radiant, wearing a shirt I didn’t recognize. My heart swelled at the sight of her: I still couldn’t believe she wanted me. Kiss kiss to my Laney love. You’ll soon be in my arms.
    
    I wasted no time. I cleaned her apartment in a manic spurt. I took a taxi to the gourmet grocery store to get the fancy coffee beans she liked, the weapon-like rye bread. I stripped the sheets and washed everything but the white dress I’d been wearing to work. I needed it for one more night.
    
    I got to the spa at 9.45 p.m., my wet hair in two braids. Things picked up quickly. By 1.30 a.m. I’d seen five dudes and made enough money to pay rent for two months. When the doorbell rang again and we scrabbled into place, I felt focused, lit up. I angled my body toward the door and was surprised to see a woman walk in. Phaedra greeted her fluidly, petting her hand. Welcome! she sang. Make yourself comfortable, no rush, no rush. Everyone acted normal as the woman appraised us, worrying the strap of her purse.
    
    It was difficult to gauge her age; she’d had a lot of work done. The skin of her cheeks was stretched taut, her lips like deflated party balloons. She had a sullen feline look, her green eyes flecked with yellow, her body poky and small in a neat black skirt suit. Her legs had the slightly wet look of nylons, something I hadn’t seen since I worked at The Nugget, guiding retirees to the smoking floor. It was impossible to tell what this woman was feeling, if she’d be sweet and melty in a room or demanding, punitive. I’d been lucky in my week at the spa; all my customers had been easy sells. The fact of my breasts hushed them. These men responded well to my directness; as soon as we entered a room, I asked if they wanted an ending, then lay down on the table and let the mourning begin. I felt sure of my skills as a corpse. I’d eavesdropped on enough of the other girls’ conversations, however, to know that men could get greedy; sometimes they wanted more, something splashy and brutal, a more obvious violence. They sought a haunted house, not a drowsy sorority. Some of them demanded refunds from Phaedra because their girl ‘fidgeted’ or ‘didn’t sell it’, because her skin was too warm or that she was ticklish. They came for gore and got freeze-tag instead. Child’s play, I heard one man grumble on his way out. Too light, too fluffy. What fucking happened to darkness?
    
    Now the woman pointed at me with a French-tipped nail. Her blonde hair was streaked with silver. You, she said meekly. I think I’d like to see you. Then she turned to Phaedra and stage-whispered, Just so you know, your elevator is broken.
    
    I led her into love angel. After you, I said, remembering to smile. You can take your clothes off, if you like.
    
    She held her purse with both hands, like she was boarding a bus in the bad part of town. All right, she murmured. She took off her kitten heels first, lining them up under the chair; she had trouble with her skirt’s zipper but didn’t ask for help. There was a shyness to her movements, a skittish femininity that felt almost teenaged, like she’d not yet acclimated to fleshiness, like her hips might be a hoax. She had to sit down on the chair to take off her nylons, which she then held in her hand like two snakeskins. I’d prefer to keep my underwear on, she said, if it’s OK with you.
    
    Whatever you like. I tried not to stare at her strappy beige girdle. The skin of her legs was smooth and white, like a new tub of ice cream. Perhaps because she was a woman I could pick up on her fear; I heard it in her pauses, I saw it in the way she smiled without meaning to. It made me uncomfortable though I tried to speak calmly. Have you been here before?
    
    Oh, no. She looked at the ceiling, still gripping her nylons. My husband used to come here. Quite a lot, actually. I found the name of this place in his diary. Over and over. He was rather . . . obsessed.
    
    Did he die? I asked before I could stop myself.
    
    She smiled, then covered her mouth with her hand. No, she said. He left me. She forced a laugh. I suppose he could be dead by now. Who knows? She touched her throat. Anyway, I was curious. She left it at that.
    
    Well, I’m happy you’re here. I smoothed out my dress. Why don’t I get on up the table and we’ll take it from there?
    
    Oh. Her eyes flashed with panic, as if I’d gone in for a kiss. Perhaps I misunderstood. I was hoping I could . . . be the one to lie down? She gestured to the table. I’d like to try it that way, if it’s OK with you.
    
    Of course! My voice was too loud; I felt my heart skitter. Whatever you like!
    
    I helped her onto the table, the paper barely puckering under her weight. She was so dainty, so thin; she reminded me of a ballerina, that studied frailty. She lay face down, her arms at her sides; some of her gray hairs stuck straight up from static. Like this? she said.
    
    Perfect. I took a long breath. Now just relax and stay still.
    
    The room went silent. For one moment I blanked. Then I closed my eyes and thought of the things I tried not to. I thought of Nevada at night, the black desert cleaved by neon. I thought of the first house we grew up in, the gravel yard, the yellow plaque above the kitchen sink that read dogs eat first. Everywhere we moved, this plaque came too. I thought of the La-Z-Boy my mother would sleep in, stinking of menthols and tiger balm. Sometimes I rubbed her feet while Sophia rubbed her shoulders. My sweet girls, Mom would mutter before she became incoherent. I thought of the bunk bed I shared with Sophia, put together by a so-called friend of our mom’s we both found so handsome we’d go mute when he visited. It’s the skinny twins, he teased us. He and my mom drank Twisted Teas and watched TV; when American Idol was on, they let us watch too. One summer he painted butterflies on the walls of our bedroom, something we’d later get in trouble for with the landlord. Trouble, trouble. Nevada was sunsets, nervy and pink; it was oranges for dinner because it was too hot to cook, it was driving while smoking and getting in trouble with people who did far worse.
    
    When I was in high school, my mother asked me, Did Jeremiah ever touch you? That was the name of her friend. No way! I cried. Never! I felt angry at her for suggesting it, for scrambling my memory of a man who’d been kind. It felt unfair of her to pin him as our family’s bogeyman, as if by singling him out she could undo her own failures, as if he could be blamed for my lack of ambition and Sophia’s depressive spells, which got longer each time. We both knew Sophia felt sad but I never thought it was serious. She’s wound up, I would say when friends asked why she wasn’t eating or speaking. Too many Red Bulls. I wouldn’t find out until Sophia’s memorial that our father had killed himself too. Runs in the family, a distant aunt sighed. Chemical imbalance and all that jazz. She licked egg salad off her fingers. Take care of yourself, love. He even did it the same way as she did: slit wrists in a shower stall because we didn’t have a tub.
    
    I touched my cheek; it was damp. The little pink massage room went wavy as I wept. Sophia, I whispered. I miss you. I miss you. It was all that I could think to say. The woman on the table lay perfectly still. When I looked at her back, I didn’t see Sophia. I just saw a body, hard angles, crimped skin. I got closer and studied the sunspots on her shoulders, little cappuccino stains. I wondered if my mother had them too; she loved to sit in the yard on her one day off, sunbathing with the dogs. Sunscreen is for narcs, she’d bark, her skin turning the color of rotisserie chicken. Even on triple-digit days she wore jeans. I never once saw my mother in shorts; a lifer waitress at a big-shot steakhouse, she was embarrassed of her varicose veins. She and this woman could be the same age. I let my gaze linger on the woman’s bare legs, a pink rash on her upper thighs as if they had been touched too much. For the first time I wondered: did my mom shave her legs? Did she ever wear a bathing suit? Did she have a secret tattoo, a rose or the initials of an ex-lover on the crook of her thigh? My eyes drifted up and I noticed blonde fuzz on the back of the woman’s neck. It struck me that everyone must have this, a soft spot, a hinge; she had had that fuzz there since she was a baby. I began to cry harder, thinking not of Sophia but of my mother’s dumb plaque. The last time I’d been home the plaque was hung up over the sink, which was cluttered with the baby bottles she used to feed her dogs. That was many years ago now but I didn’t need to go back to know it was still there. So much shredded, lost to time, and that was what remained.
    
    I managed to stop crying with five minutes left on the clock. You can get up now, I said. Take your time. I extended my hand and helped the woman off the table. Her eyes were glassy.
    
    Thank you, she whispered, slithering into her skirt. For the first time, she struck me as ravishing. I tried not to stare as she put on her tights. Her lips were the color of a box of chocolates.
    
    I hovered by the door, snotty tissues in my hand. My teeth were chattering, my cheeks ablaze. There was something I wanted to say to her but I didn’t know what. I felt the giddiness of a crush, the neediness of a kitten; perhaps this was the post-grieving rush Ernesto so craved, a zippy sense of having been flayed.
    
    At last the woman was dressed; she fluffed her hair and stood up. Well, she said. She seemed embarrassed, as if I were a stranger who had fainted in her lap. Neither of us knew how to name what we had shared. She licked her lips and forced a smile. How much do I owe you?
    
    My heart cramped but I managed to smile back. $400, I muttered, not including tip.
    
    I looked at the floor as she scrounged in her purse. Suddenly she couldn’t leave fast enough for me. I wanted to go home, take off this damp dress, disappear in Hunter’s bed. I wanted to fill her apartment with roses, real ones that would die. I wanted to pick her up from the airport and kiss her on the throat and say, Don’t leave me alone again. I no longer cared who Juliet was; Hunter was touchable, warm in the night. She often went to bed in pajamas and awoke in the nude. The woman handed me a wad of twenties. That should do the trick, she chirped, not looking at me.
    
    I took the cash. Thanks.
    
    Thank you, she echoed, her voice soft and far. And that was that. I held open the door and she left. I listened for the sound of her kitten heels on the stairs; instead I heard the elevator creaking to life. Phaedra must’ve finally called a handyman, I thought. Just my luck; it gets fixed on my very last night at the Palace. But by the time my shift ended and I was on my way back to Hunter’s, the elevator was out of service again, a hasty sign taped to the doors – don’t go."

    "text": "I was miserable that summer, but had little pity for myself because it was not the result of some tragic, isolated incident but of nothing other than my own personal shortcomings. I had broken things off for good with the psychiatrist – down the line we reconnected, but that summer I was twenty-three and over-certain about the way of things. I’d finally begun to outgrow the ascetic worldview I’d been raised on, newly understanding that romance was the bread and butter of life, and that the termination of a relationship didn’t signify its failure, but still I felt that losing my grip over heartache wasn’t within my financial means. I had no income, was a graduate student of the worst kind – art school – and I wasn’t even one of those creatives who could make art out of a heartbreak. No, for me, heartbreak meant breathing shallowly in bed until the cracks of my eyes burned from salt and any hint of sunlight made me flinch.

 

    The semester ended in the first week of May, after which I was supposed to go home to Fukushima for a month until the start of my internship. The internship was poorly paid, but I had wanted it badly in order to structure my summer around my writing. Before that, though, I had to return to Fukushima to take care of my mother. There wasn’t anything wrong with her other than that she was lonely. It was probable that, despite being around people more regularly as a condition of youth, I was even lonelier than she was; but, while loneliness wasn’t something I minded for myself, it bothered me considerably to think of my mother as lonely. Besides, the pulsating cries of forest cicadas would, in a satisfying manner, mirror the throes of getting over the psychiatrist. But when I went to the pharmacy to get PCR-tested the day before my flight, the results came back positive. I’d had the virus months earlier and knew I couldn’t have contracted it again so soon. Do you have a record of a positive test? asked the travel agent, when I tried to explain this on the phone. If I did, it would be lost in the dumps of trash heaps in some far-off borough, exported from the garbage chute of the psychiatrist’s apartment where we had quarantined together, a week during which I had been the sicker one and he had taken care of me, a real doctor with a permanent pinch between his dark, pensive eyes.
    
     
    
    The travel agent hung up. I was lying face-up in a sliver of space at the foot of my bed, the rest taken up by stacks of books and other items I had planned to fit inside the suitcase on the floor. I didn’t bother removing the phone from my ear. Somehow, the virus had stayed in my system, and I was unable to resist extrapolating some cosmic meaning from the endurance of both the virus and my heartache. Loud banging noises of cupboards opening and closing came from the kitchenette. Emily, undoubtedly trying to fix something she deemed disorganized, although no matter how much things moved around she wasn’t satisfied. It was the apartment itself she had a problem with, it not only lacking storage space, but furnished with old, rickety appliances. Each bang shot down the slim corridor that led to my small room.
    
     
    
    It was evening, but daytime in Fukushima. I imagined my mother’s slippered feet pattering around the wooden slats of our home, making preparations for my arrival. I could see her fingers working through a pile of anchovies on a paper towel, using her thumbnail to slice through the silver bellies and extract ropes of intestines. It was the meditative kind of work that took her back to when I still lived at home. Since I’d left she had been languishing in search of something of equal demand to occupy her. I picked up the phone, heard three long rings. Oka-san? Hai! She answered with an invigorated laugh. Your voice is good? I said. Ah-ha, is that so? So I played a little last night. . . It took me aback to hear she had anything close to a night of fun. My mother was the kind of person who moaned about a headache after a sip of alcohol, and rarely left the confines of our house, claiming she was too weak boned for physical activity. What could fun entail for her?
    
     
    
    She was alarmed by the sudden change of plans, then quickly reasoned there was nothing to be done. She sounded resigned, as if going on about it tired her. Maybe I could make it in a few weeks, I said. What about your job? I could push it back. No, no, she said. That’s no attitude to show your employer. She fell quiet. We used to spend hours on the phone, speaking only occasionally, accompanying each other’s long and sullen silences until one of us trudged up a forgotten, trivial topic, but recently I’d noticed a shift in her behavior. She was quick to want to hang up, mentioning a golf lesson or a lunch appointment. Hoka ni iitai koto wa aru? Is there something else you wanted to say? Her voice sounded subaqueous, and my eyes stung as I gazed out of my air shaft.
    
     
    
    My mother hung up. I forced myself into my desk chair, turning a new page of my notebook. On the page, there was the sentence I had written and rewritten, the same slants of my handwriting forming a gray wall. For weeks, I had been sitting at my desk for hours at a time, thinking that by doing so I would be bound to write something. But I only became amazed by the fact that I could dedicate so much time to accomplishing nothing. Yet there was the occasional morning – when it was early enough that there was no sound and I felt rested but still in that numinous sphere of consciousness where I hadn’t yet succumbed to the unoriginal thoughts of daily life – I would write a sentence whose pith collided with a dimension of the unknown, silently surpassing the bounds of intelligence that generated it, and I would feel a bright beam of inspiration that carried me until the next rare moment, which sometimes wouldn’t arrive for weeks.
    
     
    
    Hello, anyone home? It was Emily. Can we talk out here? she asked. I was still not used to my door being closed in the first place, something we both started doing since Jacob, her boyfriend, began coming in and out of the apartment. In the beginning, I had tried to get to know him, but instead of reinforcing mine and Emily’s commonality it had only made his presence more prominent. He made a habit of tidying things, and the apartment became less cluttered. Objects receded into the rooms of their original owners, taking with them the taut energy that had run between us for half a decade. For a week, we had been stuck in one of our regular ruts of ignoring each other, not speaking upon returning home and listening for when the other person was in the bathroom, or kitchenette, so that we wouldn’t use it at the same time. The air remained sealed tight until one of us left the apartment, and the hide-and-seek could go on for weeks. I consoled myself that this was a natural reaction to two people living together in cramped quarters, which shouldn’t worry me because it was an equally natural reaction for the heat to crest and resolve itself. Do I have to come get you? She called out. When I could bear to sit up, I opened my door. I squinted, shielding my eyes from the bright fixture in the narrow hallway. When I stepped down onto the hardwood floor I instantly felt a small stab on the bottom of my foot, but when I lifted my foot underneath the light I couldn’t see anything.
    
     
    
    I hobbled into the kitchenette, sliding into the chair across her at the table. One second, I said, craning my neck to examine what it was that had stabbed me, though I already knew it was a tiny shard of glass from a frame I had dropped a year ago, which had shattered into tiny pieces that spread everywhere. At the time I had collected and discarded them, worried that Emily would step on one at some point. An entire year had gone by without incident, and now blood gushed down the curve of my foot. I had the urge to make a joke about the symbolism behind the source of my pain being invisible, to share a laugh with her that would, in its resulting joy, entirely obliterate the tension of the past few weeks, or to at least see her grin in response to me, but I was dissuaded by her furrowed look of concentration. It’s glass, I said instead. Oh god, she gasped, jolting towards paper towels and a pair of tweezers. Emily took my foot in her lap, frowning intently at the extent of the bleeding. I took my foot back and jabbed at where I thought the shard might be, finally getting it out by squeezing the skin around it. Emily sat back in her chair, wiping her forehead with the back of her hand. Sorry, I said. What did you want to talk about? Emily shook her head, saying, Nothing. It’s not important. This was a lie, I thought, but didn’t push the matter.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    I spent the following week alternating between my desk and wasting in bed, only leaving to use the bathroom and, on my way back, reach into the kitchenette to grab a plum from the diminishing stack which was all I had to eat. My body subsisted on some lower level of being, like those desert frogs that could lay dormant under a scrim of mud, with barely a heart rate, for decades. I hardly kept track of anything, including my phone, so it was then that I almost missed the email from Chiara Pastorino, the Italian writer who had taught me last semester. The email read simply, Ciao – would you like to babysit my boys next week, 5 p.m. on the 16th?
    
     
    
    That spring, at the tail end of the semester, Chiara had hosted class in her home due to a graduate student worker protest being staged at the university. Class had been winding down one night when I heard the click of the hidden front door and the chirping of children’s voices, to which I refocused my waning attention. There were two boys, the younger of them a toddler who couldn’t walk without wobbling. Upon spotting Chiara sitting in her wingback chair, her long, slender arms raised mid-air as she taught, he raced toward her, climbing up into her lap and touching her face. It shocked me to see her, whose serious demeanor translated even onto her poised and angular body which she kept under drapes of black silks, be poked and grabbed without dignity. She seemed embarrassed to be seen like this and shot glances at the part-time nanny who stood by the front door. The woman seemed timid, unwilling to encroach upon our learning space, so I got up, lifting the toddler into my arms and rocking him on a kitchen stool. Chiara usually showed irritation at any deviant classroom behavior, but the glance she gave me shifted from hesitant to trusting. After class she briefly let me entertain the child with toy blocks as she answered my questions about Keats, and what Coetzee meant by the terms of a well-made realist story.
    
     
    
    I would have stayed longer, but I was dreading the two-transfer journey home on the train and the prospect of being awake when the sky turned dark. The next day, I would tie myself to my desk, writing. Without the psychiatrist, a space had cleared up in my life, from which I generated an amount of focus and productivity which left me spent and wondrous in its aftermath. Still, any little phrase that reminded me of him shot me back to how things had been when I was with him, when we reached for each other at night, in search of each other’s sedative touch. Only in those solitary blips did I admit to myself how weak with happiness he made me, a kind of happiness I couldn’t experience even with Emily, with whom my friendship ran deeper, like an ancient river. That realization, that even the strongest of friendships could not overcome biology, was the greatest heartbreak of my early twenties.
    
     
    
    During those months without him, on some weekend nights, I was forced to go out by Emily. She dangled from my side, boasting to everyone that I was getting an MFA., drunkenly emphasizing each letter as if it had the cachet of the FBI, or the CIA. Guess what that stands for? I asked, and this elicited crooked smiles. Masters in Finance Associates? Master of Film Art? Masters in Finance Arts? It was my lame joke that was fun for no one, not even me. Half the men out at these clubs were there because their bodies required it – it was, the most articulate of them explained, a reflex to enduring ninety-hour work weeks. I nodded as they downed tequila shots, looking handsome when they grimaced at the bitter taste. We would leave together, their fingers spinning me as the thumping of the music faded and we wobbled down the streets and into a yellow cab. They looked sophisticated, at ease with their arms draped above the black vinyl banquette, and with my head against their chest I would be having a good time, but then the cab would halt to a stop and it would be time to pay. They’d bend over and I’d lift my head, and in the fragment of a second before shoving their credit cards into the machine slots, a choked look would flash on their faces that belied their youth and the truth would come out that they were pretending. They didn’t know anything more about life than I did.
    
     
    
    Chiara lived in a family co-op in Crown Heights. It was a twelve-minute walk from the subway station, a large brown building without much character or style. The lobby had a complicated bell system, but a friendly woman with a stroller chatting in the lobby caught my face through the glass pane and let me in. Chiara lived in a fifth-floor unit. I knocked twice then turned the knob, stepping into a narrow hallway which I was surprised to see cluttered with backpacks, shoes, and more piles of stuff on stools. Come inside, come in, Chiara suddenly materialized, her Italian drawl distorted by her frenzy of getting ready. Great to see you, I said. I sat down in a chair clutching my tote as she paced in and out of the kitchen. I understood retroactively that she wiped the apartment of photos when class had been held – photos that had since been put back: ones from her wedding, trips, and joyous moments of what I took to be various landmarks of the boys’ babyhoods. I stared intently at one taken at the beach, Chiara’s stomach exposed and round, pregnant with one of the boys. I wanted to look closer but pulled away. The fact that she had left them out signaled she was entrusting me with something, which I didn’t want to jeopardize. I heard a loud clatter of pots and pans, and I got up from the chair to check on her in the kitchen.
    
     
    
    She had set a pot, two cans of Campbell soup, and two bowls atop the kitchen counter. When I walked in, she looked at me then pointed at them with the cigarette she was smoking. She spoke, but the words were obscured by her accent. I felt myself tense up as if we were in class, where I expended a disproportionate amount of effort trying to decipher her. She cleared her throat and repeated, If you could serve them dinner, gesturing at a Post-it note with instructions on the fridge. Oh, of course, I said. She tapped her cigarette on the glass ashtray by the window. I admired the confidence it took to smoke in a household of children – something my mother would have balked at but to me seemed courageous. So, she said, huskily. How are you? Her eyes were half-opened slits. She seemed far then from her novels proudly lined up on her bookshelf, from the steely author photo I so admired and showed anyone I got the chance to, saying, Look how beautiful she is, look, as if it was something that related back to me. I changed the subject by asking where she was heading off to. A friend’s art event, she tried explaining to me but I understood only abstractly. Although I was younger than my classmates, ever since discerning my ambition, she had treated me with a reciprocal seriousness that meant a great deal to me. She took a last long drag and looked at me before saying, You don’t have to wait for me. I stood before her feeling slow until I realized what she meant: that I was there to watch over her children, which in the overwhelming pull of her presence I had forgotten about entirely.
    
     
    
    I started down the narrow hallway following the raucous sounds, pushing open a door. The boys were wrestling in the hull of a bed shaped like a ship, Henry’s butt smashing down on Kian’s gleeful face. Upon noticing me they quieted down, suspending their play to gaze at me, and I gazed back, my heart flushing with a female sensation. I had forgotten their ages and found it difficult to guess them in the same way that, when I was a child, the ages of adults had all blurred together.
    
     
    
    Hey, guys, I said, stepping over the toys that scattered the floor. Henry loosened his grip on Kian, who came running toward me, the bottoms of his feet slapping the floor and his face bright and open like a sunflower. He dragged my hand, handling me roughly as he bolted to the far corners of the room to hand me different kinds of toys, as if it were a timed mission. Henry smiled goofily, watching his brother race around, occasionally glancing at me as I received each new item from Kian and showered him with praise.
    
     
    
    Kian, what’s this? I asked, crouching down to the floor where there was a half-finished puzzle game. Once I sat down, showing interest, Kian came over to stop me, wanting instead for me to watch him complete the puzzles. At first Henry seemed shy, trying to appear above these childish games, but once I cajoled and integrated him into our play, he became competitive. I encouraged Kian, completing some for him and placing the pieces he needed near his hand. Yet he didn’t seem bothered by losing; in fact, I wasn’t even sure he knew he was competing, only that he was elated to be with his brother, that a game meant for him was becoming the center of all our attentions.
    
     
    
    I had babysat before. For some reason, never boys, and not in years, but I would have taken any opportunity to feel close to Chiara. I turned, catching her gray eyes watching me from the door. Anticipating her departure, the boys abandoned me and rushed over to clutch Chiara’s pant legs. She stood calmly, her fingers reaching down and ruffling their auburn heads. Henry’s sunburned, that’s why he looks like this, she said. Oh, I replied. Should I put aloe on his face? I asked. Henry yelped, darting away from both of us to the ship. Chiara’s black eyebrows soared up before her eyes resettled on me. Dinner’s at six. Kian goes into his bath by seven, then once he’s done, Henry can run his own bath. Kian likes to be read a couple books before bedtime at eight, and he may plead with you to get into bed with him, but you mustn’t. Henry may stay up reading in our bed until Kian falls asleep. If there’s any trouble, Henry knows the low-down. When will you be back? I asked. Late, she said wearily, heading for the door. It was only after she left that I realized she hadn’t left a number to call in case of anything, which was alarming until I recognized the omission as deliberate and synchronous with her personality.
    
     
    
    I left the boys to play, stepping into the kitchen where the lights had been left on and made all the reflective surfaces appear bright and angry. I rummaged around unselfconsciously. The fridge was packed so tightly that looking at any one thing too closely overwhelmed me. Packs of yogurt, string cheese, mandarins, and what looked like leftover salads and tortellini sealed tightly in red-covered Tupperware. Atop the fridge were crates of juice boxes and several different bags of bread, and whichever cabinet I opened was stacked with boxes: pasta, oatmeal, applesauce. A large array of pots and pans hung on the wall. No space was left unused. I stood in disbelief about how much it took to feed a family of four when something brushed my shins. I jumped back; a cat, old and gray with patches of missing fur, turned away from me and lowered its head over a bowl of food in the room’s corner. I opened the soup cans, pulling the tab rings and feeling the smooth metal tear. Inside, pockets of grease floated on a dull yellow surface. I emptied the contents into the pot, stirring occasionally because it seemed like the correct thing to do.
    
     
    
    I prepared the bowls, placing two ice cubes in Kian’s as instructed on the Post-it. I waited for the soup to boil, turning the empty cans in my hands. I was surprised Chiara hadn’t cooked something more nutritious for me to heat up. My mother had not once let me eat canned soup, making all my meals from ingredients she chopped, diced, and minced with her own hands, standing for hours in the kitchen while I sat at the dining table, going down a math practice book with the AC wind blowing on me. On the phone, I had begun telling her about ways American mothers behaved in hopes of making her feel superior about her more meticulous methods, but after the initial burst of delight, her voice dropped into prolonged silence, indicating doubt about what her extra efforts had all been for, given, I knew, my failed career choice. Once I was in high school, so battered by the years of fighting my mother’s erratic, violent outbursts which had completely fazed and destroyed me in childhood but I gradually understood to be the only possible outcomes of her extreme and lifelong self-abnegation, deferring every one of her wants and needs to her parents, spouse, and child, my feelings of guilt and sorriness for her transpired into ones of anger. I became firm in my conviction that she had been wrong. I blamed her for her labor and told her that she should have fed and raised me with less care, hiring someone to watch me while she went out and lived her life, that it was for those reasons that I had no space to breathe and had to leave her, which resulted in both of us stranded on opposite ledges of the world. Yet once I got even older, whenever I felt I reached the brink of doing something majorly stupid, something that was bad even for me, I found myself unable to go through with it due to my inability to forget the fierce love with which she had raised me.
    
     
    
    It took until the soup came to a boil to feel that Chiara was truly gone, that I was expected to assume her role for the night. I turned the stove off, and with each stir, my aloneness shifted from being the reason for my worries to the reason for my confidence – I no longer had to compete with her. Alone with the boys, now, I was their mother. I could pretend that things had taken the other turn with the psychiatrist, that it was years into the future, when the dust had settled, and we were living the good life he had wanted for us. I was a mother with two living and breathing boys, whose existence was the most inarguable achievement. It was just another night. I had finished preparing a meal for our family, one ear attuned to the boys playing, and any moment I would hear the echo of his footsteps grow louder in the hallway and come to a stop. The metal combination of the front door would unspool, and the door would unlock. I ladled soup into Kian’s toy-like bowl and a bigger portion into Henry’s, before sticking my head out in the hall. Boys, dinner’s almost ready.
    
     
    
    When I stepped out of the kitchen with the bowls of soup, they were already sitting comfortably on the couch, engrossed in Toy Story. Here you go, I said, and they extended their arms to me. I sat down in Chiara’s wingback, which somehow resembled her. I watched as the boys ate their first spoonfuls, unexpectedly delighted when they ate so well. Behind the chair was an entire wall of books, some ledges displaying more photographs.
    
     
    
    I looked back at the boys, then at the photos to try and see in which ways they resembled Chiara, and in which ways they resembled their father, whose face didn’t capture my attention as well as Chiara’s. She was that rare kind of woman who could be the oldest in any room but still the most beautiful. I picked up the frame closest to me, leaning in to observe her in the arms of her husband, both of them facing a setting sun. All the photos revealed a private part of her that was carefree – a stark comparison to the dark and brooding writer who had taught class with such severity that she needed to punctuate the hours with smoking. As I held the picture in my hands, it felt inviolably true to me that if I had agreed to start a life with the psychiatrist, perhaps there still would be the books I would write, but not the ones I had meant to write. I had no proof of this, and in the days I spent unable to get out of bed, I wrestled over whether this was true, or if denying the psychiatrist had simply been a pointless act of self-hatred – an effort to commit some productive act in my relationships while I was unable to be productive in my work. I sank deeper into the chair, and the cat that had been circling around my ankles jumped into my lap, driving the flat top of its head into the inner parts of my legs. It wanted my touch, and I rubbed its back with one hand while with the other I covered my eyes.
    
     
    
    A warm touch spread over my kneecap. I blinked, surprised to see Kian standing in front of my chair. His shirt was dribbled with soup, but his smile was triumphant as he reached up for me to lift him. The cat jumped off as I pulled him on. What’s the matter? I asked. I held onto his lower back as he faced me, his grin stretching wider upon receiving my attention. He would not stop being cheery, and I felt sorry I could not match his enthusiasm for life. He crawled down to reach the small cabinet beside the chair I hadn’t even noticed, pulling out one toy instrument after another: first a tambourine, then a mini accordion, then a drum set, each one larger and more elaborate than the one before that I was stunned by the sheer volume of objects suddenly coming into view. Watch this, he said, trying to demonstrate the drums, but the power was turned off and he cast a forlorn look. I turned it on, willing to endure the abrasive honks. He warbled words I couldn’t decipher, but he didn’t seem to mind. As he continued poking and grabbing at me, occupying my attention, the possibility flickered through me that he had put his hand on my knee as comfort, which moved me.
    
     
    
    So much energy poured out of him that I could not keep up, and once or twice I looked the other way. Mommy, he called me. Mommy, look. Seeing the reaction it had in me, he continued calling me Mommy and would not stop, and in the movements of his rapidly darting eyes I sensed the workings of an intelligence that far surpassed his age. Nevertheless, hearing this unlocked something that flooded me with equal measures of hope and despair. Ever since Kian had come over, Henry had been sneaking glances our way. Tenderness for both boys overtook me, and with Kian still in my lap I reached over to the table in front of the couch, where the remote was. I turned off the TV, and Henry’s eyes shot back. Enough of that, I said playfully, and he scampered over to my lap, pushing Kian to the side. The boys wrestled, and as they fell to the hard floor, I became worried. They both kept trying to sit on each other, but each time I thought a cry would break out from injury, I was wrong. They looked angelic with blushed cheeks, and I felt thankful for how strong they were, for the boys’ company, when I would have otherwise been alone. Two brothers. It had been what the psychiatrist had had growing up and wanted as children one day, to which I never presented any opposition, insistent on keeping my inner self closed off to him as a method of self-preservation. The truth was that, at times, my resentment for my mother pulsed so strongly that I did not want to become any more like her by having my own children. I did not want a daughter, but even more so, I did not want a son – a son felt nothing to do with me.
    
     
    
    I could sense the evening advancing, though light still shone through the windows behind the couch. I checked the time and stood up. I’m drawing your bath, Kian, I said, to which he screamed and shot his head up like a gopher, shaking it feverishly. No, no, no! he chanted. I stopped; I hadn’t anticipated resistance. Come on, now. Why not? I tried to reason with him, but he would not stop shaking his head. I went off to the bathroom where the bathtub waited, large, white, and clean. I turned the faucets and closed the door behind me to muffle the thundering gush of water. Kian had hidden behind the couch cushions. I lifted him out and cradled him in my arms, trying to calm him down, but his cheeks burned as he kept swinging his legs. Sit down, I said, pointing a straight finger to the couch, but he scampered to his room. I chose not to immediately engage, instead stacking the toy instruments back inside the cabinet and clearing the cups and bowls in the kitchen. I wet paper towels to wipe up the driblets of soup on the living room floor. I checked on the bathtub then knocked lightly on the boys’ door.
    
     
    
    The room was quiet as I stepped in. I saw them inside the hull of the ship, the mounds of their bodies moving underneath the covers and their pale knuckles gripped over the top sheet. As I stood over them a massive wave of weariness overtook me, and I sat down on the bulwark. I pulled their covers down with such gentleness that it surprised them into capitulation. Their blank, damp faces smiled up at me, and I patted their ruffled heads. Kian, five minutes until bath time. Ten minutes, he said. He blinked his large, green eyes and I wavered. Seven, but that’s it. He raised his arms up in triumph and shot out to his toy bin. The bin was clear, so I could see him reach inside for what looked like a jar of sand. Stop, I said. Don’t touch that. He turned to watch me, then moved his hand slightly to the side to grab an action figure next to the jar of sand. He was testing my limits; I did not know how to react. I passively received each toy he took out, and he worked so quickly that by the time I saw that the chest was almost empty, he was handing me the jar of sand. Time’s up, I said, and ignoring how much he kicked and screamed, I took him to the bathroom where I turned off the faucets and it became so quiet that I thought I had somehow shut off all sound. Come on, I said, rubbing his back before removing his shirt. He was more willing to take off his pants, lightly grabbing onto my shoulders for balance as he removed one leg at a time.
    
     
    
    Good boy, I said, lowering him into the tub. Once in the water, he seemed pleased, blowing raspberries on the surface, and splashing me. I pulled back, but he wouldn’t stop. I rolled up my sleeves. My boat! My boat! He said, pointing, and I saw yet another bin of toys above the toilet tank. I handed him the boat, and he asked for the submarine. I stood, my shadow falling over him as I brought my hands to my waist. No, Kian. You can’t have both. You must choose one. Both! He screamed. No, I repeated, and he lifted one arm, slapping it down to make a large, sweeping splash. Wet fabric latched onto my skin and thin rivulets ran down my ankles. The voice that shot out of my body didn’t seem to come from me, sounding so harsh and sharp-edged, each word landing like a hot lashing, that I was transported to those times in high school when any meal my family ate out together was terrible and sullen, with some anger wrought all over my mother’s face and my father’s forked frown lines as he tapped his phone; the utter depletion of life I felt in their presence. Kian’s eyes stretched out with fear, darting between me and something else. I turned, catching Henry by the door. Instantly I filled with regret. I patted down my clothes, spotting a bottle above the bathroom sink. Come here, Henry. How about some aloe? I said this as normally as possible, wanting to show him that what he had just witnessed had not been my true self. He shook his head, disappearing behind the door. I left the door open for the rest of the bath, making a point to be extra gentle with Kian so that Henry would be able to hear me. But from that point onward Kian played mildly, no longer disobeying me, which was what I had wanted, but I wasn’t happy. The incident had drained the only remaining hopeful part of my heart, sorrow already rushing in to fill its place.
    
     
    
    By the time I left, it was deep into night. Seeing the train cross over the bridge had the effect of making the journey feel longer than it was, and by the time I walked up my five flights of stairs, my head pulsed as though it were being squeezed lightly like a grape. I was surprised to see the lights still on in the kitchen, and more streaming out from Emily’s room. I was transported to days of returning home at dawn when she would be waiting – her eyes fixed in anticipation for me to dismiss whomever I had just spent the night with. I shook off my shoes, and when the floorboards creaked, Emily appeared in her nightgown, so big on her that it made her face look small and sweet. Can we talk? She asked, and when we sat down at the edge of her bed, she composed a face laden with meaning. She said, I’m not continuing our lease. The words drifted like fall leaves. What? I said. Jacob asked me to move in. Jacob? You’ve barely dated. It’s been almost a year; eleven months on the thirteenth. I frowned at that, and she frowned at me. After a silence a smile broke out on her face, and only because she could not help herself did it move me.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    The last days of our lease together ended. I helped her stack items into one box after another, taped them. It was warm on the day she left. The sky was lighter, the streets teeming, summer just beginning. I had found a PhD student to take her room, but before she moved in I had the apartment to myself for a couple weeks. I kept her door closed and pretended Emily was still there – that I could hear the muffled sounds of her typing on a keyboard, but after four days I gave in. I moved through her room hesitantly, my bare feet hardly picking up a single mote of dust. She had hired a cleaner to scrub the room, and once finished, all the debris cleared away, all that energy expended, I felt betrayed that the task had not been left to me; now that she had more money she could afford to be sanitary in her relationships, to incur no grievances which had exasperated me at times but made me soft for her. Many nights, I sat in a corner of the empty room simply missing her.
    
     
    
    The internship started in June. Every day was the same. I sorted mail, opening packages, but not anything that looked remotely personal. I shredded paper and emptied the trash. I set the table for lunch, ran the dishwasher. I answered the buzzer and welcomed guests, holding the door open and asking how they liked to take their coffee. Noa, my boss’s assistant, seemed apologetic when giving me these tasks, and would not have believed that I enjoyed their domesticity because I couldn’t repress that side of me.
    
     
    
    It was still light when I returned home. Most days I fixed up a simple meal, but sometimes I ate with a friend, and sometimes there was laughter. If I was in the mood, I set out on a walk. I took the same route, making deliberate turns to pass the apartments friends had once lived in, parcels of the past that now felt very distant. The sidewalks dipped and lengthened as I approached the highway, where the whoosh of vehicles compounded into a stream of white noise, which I imagined as an analgesic fog one must pass through to reach the other side, the pier. I liked leaning against the railing at the furthest point out, where the misty breeze lifted off the surface of the water and wafted up toward me. I stared out at the lit-up Jersey skyline, my eyes sometimes following a boat coursing through the waters. Some nights a tango class took place under the white tent where pairs of young and old people danced, circling other pairs who had their arms around each other, and watching this made me happy. I returned home by sunset and went to sleep, waking up as the sky turned light. It was miraculous what sleep could do. In the morning, no problem seemed too big or permanent. I lay awake, registering my thoughts and the objects in my room which looked edgeless and indeterminate without my contacts. I washed the grime off my face with cold water and poked around the kitchenette, where I no longer had to be careful about closing a cupboard too loudly, though sometimes I still was as a silent act of love."

    "text": "The culture of hedonism and the exaltation of entertainment was at its peak a few hundred years ago, when Melaka was under the rule of Sultan Mansur Shah.

    The prosperity of Melaka cannot be described in words or written in ink. The Sultan’s luxurious riches exceeded those of all the European rulers at that time, when the Malay language was far more influential than English. It was the language of trade and economy of the Southeast regions, to the extent that anyone who did not know Malay was assumed to be a fool. The zawiyah religious schools all over Asia taught subjects like mathematics and science in Malay, because no other language had succeeded in becoming a medium of knowledge. English was only spoken by a few tribes in the island of Wales, who were obviously poor, undeveloped and completely dependent on the courage and benevolence of Robin Hood.
    
    To attract visitors to Melaka, Sultan Mansur Shah suggested a Malay singing competition should be held, focused specifically on the performance of dondang sayang – very delicate and highly artistic songs. The purpose of that intelligent Sultan’s was none other than to further propagate Malay as the language of arts and culture, and enshrine its status of lingua franca.
    
    Accordingly, the merdangga was beaten by drummers in every village to invite young singers with dulcet voices who were eligible to be the royal biduanita.
    
    The story is told that news of the competition reached the daughter of a warrior from the interior region. Miss Siti Mustika was her name, and she was well-known among the local folk for her pleasant singing at wedding ceremonies. She had a great desire to take part in the competition. The mother of Miss Siti Mustika had herself been a traditional folk singer, ever since the time of Parameswara.
    
    On the day of the competition, people arrived in droves to see who would become the palace biduanita, and be blessed with honour, all manner of awards, and expensive presents.
    
    By the final stage of the contest, there were ten biduanita candidates who sang songs to the keroncong, zapin, samrah, joget and various other rhythms which have vanished today. Miss Siti Mustika chose to sing to the rhythm of the zapin, which caused everyone to jiggle their bodies, move their shoulders, shake their heads and raise their hips. From the moment Miss Siti Mustika began to sing, all the other candidates were stunned and greatly embarrassed. Her voice was as dulcet as the wind, as the daybreak, as the dawn, as the evening, as the twilight, and as the night.
    
    The melodiousness of Miss Siti Mustika’s voice was such that the flies ceased to buzz and mosquitoes to whirr. All wild animals stopped their chattering. Her voice, though, was not equal to that of David, Prophet of Allah, which could stop a river from flowing, and cause falling water to halt in the air even as it plunged to the ground. Sultan Mansur Shah himself was awed by the mellow voice of this pure jewel, and the queen blushed with delight at the excellence of Miss Siti Mustika’s voice.
    
    That was the beginning of Miss Siti Mustika’s career, which was legendary and historic: her voice was the talk of people from Taipeh to Tiongkok, from Japan to Java to Sumatera and every corner of Asia. To sing, to sing, and to sing was the only duty of the beautiful Miss Siti Mustika, who enchanted many people across the world and, whose talent was unmatched.
    
    For four consecutive years, Miss Siti Mustika was pronounced Queen of the Fine Art of Voice, and all manner of awards were bestowed on her during the full moon of every season. If Miss Siti Mustika sang a song of anguish and sorrow, all who heard it would indeed shed tears at the soul in her unsurpassable singing. If Miss Siti Mustika sang in a spirited way all who heard would indeed sprain and strain every joint as they danced. And what was more, Miss Siti Mustika was capable of changing the tune of songs by ear, such that she could shift the very beat and could render anything melodious. But her most impressive quality was her humility, her courtesy and her cultured speech, she who never forgot where she had come from, even after she had become wealthy with the abundant luxuries the palace lavished upon her.
    
    Nevertheless, typical of the manner of the Malay, who are full of jealousy and envy, incredible yarns were spun about Miss Siti Mustika. It was said that she was a Hindu, and had practised asceticism at the mausoleums of Borobodur, and that to acquire her exceptional and melodious voice, she had killed 999 boys who had just reached puberty, one week after their first wet dream. Pure, untainted and virtuous, Miss Siti Mustika valiantly faced all the slander and defamation by the jealous royal handmaids, and continued only with her singing, avoiding idle talk and ignoring all the malicious rumours, distortions, tricks and deceit, the wild, baseless gossip. She declared through the royal spokesman that, ‘It is not good to slander, for fear of entering into hell.’
    
    Sultan Mansur Shah himself was incensed and enraged by the indecent statements and issued an edict, ‘This is the way of the Malay, when there is anyone who is a little better, never would they wish to help but instead would wish to bring about their downfall.’
    
    It was then that Miss Siti Mustika’s greatness and abilities in singing the ghazal, keroncong, dondang sayang, samrah and zapin reached the ears of a Hindu King in Borneo Island, who believed that his biduanita, Dang Hitam (Lady Black) was more wonderful and more energetic in her singing. He wished to stage a singing competition, which would be honest, fair and judged by experts, and held in some place outside of Melaka, in order to establish who was really the most outstanding singer of Nusantara.
    
    The singing contest had to be performed in Malay, because it was the only language of knowledge, of art and of competition, even though a time would come when this same Malay language would become no more than a language of trade in its own country.
    
    A plan was arranged to enable Dang Hitam and Miss Siti Mustika to compete. It was agreed that Temasik Island would be the venue for this prestigious event. The people of Meleka, who favoured the fair-skinned, observed that Dang Hitam was actually not dark-skinned and was, in fact, quite lovely, ith a slender body, round sparkling eyes, curly hair and magnificent teeth. She had been a sentinel of the mines before her talent had been spotted in a singing and dancing competition in the south of Borneo Island. At first Dang Hitam had been light-skinned, with a pinkish complexion but after years of manual work in paddy barns, sheds and granaries her skin darkened. Dang Hitam could still be considered beautiful though, because, as even white people say, beauty is a subjective matter. In the eyes of the people of Meleka there was only one deficiency in Dang Hitam: she loved to keep her toenails extremely long, sometimes even up to eight inches. Unknown to the people of Melaka, was that this was the secret of her miraculous voice, a voice so famed for its high quality and huskiness, that this placed her as the nearest challenger to Miss Siti Mustika.
    
    The two greatest biduanita of Nusantara arrived on Temasik Island with their ardent followers. Dang Hitam had trained her vocals relentlessly to guarantee she became the champion. She even made a statement, ‘I will win to ensure that I can spread the wings of my talent.’
    
    When Miss Siti Mustika was asked about the competition she only said ‘I do not mind who wins this competition. Let’s see who the lucky one is. The important thing is to propagate the Malay language.’
    
    Five professional jury members were invited to judge. They were Madame Celine from France, Ibu Dayanti from Java, Sayidah Baskal from the Middle East, Ah Mei from Tiongkok and they were led by the only male jury member, Syed Ali Diab, specially invited from Ottoman Egypt.
    
    Thousands of people came to listen on the day of the competition, and this made for a lively atmosphere, but as soon the singers ascended onto the stage everyone became so silent that even if someone’s teeth were to chatter it would surely have been heard.
    
    The host began his speech, ‘This competition is only to delight and please, so please don’t take to heart whatever the results may be. Our true purpose is to propagate the Malay language through song. May this language be treated with dignity forever and its capacity never be disputed.’ The audience applauded. After that, both singers played a game of the ozom to determine who would sing first. It determined Dang Hitam would be the one to start.
    
    Dang Hitam sang three songs, two with vivacious beats which displayed her ability to sing loudly in a shrill voice at a high pitch, and for the qualities of her husky voice she received thunderous applause. The other song was a ballad. Dang Hitam sang with complete seriousness and solemnity. Once again the audience gave enormous applause.
    
    When the time came for Miss Siti Mustika, everyone again fell silent. Miss Siti sang three songs, two that were slow and resonant and one that was fiery. As she sang, a rainbow radiated from sky to earth, even though there had been no rain beforehand. Everyone in the audience cheered, and then was rendered completely speechless by Miss Siti Mustika’s voice.
    
    The members of the jury found it difficult to decide who should be the champion. Their discussions lasted for several days and nights.
    
    They found Miss Siti Mustika’s voice to be correct and precise. Even though Dang Hitam’s vocals were huskier, the steadiness of Miss Siti Mustika’s voice could not be contested. Miss Siti possessed a wide vocal range which could be exploited such that she could sing now in a low pitch and now, unexpectedly, in a high trill, something that Dang Hitam could not do. In addition, Miss Siti Mustika’s pronunciation was very clear and whether a song was lively or sad, she controlled her voice perfectly. There were some singers who sounded as if their voices were lilting when they sang sad songs, but when they were told to sing fast, upbeat songs, ended up breathless.
    
    Lastly, they considered Miss Siti Mustika to be sincere in her rendition. Her emotions surged out as she sang, whereas Dang Hitam sang dutifully without conveying her feelings; whether she felt happiness as she sang was unknown, whether it was sorrow, unknown, whether it was hate, or mopishness, or whatever – all unknown.
    
    The judges came to the decision that Miss Siti Mustika should be the champion.
    
    Dang Hitam was very disappointed and pulled a face as sour as a mango left to rot over two full moons. Dang Hitam’s ardent followers were very angry with Miss Siti Mustika’s victory and resorted to rioting for seven days and seven nights across Temasik Island. They continued to protest and demonstrate every Saturday evening, but Miss Siti Mustika remained calm and prayed in gratitude to God, and was thankful to the jury for believing in her talent. Miss Siti Mustika’s followers continued to increase.
    
    That is the story of Miss Siti Mustika, legendary biduanita of the age of the Malay Melaka Sultanate, who was so highly renowned. She was taken to China, to Japan, to Java, and to Europe to sing. Miss Siti Mustika never forgot where she was from. She constantly let it be known that her duty as an artist was to propagate her mother tongue and is still quoted for saying ‘The Malay language will never vanish from the world’."

    "text": "When I got home I set my purse and a bag of Vidalia onions down on the counter. Then I took off my Chanel flats. I’d paid too much for them and they pinched my feet, particularly after walking many city blocks, as I had that day. I wasn’t alone in the apartment. The lights were all on. Plus, the television hadn’t been turned off. Then I heard footsteps coming from the next room and they were my husband’s. He came up behind me and put his large hands on my shoulders and guided me to the armchair. Then he bent down and kissed me on the crown of my head and asked me what I’d done that day. We had been having some marital problems, despite having been married for only eight months. The wedding had been a big ceremony in Newport, Rhode Island, and throughout it I remembered feeling like an imposter, like I’d somehow snuck in. Just after the wedding, I told my mother that I didn’t think I was cut out to be a wife and she explained that women who believe themselves too unconventional for marriage are only flattering themselves with ideas about their own peculiarity when in truth they’re just as boring as everyone else. The therapist we started seeing for forty-five minutes once a week suggested we try to foster a sense of connection in our marriage by asking one another each evening: what did you do today? And then answering honestly.

    We had managed, for the previous three weeks, to pose the question, but I never could tell if he was answering honestly. I myself often answered vaguely, and more than once I had lied about who I’d seen or how much money I’d spent, so I could only assume he was lying too. My husband wasn’t a stupid man. He was capable of secrecy and evasion too, and adept at getting what he wanted by omitting the things that might make the other person unhappy. That was why I had married him, because he was my equal. But I was beginning to understand that equality wasn’t enough. In any case, considering the day I’d had, I felt I shouldn’t lie because what my lies obscured for a short time would invariably come to the surface later in more disruptive ways – ways that made it difficult to be a wife and a person.
    
     
    
    ‘Sit down,’ I told him. He sat and turned off the television which had been playing a commercial for diabetes medication. I began to explain what had happened to me that afternoon, starting with the fact that I’d gone very far Uptown for a sandwich. I was eating my hero in the park by the river, I told him, and drinking a Coke, when a woman walked up to me. The woman was wearing large sunglasses which covered most of her face. She looked a bit haggard, sort of eccentric, and she stood so close to me that I thought she might become violent. Not being able to see her eyes made it hard to understand what she was after. I didn’t know what she wanted: food, or money, or my purse. So I offered her half of my sandwich. She said that she wasn’t hungry and took off her glasses. She had very dark green eyes and I saw that she was really beautiful with her face uncovered. I thought then, she’s probably just an artist and she looks disheveled on purpose. The woman sat down on the bench next to me and the afternoon sun caught her face in the most arresting way. It was all a bit dramatic, I told my husband, and I was pretty turned on. He nodded. Our therapist had told us to validate each other’s honest answers, even when they made us uncomfortable. That was how trust was built.
    
    Then, I said, the woman leaned over and outstretched her hand.
    
    ‘Can I touch you please?’ she asked. I nodded. She put her hand on my face. Her palm was coarse. She held my cheek in her left hand, and then brought her right hand up to my face as well. Her expression betrayed real sadness, but it couldn’t have had anything to do with me since I had just met the woman, I told my husband.
    
    ‘You look just like my daughter-in-law,’ she said. ‘I thought I’d seen a ghost. I come out here walking each morning. My apartment is just up there.’
    
    She pointed up at Riverside Drive. I looked in that direction and nodded. Then we looked ahead silently as joggers and dog-walkers passed us by.
    
    ‘My son’s wife, Sarah. She was so bright. So pretty. Had everything going for her. Then she killed herself. I never understood why.’
    
    I told her that was terrible and put my hand on her knee to comfort her. Any sexual feeling I had was gone. The woman told me her name and asked me to join her upstairs for a cup of tea; she wanted to look at me a bit longer. For whatever reason I agreed. I put the remainder of the sandwich in my purse and walked with her up the sloping path, out of the park and into the street.
    
    ‘I won’t keep you long,’ the woman said. ‘Are you on your lunch break?’
    
    ‘No,’ I told her. ‘I’m between jobs. I used to work as a reporter.’
    
    ‘Sarah was a writer too. She wrote novels. She was editing the third one just before she died.’
    
    The woman told me she was sure I’d find more work soon since it was New York, and there were always opportunities for those who wanted them. If you were bright, attractive, took initiative and truly wanted to work, you could have anything you wanted in New York. That was why it was the greatest city in the world. Then she said her building was just up the next block. Once there, we got into an elevator lined with brass and rode up a few floors, where she let me into her kitchen which was full of masks and pieces of folk art she must have collected in Mexico and the American Southwest. She let down her hair and took down a photograph from the refrigerator and set it down in front of me. And as I looked at the picture – and I looked at it for a very long time – I truly believed I was looking at a photograph of myself. This dead woman, Sarah, looked more like me than my own mother, than my sister and cousins. Down to the way she wore her hair, we looked just alike.
    
    ‘Now you see what I mean,’ the woman said.
    
    ‘It’s unsettling,’ I told her.
    
    ‘It is, it is,’ she said and produced another picture from the fridge where Sarah looked even more like me than she did in the first. It was a wedding photo taken by the beach. Not unlike the New England beach where we were married, I told my husband. Sarah was smiling with her bridesmaids, all of whom wore black cocktail dresses and looked ahead, unaware of their futures. I didn’t tell the woman about my wedding; the other coincidences were enough. To share more would be pointless and cruel.
    
    The woman went into the next room and came back with a black garment bag. She set it down on the long dining table and unzipped it: an ivory dress with white rosettes embroidered along the neckline.
    
    ‘I designed this dress,’ she said. ‘I’m an artist. I make watercolors. The roses on the neckline, those were my idea.’
    
    ‘It’s beautiful,’ I said. I looked down at my watch. I should be going, I said. I had been with the woman for more than an hour. I wasn’t sure how it was possible – time was moving in such an odd way.
    
    ‘Will you put it on? I’m sure it’ll fit. You’re the same size as Sarah. The size Sarah was. Kill to be that small again,’ the woman said, pulling a veil out of its garment bag, smoothing it out in the mirror. ‘Go ahead, try it on.’
    
    ‘I couldn’t,’ I said. I thought that to try on that dress would have been too much, but I was so suggestible in that woman’s apartment, surrounded by photographs of her dead daughter-in-law. I stripped down to my panties and let the woman help me into the dress.
    
    She buttoned me up and placed a veil over my head. Then she looked at me with the expression prisoners sometimes have when they’ve just been released and can’t believe the world is still the world and they’re in it, or something. Do you know what I mean? I asked my husband. He said that he thought he understood, but I wasn’t sure if he did.
    
    I kept talking anyway. I told him that the woman had to hold on to the table for support, that she was shocked. At the same time she looked happy to see this doppelgänger in the old dress.
    
    ‘I kept all her clothes. My son can’t stand to have them in his apartment. Too traumatic, he says. But I don’t think remembering is traumatic,’ she said. ‘Must be a generational thing.’
    
    I looked at myself in the mirror in the hall. I could see the Hudson River through a window. I looked down at the river and up at myself in that wedding gown, back and forth, and thought I had better stop coming Uptown.
    
    I was startled when the woman came up behind me. I was even more surprised when she told me that she had texted her son, that he was a few minutes away.
    
    ‘He needs to see you for himself.’
    
    I didn’t think that it was a very good idea. But somehow, I told my husband, I felt that I was completely at this woman’s mercy. The idea of walking outside and getting on the M11 bus home without seeing it all through was unthinkable. I didn’t know if they were just grief- stricken, or just crazy, or what.
    
    ‘When did she die?’ I asked.
    
    ‘Two years next week,’ the woman said.
    
    Then, ‘She was like my own daughter.’
    
    ‘Must be a real loss,’ I said, staring down at the wedding band on my left hand.
    
    We sat for a while at the table drinking Chardonnay and waited for her son to arrive. I asked for some ice cubes for my wine and she said she would have some too. I wouldn’t ordinarily drink so early in the day; I found it impossible to stop once I started, but it would have been rude to refuse the woman’s generosity, I told my husband. I made a point to be explicit about this with him because he had been concerned that I had been drinking too heavily since I lost my job and because it was yet another thing I lied about, how much I drank. She moved to top up my glass and I told her I was alright. The doorbell rang and we both stood up. She pressed the buzzer, and some moments later a short man with dark hair appeared in the doorway. I noticed this only because I towered over him, as you tower over me, I told my husband. He was dressed in business casual and looked pretty sharp, though it wasn’t my style, or yours, I said. He didn’t seem alarmed by the scene – his mother drinking wine with a woman who looked just like his dead wife, but then he was a man who had likely found the lifeless body of his own spouse.
    
    He seemed neutral about all of it when he pulled up a chair at the head of the table beside us, and that made me feel at ease. He looked at me for a long while without saying anything, and then slipped onto the floor. I was worried that he had fainted. But he got up onto his knees, reached out, and began to kiss my hands. I didn’t pull away. I wanted him to have whatever little comfort I could give him – what did it matter? It wasn’t real. It was just a fantasy. A fantasy I felt he deserved.
    
    ‘Mom, can I be alone with her for a moment?’ he asked.
    
    ‘It’s up to her,’ the woman said. I told them it was fine. The woman drank what was left of her wine and then said she was going out for a walk. She told me that if I got tired of wearing the dress, I should just take it off and put it on her bed. Her son could show me where the bedroom was. The door shut behind her and we were alone. I asked him to get off the floor. Sitting across from him again, I asked him his name and he said that it was Matthew. I told him a bit about my life, how I lost my job, where I grew up. I was candid about our marriage, I hope that’s alright, I told my husband. My husband said that it was fine.
    
    ‘Sarah and I had a very difficult marriage too,’ Matthew said. ‘She was a deeply unhappy person. And I always thought that it was because she was a writer and writers were temperamental, that maybe she would mellow out with age, but she never did.’
    
    ‘Are you a writer too?’ I asked.
    
    ‘No,’ he said, ‘I teach engineering at Columbia.’
    
    ‘Do you enjoy the work you do?’
    
    ‘No,’ he said, ‘I grew tired of it years ago. The students are the worst part, though my colleagues are awful too.’
    
    He helped himself to the wine on the table.
    
    ‘On the night of our wedding she confessed there was someone else, had been for two years, a lover Upstate. She didn’t even know how to drive, I don’t know how she managed it.’
    
    ‘Trains,’ I said. ‘Why didn’t you annul the marriage?’
    
    ‘Probably for the same reasons you don’t divorce your husband,’ he said. He explained that he had loved her a lot, hadn’t wanted to change her nature, which he had understood as soon as he’d met her and continued to understand up until the day she died. He asked me to take off the dress. He said he couldn’t stand to look at it anymore. I couldn’t unfasten the buttons on my own and I asked him to help me.
    
    ‘It isn’t just the way you look,’ he said, standing behind me. ‘It’s your mannerisms too. The way you talk. It’s surprising you haven’t run into anyone else in the city who knew her.’
    
    ‘Well, I don’t really come Uptown unless I want a sandwich,’ I said. I covered my breasts with one hand and asked him where his mother’s bedroom was. I placed the dress back in the garment bag and followed him down the hall and set it on her bed. We stood at the foot of the bed and when he asked me to lie down, my initial thought was to say no out of loyalty to you, I told my husband, but when I thought about it, I realized it wouldn’t be a violation of anything – it wasn’t real, only a consolation. And, I asked my husband, how often do these things happen?
    
    I agreed and sat down on the bed. He pulled down my stockings and put his right hand between my legs. Then he continued to do the things he presumably used to do with his wife. He didn’t ask for my input. He seemed to be following a progression that had little to do with me in particular. And despite that, or maybe because of that, I had an orgasm even though, as you know, I told my husband, it’s been very hard for me to finish since I lost my job. When he came, he cried, which felt appropriate. I mean, who knew what was appropriate in a situation like that? We held one another in his mother’s bed, and he stroked my forehead with the back of his hand and asked if it would be alright to spit in my mouth, Sarah had always liked it and asked for it. I told him it was fine.
    
    ‘Can I see you again?’ he asked afterward.
    
    ‘I’ll have to ask my husband,’ I told him, ‘ And of course we’ll have to mention it to our marriage counselor.’
    
    He told me he understood, but that should I change my mind I could find his name on the faculty directory for Columbia University’s Engineering Department. Then he told me that when he looked at me he felt glad, that it wasn’t logical but it made him feel like there were many Sarahs in the world and that some of them had survived, were surviving. He hugged me. There wasn’t anything sensual about it. It felt like pure gratitude. Like the time we took LSD together in school, I told my husband, and we kept saying we felt one hundred percent thankful to be alive. My husband didn’t say anything, but I knew he remembered.
    
    Then Matthew got up and dressed himself. Back in his plain shirt and pants, he went into the next room and came back with the clothes I’d been wearing. I put them all back on. I slipped into my uncomfortable shoes and headed toward the door. When I kissed Matthew goodbye, he handed me a photograph of Sarah. He kept several in his wallet and wanted me to have the one where he felt I looked especially like her. The one where she was wearing black and sitting in a park, just as I had done earlier that day. Outside, I saw Matthew’s mother walking up the stone steps a little ways ahead. Her head was bowed and she didn’t see me. I went in the other direction toward the grocery store crowded with people just getting off work. I bought a bag of Vidalia onions and stood in line with all of the other living people who needed whatever they needed. They all seemed to wait with impatience, but I was glad the line moved slowly because I wasn’t yet ready to go home and resume my ordinary life. Holding the onions, I sat down at the student bar on the corner and drank one beer, then another. I burped as I watched undergrads flirt badly, binge drink and make out with one another and I was relieved to see this because all the articles I had read lately insisted young people weren’t sleeping with one another anymore. Risk and lust are not over, I thought, as I stumbled to the bus stop. I boarded the M11 and stood up front, as close as the bus driver would let me. I watched the bright road up ahead punctuated by the wipers moving across the glass, slowly pushing away the spring rain. I came to our street and saw that the lights were on and I was glad because I knew I’d see you and could tell you what had happened to me, I told my husband.
    
    When I stopped speaking, he stood up and paced the length of the living room many times. He held his face in his hand and opened his mouth as if he might speak, but didn’t say anything at all. Because I thought it might clarify things and might explain the inevitability of what had happened, I handed him the photograph I’d been given. He folded it once, then again without seeming to look at it. When he left the room and shut the door behind him, I sat for a long while in the armchair without feeling any remorse."

    "text": "My parents watch television out of tiredness, to fill the void. Sometimes separately: my mother in the morning, busying herself in the kitchen with all the breathlessness of her ninety-six kilos; my father late at night, his ankles resting on a second chair. Without shoes or socks, head thrown back and mouth half open, he wakes with a start, follows the program for ten minutes and then sinks back into an unhealthy drowsiness. One can’t help but note the necrosis in his halluces – he’s starting to die toes first.

    The intelligence they were endowed with has festered from lack of material on which to apply itself, and has taken different paths in each of them. In my father, it has created a flat-out ‘early-bird’ frenzy: at first, seeing as for work he had to go see clients at lunchtime, he merely moved the meal up from one to noon, and my mother adapted; then, progressively and imperceptibly, he expected to eat at eleven, at ten, at nine thirty. Now, when I’m visiting them and get up to go to the kitchen around nine, I find him in front of a plate of rigatoni with sauce, which he asks me if I want to try. As a result, dinner is at four thirty or five, and after that it’s television until two in the morning. At this point he hardly sleeps anymore, he gets up at six and the cycle starts over. He says he does everything so early to ‘take it off his mind.’
    
    My mother’s putrefied intelligence has mostly taken a path of refusal: the women in the building that go to play bingo are ‘old nitwits’; in the shopping malls where my father wants to take her ‘there’s nothing to see’; those who are looking to have funerals in church ‘want to dupe even Our Lord’. She’d like to be thrown away in a trash bag, so as not to be a nuisance and not make anyone pay for anything. Latched on to her rancor like a castaway to a raft: ‘you’ve put on weight once again,’ she says when I turn to present a gift to my sister, a piece of Afghan jewelry that ‘will break her neck.’ Everything is dirty or sick, the cat that hops up and down the stairs has mange, there’s no such thing as corresponding opinions (‘if I say orange, you say apple’).
    
    Often she watches the television without seeing it, confuses the characters in the soaps and asks for information five minutes after it’s been given on the newscast; with the excuse that ‘they’re all practically naked,’ she attributes one showgirl’s love affairs to another, to Manuela Arcuri the calendar with pictures of Alena Šeredová. The programs she follows more attentively are ones rife with disdain, where people are humiliated and made to look bad. She particularly likes the talent show La corrida, guffaws when the audience bang pans and blare horns to boo contestants off the stage. But Sarabanda – Name That Tune works for her too, especially since the host Papi started getting nasty with the contestants (monomaniacs or idiots savants, generally), making them dress like buffoons.
    
    These are the programs my parents watch together early in the evening during prime time, in addition to infomercials on the local channels and comedy competitions. The vulgarity they go searching for is that of the evening gatherings in the courtyard from when they were young (but they’re left partially dissatisfied – here, natural and plump salaciousness is missing, everything is fabricated and induced). It’s no coincidence that their choices are the opposite of mine: they’re not looking for an immaterial reality or a hyperreality, they’re looking for the reality that once was – that obsolete, raw reality which they no longer have. My parents almost never use the remote; once they’ve landed on a channel they stay there for the whole evening. They watch medical programs like Elisir to save on doctors; my father explains the medical terms to my mother (pretending to be an ignoramus is an old gag of hers, with frequent references to my sister and my university degrees: ‘I’m the only dunce left in this house’); out of gratitude, she repays him by not huffing throughout the never-ending hours of soccer. They’ve understood that fighting prolongs conversation. The other day, he wrote down notes to call in live on Telecanarino, a Modenese soccer channel; he got off to a fluid start, then he tripped up: ‘. . . Brazil won five World Cups, but that was because they had guys like Didi passing the ball – they even won that year Pelé was injured, with Garrincha, Vavá and . . . what’s his name . . . the one that substituted Pelé . . . dammit, I don’t remember . . . you’ll have to forgive me . . .’ They were very understanding on screen, but when he hung up he took it out on my mother for having mixed up his pages of notes – she denied it and thus they at least spent an hour out of the ordinary.
    
    At the age of eighty-two and eighty, they don’t use the television as a form of escape, but to stay tenaciously gripped on to life as it slips away. They resemble me in only one thing: their strategy for serenity, rather than multiplying pleasures, is generally to negate displeasures (but the last of all will get the better of them: death). Perhaps there’s an Emilian way to Buddhism. In any event, our familial microclimate is hardly suited for passion.

    Since going to the movies seems unthinkable to them (and for my mother, of course, getting there would be complicated), I gave them a VHS player as a gift, so they could at least get some old films with Nazzari or Yvonne Sanson, and decide what to watch for themselves rather than always being towed along. They didn’t use it even once, not out of laziness or an uneasiness with anything new, but as a moral stance: ‘we’re not so demanding.’ They accept programs the way one accepts hospital food.
    
    Theirs is a sense of guilt, distorted and turned accusatory: we weren’t able to give wealth to our children, we weren’t even able to become comfortable like our siblings and brothers- and sisters-in-law (with home ownership, at least, plus private retirement funds) – therefore the wasteful world, the world that in the meantime seduced our children and pulled them away from us, disgusts us. I don’t know how else to explain the stubbornness with which they, by mutual agreement, reject the high-quality food I bring over; I can no longer take seeing them eat only hard discount-store tuna, in giant cans with simply ‘tuna’ written on them, or blocks of Swiss cheese that resemble Styrofoam and last over fifteen days at home without developing mold. And so, in Modena’s chic delicatessens, Fini or Giusti, I buy creamy gorgonzola (which I know they like) or I stop at a butcher in the center of town to pick up a tenderloin, or have a basket of seasonal fruits prepared with Vignola cherries and plums and loquats. She says the loquats are bitter and ‘brusque’ (a Modenese way of saying ‘sour’), the tenderloin grosses her out because you can still see the blood, those three-for-one chicken breasts are much better. If I contradict them, they dig in their heels. The gorgonzola is good, sure, but you can’t compare it to the one a farmwoman used to make whose parents were from Pavia, and they ostentatiously let it dry in the fridge too, at least until I leave. ‘You eat them,’ they say of the plums, ‘you bought them for yourself,’ even if there are tons of them, and the two of them stick to the apples sold in bulk which they heap on a tray in their bedroom. Then they give in to harrowing spells of gluttony, chocolate that looks made from sawdust and two-kilo jars of ‘Norwegian’ (sic) peanuts.
    
    I know what they’d like from me, love and not food, but I haven’t been able to give them that for some time now; I’m telling you I’m mediocre. My reconsiderations would have to start from too far back, reopening old wounds that had been stitched shut with twine and healed shoddily, at best. Last week, while I was staying with them, I made a carbonara (which they obviously didn’t eat, loyal to the pseudo-Bolognese sauce that my father even brings in a jar to restaurants, where he asks them to serve him plain pasta), and, following tradition, I only used the egg yolk. Instinctively, I poured the egg whites down the sink and washed the glass; after a minute and a half, I turned around to find my mother crying, and when she saw my surprised expression she shouted ‘I could have eaten it with a little salt.’ She felt I had rejected her whole way of life, her eternal unhappy devotion.

    On the rare occasion they have people over, they now cook on the cheap; five cutlets to feed six, and a little mound of puree that would maybe feed four. Naturally, their guests keep their mouth shut and swear they’re not hungry, so much so that there’s still some food at the end, and my parents say ‘you see, you’re afraid it’s going to be too little to eat and then there’s always some left over.’ Even away from home, at my place, they don’t change their schedule in the slightest: Sergio, who as a Roman can’t conceive of eating lunch before one thirty, gets left at the table alone (in other words, with me, but never with them). They treat him as if he’s transparent. Probably, they suspect he ‘eats up my money’ but they don’t dare bring up the taboo topic, and so they stick simply to hello and goodnight, as if he were a lodger and I the owner of a boardinghouse. The fact that he loves me, or that I love him doesn’t concern them. It’s distressing that I am still able to squeeze out hate; they’re no good, and if they’re no good I don’t see why I should have to love them simply because they’re my parents.
    
    I hate the cookie dust they lick up after pouring it into their palms, because nothing gets thrown away, and the ten-year-old Easter egg wrapping folded and tucked away in a drawer, and the closet doorhandle held together with duct tape, the brown kind used for packages; I hate the smell of the towels in the bathroom, which to me seems to be the smell of piss, but is actually the smell of a poor home, of low-end detergent. The only topic of conversation with my father, for a long time now, has been how much things cost, his ‘deals’ at the Coop supermarket; he rattles off a series of numbers that I don’t follow and don’t understand, or meticulous calculations for shaving some small change off his share for the stairwell light in the building. That I don’t know the price of things appalls him but, in a way that I’m unable to explain, makes him proud too: ‘oh, your son travels in first class,’ he declared to my mother the time he came to pick me up at the station, and she, maintaining the same ambiguity, added, to me, ‘it’s good that you treat yourself like a gentleman.’
    
    My compulsion for semi-luxury is a reaction to my parents’ poverty, and most of all to their resignation. I discover this in certain excesses of mine, as stupid as they are grotesque, like eating only the small layer of cream in the center of a cake and then throwing out the rest. In the end, I apply the same evasive aesthetic when watching television.
    
    My mother’s pension is one million fifty thousand lire a month; my father’s (who was a traveling salesman and for many years didn’t pay the ‘the insurance stamps’, other than the so-called ‘voluntary’ ones towards the end of his career) is eight hundred twelve thousand. (The fact that she earns more prompts snide remarks and bickering to this day.) Just under two million lire a month for the two of them; with the new rent laws, they pay roughly six hundred thousand in rent, which leaves them with a million and three hundred thousand lire1 to live off. I feign ignorance, refusing to imagine the exact sacrifices they have to make, day after day – I’ve never tried to draw up a simple balance of earnings and expenditures. I merely send them, at the beginning of each month, an order of three hundred thousand lire and I feel I’ve done my bit. Our two economies stay starkly separated; I don’t base the amount on their needs and on what would make a dignified life for them, but on what feels like an appropriate amount for me to give. My conscience unburdened after sending the money order at the post office, I’m left with enough to treat myself to a lunch at Casa Vissani in Baschi or at Don Alfonso in Sant’Agata sui due Golfi, and maybe to a Missoni sweater. What my father calls ‘a helping hand’ is really the imposition of an imbalance between us.
    
    I know they give a part of their extremely meager income to my sister, who’s been on her own with my nephew since her husband left, preferring Brazil to her. Last year on Christmas night we were at a party and I wanted my sister to take me home. While looking for her, I went into the room where the guests’ coats were piled up and I caught her in the middle of some strange trade with a friend – she felt guilty, must have rapidly calculated that it was too late to deny it and threw herself into the mouth of truth, forcing a facetious tone. She was selling her friend the gold chain our grandmother had left her, the long art deco chain which could be wrapped around one’s neck a full three times and which was the only thing of any value in the family. ‘We’re at the souk,’ she said with an embarrassed and aggressive smile, and her generous friend added ‘yes, only the bargaining is more Mongol than Arab: I try to give her an amount and she lowers it.’ Then I remembered certain comments of my mother’s, about her twenty-year-old grandson who plays sports and needs to eat meat at least three times a week. I play at being a little nabob and my sister is barely managing to survive. I wrote her a check and with her, too, it was like I had signed for a divorce.

    You’ll wonder how, in this situation, I could speak of serenity. I want to tell you a story I heard from a taxi driver’s widow, one night when she’d been drinking, not long after I’d moved here to Borgata Fidene.
    
     
    
    story of the taxi driver’s wife
    
    She randomly gets in a 3570 taxi and, just to start a conversation, asks: ‘excuse me, do you know Antonio Detti?’ ‘Oh lady, do I know him, we’re good friends; the other day we went to that place dal Toscano with my wife and his, but it was a bust, the meat stunk like a corpse and we paid eight thousand lire a head – hey, if you’re gonna rip me off at least be lowkey about it . . .’ One question after another, he talks about her husband, it’s clearly not a case of a mistaken identity. But he talks about another wife, about other children and another home (‘I don’t remember exactly now, but it was around Ponte Bianco’). She thought that taxi driver was crazy, but in the ten years since – her husband recently died –  she’s never had the courage to ask for an explanation, to check with the 3570 taxi company, or to start an investigation. Only occasional walks around Ponte Bianco. ‘Anyways, if I knew, what would I have done about it?’
    
     
    
    I’ve adopted a similar tactic. Moreover, setting aside superficial variables, the economic framework of my soul continues to be the same as that of my parents. Besides a few swanky hotels, a few exhibitions in the Hague or Bilbao, maybe one of the things I’ve done the most frequently in my life has been to look down from the balcony railing into a deserted courtyard, on summer nights, with only an undershirt on – my stomach pushed up against the iron, like my father, like my mother; walled in by our social extraction, without any real escape on offer.
    
     
    
    —
    
     
    
    And then, in spite of everything, my parents are two serene old people. Because their conscience is clear: my father has never done anything dishonest and my mother, who’s tougher, thinks that this is why he’s stayed poor and looks down on him for it, but she can’t help showing solidarity. They’ve known each other since she was sixteen and he eighteen. My mother said to me one day ‘you know, from when I still went to the movies, and even today on the television, I’ve seen tons of handsome men, but a man who was completely handsome like your father – now that I’ve never seen.’ He still brings her chocolates, flowers, surprises her with things; for their fiftieth wedding anniversary he managed to track down the tree he’d photographed her in front of as a twenty-four year old, and then photographed her as a seventy-four year old in the same pose, but with two beachballs tied to her arms (the caption reads: ‘I married a woman with balls like these’).
    
    For them, social resignation is the child of some satisfaction in bed – purely out of luck, and, deep down, a little craven too insofar as it’s never analyzed or really put to the test, but it’s satisfaction and happiness all the same. In the past, I even envied them. When my father snores, it never even crosses my mother’s mind to move to the other room, which has been empty since their children left. She stays awake and swears that the noise keeps her company.
    
    They never listened to the dark phantoms that fluttered about, or at least never followed them. Might I be learning their lesson? Be on my way to becoming, when I’ll reach eighty, cheap and hateful like them? My father asks how the broth is, she answers ‘try it and see if it needs salt’; he insists ‘aside from the salt, how does it taste?’ to which she replies ‘like it always does’. Then he explodes, curses: ‘God damn it, can a guy not know how the damn broth is today?’ Then they make up, as soon as the Pope looks out from the basilica: ‘and if the Pope has to piss?’
    
    Is this what it will be like with Sergio, too?"

    "text": "As Nance told it, it sounded like nothing.

    Heath was half listening from the back seat of the car. ‘Ancient history, though, right?’
    
    ‘No,’ said Nance. ‘No. This was only last week.’ Only last week, she had awoken in a cold sweat, alone. She had reached for her phone and found it charging on the nightstand as usual, but without a second phone next to it. ‘Is that normal? Heath? Was he like this in college?’
    
    ‘Nance,’ Don interrupted from the driver seat. ‘Are we really doing this again?’ He looked back at Heath in the rearview mirror. ‘She’s gonna tell the story as if I’m a monster.’
    
    ‘No,’ said Nance, ‘I’m gonna tell it as it happened, to me.’
    
    Heath looked down at his phone. Nothing new. The girl hadn’t posted or messaged him, so he couldn’t reply. He searched through his other threads. Maybe he’d left someone else hanging. Not really, or at least not recently. It would be hours before they got to the house.
    
    Nance had never once reached for Don in their bed and not found him there, she told Heath. ‘It was disconcerting.’ More than that. ‘Terrifying.’
    
    ‘Alright,’ said Don.
    
    She called him – he was always the last call on her phone, top of the list, easy. He didn’t answer. She tried again. She thought she might be dreaming. But in dreams, phones don’t work. Numbers are not names – they’re scrambled captchas or license plates, glitching or unmoving. No, it was not a dream, it was just nightmarish. She called fifteen times, texted, messaged on apps in case his phone was dead and he had access to someone else’s. Nothing.
    
    Now, thought Heath, would be a good time for Don to jump in to spare him the full rant – they were on this trip together, so the story would necessarily end happily. Don was focused on the road, although it was straight and uncrowded. Indecipherable crops rolled by, offering Heath no distraction. When he gazed out the window, he was revisited by a slight carsickness not experienced since childhood.
    
    Nance had got out of bed and put on shoes, she said. Still in a T-shirt and sweat shorts, because changing her clothes felt wrong, she had walked down the stairs and out the front door. Don’s car was gone. It was after three. She went back upstairs and opened the shutter to their shared closet, as if some gap in the row of clothes would clue her in to where he’d gone.
    
    Nance and Don must have made up within a few days of this argument, thought Heath. And then today, they’d loaded up the Explorer, driven downtown together and picked up Heath from the parking lot of his apartment building, overnight bag in hand, on their way to a weekend rental in the country.
    
    ‘Want to see me tomorrow?’ asked a text sent to Heath. The number wasn’t saved, but he scrolled up and recognized the conversation. ‘Out of town, but what about next week?’ He remembered how her hair felt. Every part of her was softer than the pads of his fingers, which now gripped the phone, a portal away from this couple and the couple they’d be meeting at the house, another friend from school and his new girlfriend. An ellipsis signaled typing. It disappeared.
    
    Minutes before, they had been laughing at the names of roadside diners and gossiping about the alcoholic boyfriend of a mutual friend. In fact, the discussion about the night Don went missing had only started because Heath had said something like, ‘I don’t think I’ve ever seen you two argue.’ He’d meant it as encouragement, not a provocation. Don had responded with something like, ‘Oh, you’d be surprised,’ and then, like the revving of an ignition, came the too-familiar buzz of bickering starting up. It was a noise Heath usually did everything in his power to avoid. This was why he was still single, his sister would say, to which he’d nod, pretending to understand.
    
    ‘Sure,’ said the text, which had taken a beat too long to arrive. Sure? He was somehow already disappointing her. ‘Forget it,’ he wanted to text back, but instead sent a cartoon face with a stupid smile. He was reminded of a sound she made, a moan inside of his mouth. He pulled up a selfie she’d posted with pleading eyes. ‘Sure,’ he could hear her sigh. The tiny photo trembled with the motion of the car.
    
    Don breathed through his nose so loudly it turned Nance’s head. ‘Nothing to say?’ she hissed.
    
    ‘But you got ahold of him in the end,’ Heath said to Nance.
    
    ‘No,’ Nance shook her head. ‘He just came home, after I’d fallen back asleep. I could’ve called around or filed a missing person’s report. Who doesn’t answer their phone?’
    
    ‘And where were you, Don?’ Heath asked, understanding his role as the child they didn’t have, the entertainment and the entertained. It was a game that had started before his arrival and would continue after his departure, but he couldn’t sit it out – the third wheel’s function in arguments was always pivotal. The landscape outside tilted into tall orchards, silhouetted leaves that caused the sunlight to glisten too quickly. Heath closed his eyes and still saw the pattern flashing through their lids. His stomach inched closer to his throat.
    
    ‘Where was I?’ Don repeated. Nance shrunk into her seat and stared ahead.
    
    ‘Why don’t you say where I was?’ said Don. ‘Go ahead.’
    
    ‘I went back to sleep,’ said Nance, quieter. ‘When I woke up, you were back. You never told me.’
    
    ‘I did, though,’ said Don. ‘I told you.’
    
    Heath could hear the strain of springs and opened his eyes. Nance had turned around and put her head between the driver’s and front passenger’s seats. Her expression was softer than he’d imagined. She blinked slowly. This was a very Nance blink, usually utilized for comic effect.
    
    ‘He was at his ex’s house,’ said Nance. ‘Don woke up in the middle of the night, didn’t tell me where he was going, got dressed and drove to another woman’s house, a woman who has kids—’
    
    ‘They were with their dad,’ said Don.
    
    ‘On a night she didn’t have her kids, because you know that. You know her fucking schedule and you understand, and she understands, that if you go over there in the middle of the night –’
    
    ‘She called me.’
    
    ‘Right, and it’s normal to call someone else’s man in the middle of the night –’
    
    ‘She has a history of mental instability.’
    
    ‘And she can’t call her own ex-husband or her own – whoever –’
    
    ‘She called me.’
    
    ‘Yeah, so Don was helping his ex –’
    
    ‘My friend.’
    
    ‘His friend. He was helping his friend. Someone he used to date.’
    
    ‘We never dated.’
    
    ‘Someone he used to fuck. Whatever. Right? He went all the way over there to talk her out of a suicide attempt, or I don’t know, was she trying to kill herself, or just having a panic attack?’
    
    Don’s silence curdled Nance’s question. She was not speaking correctly about psychological disorders, Heath gathered. Don was out saving someone. What difference did it make who it was? Everything became spiked with accusations once the initial excitement made room for domesticity: negotiating schedules, family visits on Christmas, groceries every Sunday. Inevitably someone forgot to get eggs, someone drank all the beer. This was one more misunderstanding, amid the many others.
    
    No one spoke for some time. Heath noticed that no music played, that it had been like this the whole trip. He wondered if Nance had fallen asleep.
    
    Don took them onto an exit, announcing the need for gas. They rolled up to a pump and with the tap of a large button the SUV turned off. Nance, very much awake, hopped out and crossed the lot to the convenience store with one arm wrapped around the strap of her purse, the other swaying. Heath followed her, hands in pockets, through the automatic doors. He stood outside a locked bathroom and watched as Nance stared at a display. She didn’t look up, but the forced serenity of her face told him she knew that Heath was there.
    
    They had first met at a sports bar downtown, what, six years ago? She was half the size of anyone in their group but took up more airspace altogether, darting from the bartender to her new boyfriend to his friends, showing a genuine interest in IPAs and football while meeting the gaze of each man, impressing upon everyone a brown-eyed mischief. At the end of the evening, she had held Don’s hand as they walked to his car, pulling his arm in the way of a child leaving a toy store, excited to go home but sad to leave.
    
    Watching them depart, Heath had – because he couldn’t help it – pictured Don and Nance having sex.
    
    Each following encounter was fortified by that first impression. Heath and Nance spoke at other games and other get-togethers until the initial frustration at her unavailability wore away, and she became his friend.
    
    Over the last six years, birthmarks and kitchen burns became noticeable. With familiarity, postures were loosened, necks were lined, and waists bloated. Heath wondered how she would appear to him from across a gas station mart if he’d never seen her before in his life – would she now be in the category of women who didn’t do it for him? Would he, if seeing her for the first time, in their current states, picture her naked? Maybe at that very moment she was wondering the same thing. She crossed her arms, which had gained a ruddiness behind the biceps. Her eyes were glassy and sullen, unimpressed by the selection.
    
    An industrial-strength flush sounded and the bathroom door opened. Heath turned to let a dust-blonde woman hand him the knob. He glanced backward before stepping in. Nance was holding a Cheetos bag with both hands, blocking her entire head. A life-sized Chester Cheetah face glared at Heath, sunglasses and smirking snout pointed in his direction. Nance twisted the bag from side to side like a sock puppet over a partition.
    
    Inside the Explorer, they returned to the standoff and sat listening to one another’s silence. Highway traffic thickened as clouds evaporated beneath a midday sun. Vehicles emptied into every lane. Don was, Heath noted, a smooth and confident driver. Had he always been? In college, cars were mostly used for going home to parents’ houses on laundry days or breaks. Don, the philosophy major, didn’t offer rides the way Matt would. Heath remembered that Matt, who would presently be joining them for the weekend, had driven a souped-up cherry-red truck in college, but he couldn’t picture the type of car Don had driven. That was something he could ask to break the ice.
    
    ‘Didn’t have a car,’ chirped Don, his voice falsely upbeat.
    
    ‘Hm,’ Heath said, trying again to smooth the tension. ‘I thought everyone had a car.’
    
    Nance had not been listening. She turned to Heath. ‘You probably know her,’ she said.
    
    This again. Yeah, if he thought about it, surely Heath would know of a woman Don had slept with, someone who now had kids and what sounded like a pill or alcohol problem. In fact, there were a few options. He would need some more clues to narrow it down.
    
    ‘He doesn’t,’ said Don.
    
    ‘Who does then?’ Nance asked.
    
    Heath received another text, the word ‘Bored’ and a selfie. In this one, her head was wrapped in a towel and water from a shower was clinging to a bare collarbone. She’d put on lipstick for it. ‘Sexy,’ he wrote back, knowing she wanted more than that. It was called a trap for a reason. He wanted more too. He wanted to know that the image was only for him. He wanted to sit her on his lap in a big empty house with giant windows facing a lake. He wanted a boat.
    
    ‘Why do none of us know her?’ Nance said.
    
    Don and Heath met in their first semester of college. The friendship hardened on the infamous night they liked to talk about not talking about. ‘We do not discuss the infamous night,’ was a refrain he and Don and Matt would still say, making a zipper motion over their lips. There had been a house party, likely at some dilapidated, shared Victorian with a torn-up yard but appearing in their memories as a mansion with never-ending kegs. They had conspired before arriving to lie about being freshmen. Every one of them ended up with a girl or two that evening, in bathrooms or bedroom closets. At one point Heath zeroed in on two girls and elegantly brought Don into the conversation, dividing to conquer. Don never wanted to hang out with the philosophy students again. Heath could still see him cheering, holding an open bottle of whiskey over his head as they walked up the street away from that house, the sun rising.
    
    ‘He was my wingman from day one,’ Don would tell new acquaintances, an arm over Heath’s shoulder. That was before Nance, who asked Don to move in with her as soon as his lease was up, less than a year into their relationship. It didn’t make sense, him finding a new place, when she had a whole inherited house. There were ball-and-chain jokes here and there, but otherwise, Don seemed, more than most of the guys Heath had seen settle down, genuinely happy.
    
    Once they were alone, Heath would ask Don what was up – how he was really doing. Because if Don had indeed gone to a woman’s home after some midnight cry for help, the possibility of an affair had to have crossed his mind. But what constituted an affair? Were the rules of a relationship, in this milieu and moment, such that no one was allowed to lean back into the past, that everyone was always obligated to stoop forward? Heath had always wondered if there wasn’t a way to auto-renew some girls, restarting the process of knowing them, with adjusted settings. If he thought about it, every girl still meant something to him, and maybe always would. And if they aligned sexually but not otherwise, did it follow that they couldn’t go on aligning in that one way?
    
    These were people, after all, not train cars. One did not simply transfer to the next, heading always in the so-called right direction. Life and time weren’t like that; each instant contained every instant that had ever and would ever occur. Even if he couldn’t quite grasp it, Heath believed this with all he had.
    
    Girls would often lean on him after their breakups with subsequent men, happy at first to wiggle back into his arms, this time without expectations. But then, in bed, a conversation about stability would start, and in due course they would leave with a new determination to not contact him. Sometimes, they would return yet again. It was sad, he decided, that such women were so accustomed to breaking things off the moment they didn’t get their way. Still, he knew it wasn’t entirely their fault.
    
    Nance opened a bag of Corn Nuts. ‘What does she look like?’ Her crunching forced a casual tone.
    
    ‘You wouldn’t be jealous.’
    
    ‘No?’ Nance threw another handful into her mouth. ‘Can I see her?’
    
    ‘And what would that do?’ Don’s voice had a squeezed composure to it too now. Heath had heard of couples embracing infidelity as a coping mechanism. If they forgot he was there, maybe they could take a huge step in their relationship.
    
    ‘What does she look like?’
    
    ‘Ugly,’ said Don.
    
    Nance bunched the Mylar bag in one hand and dropped it in the footwell. Heath saw Don glance at the freshly vacuumed mat under her feet, his mouth just open enough to let out a fricative. From the back seat, he watched as Nance lunged sideways, grasping at Don’s shoulder, clawing at his wrists, finally launching herself up onto her knees and crashing down, pro-wrestler style, into the driver’s seat. Heath saw Don’s hands let go of the wheel in confusion. He watched as Nance took over steering, thrashing them left and right until they hit a metal guardrail, and the sound blocked out any of the words they were screaming, any of the thoughts Heath had, any other instant that had occurred in his life or ever would.
    
     
    
    Heath came back from the kitchen and settled on a corner of the rug near Matt, handing him the beer he’d requested. He sipped from his own, a hoppy local brew with green and pink spirals on its label. Don rose from his seat in the big armchair and fetched a piece of wood for the fire. The absent hosts had left a pile of perfectly chopped logs, as clean as sliced Gouda with brown wax rinds, in an iron basket next to a set of hanging tools.
    
    Nance entered from the half-bathroom and stood near Don. She picked up a pair of firewood tongs that accordioned apart and together. ‘These are nicer than ours,’ she mumbled to herself, continuing a pattern of scrutinizing each of the house’s communal objects, from serving spoon to towel rack. All the guests did this, owing to the inevitable contrasts and parallels that could be made to the things they had at home.
    
    The car was all scraped up on one side, and that was the first thing anyone saw when it pulled up. Don said that they’d gotten into an accident. Nance had helped him come up with a story about someone drifting into their lane and running them off the road. Had they been going any faster, the party decided, things could have been much, much worse, and so the annual reunion was also a celebration of their survival. No one was injured, only rattled, and the adrenaline made them better than ever, more than fine, happy to be alive, together again, approaching middle age, away from Matt’s kids and their mother. Matt’s girlfriend, Leandra, was meeting everyone for the first time. To her, nothing could be off, because she had nothing with which to compare.
    
    Leandra was, contrary to everyone’s expectations, a normal person, with pores that pulled straight when she smiled and a few grays at the temples growing out of their latest dye treatment. The discrepancy between her and the old college friends was only recognizable in the details of a braided twine bracelet threaded with amber beads and a silver anklet made from tiny, linked paperclips, each hinting at a history of impulsiveness, travel, and street food on cloud-level terrain.
    
    ‘Tomorrow, we can take the canoe out,’ said Matt. He’d made the arrangements and read through the laminated binder of instructions. The boat, oars and life jackets were in the garage and part of the deal. There was a chest filled with half-empty bottles of bug spray and sunscreen, too, he informed them. It was amazing, the way things accumulated at the secondary homes of others. He had noticed doubles of books on the shelves.
    
    Heath wondered if Matt saw how quiet Don and Nance were after dinner, but then, Matt was never known for his perceptiveness, and besides, fires tend to permit, even beckon silence. Nance, cross-legged on the carpet, stared into the hearth and the wet of her
    eyes reflected its movement, resembling the quiver of tears. Don sat on an ottoman and held an iron poker in both hands, face
    lowered, eyelids and forehead reddening, lips folded inward. As the air around them changed temperature and density, Heath saw
    them all as meat being smoked and sealed, their outsides crisping
    and their insides tenderizing. Leandra cleared her throat, sipped
    from a wineglass, and laughed, or said a word that was the sound of a laugh.
    
    ‘I was in a car accident once. I was seventeen. Sixteen? I was with my dad, in Mexico. My dad isn’t Mexican. I mean, he also didn’t live in Mexico. I didn’t know him as a kid, and then, once we met, we’d go on these trips instead of me visiting him. Or him visiting me. I’ve never asked him why.’
    
    Heath felt sorry for Leandra, not because she hadn’t known her father growing up or because she’d been in a car accident, but because her expectations for the weekend were likely nowhere close to being met. He wondered how she and Matt would discuss the group dynamic that night in bed. Then, of course, he pictured them having sex.
    
    ‘We were on this vacation with his girlfriend and the whole thing was strange because they were basically strangers to me. My grandparents lived in Boston, so I thought I knew what Catholic churches were like, but the ones in Mexico looked like birdhouses on Christmas trees. It was hard to take anything seriously – everything was like a toy, even their places of worship.
    
    ‘But so, we were driving along these cliffs, and we smashed into the back of a car that had smashed into another car, one after the other, all crumpled into each other, with smoke everywhere, dust, horns blaring, people yelling, dogs barking. This is how I remember it. Somehow, I’m seeing it from an aerial view, which of course I couldn’t have had.
    
    ‘I was wearing my seat belt, and it snapped my stomach. I thought I was going to throw up. I remember the sound, like a smack, like someone slapping both your ears at once. I guess we were the last in the pile-up. There were cars driving around us. We played a game, guessing the color of the next one to pass by.
    
    ‘We waited there for hours, in the heat, with no AC. Eventually the police came, and a tow truck, and pulled us all apart one by one, and my dad had to speak with someone in his terrible Spanish. It was dark by the time we could be towed away, back in the direction we’d come from. We ended up staying in the same motel we’d left that morning, and I think that was the end of the trip. The car was a rental, so who knows what returning it was like. I can’t remember that part at all.
    
    ‘What I remember the most vividly is the ride in the tow truck, up in the front seat, all of us squished together and silent, except the driver speaking into his radio. We had to go past all the busted cars to get onto another highway. It went from bad to worse; the crash at the front was just twisted metal. It wasn’t obvious what had caused the original collision, or even which cars were involved; they were so, so torn up.
    
    ‘There was an ambulance that must have come from the other way, and it was just then lifting someone inside, and that’s the part that horrified me, that I’d been trying to kill time, lying on a big rock in the shade, and meanwhile there was someone down the road maybe bleeding to death. Then I really thought I’d throw up. It made no sense, why our car got taken care of before that person was in a hospital. There must have been many, many serious injuries. Maybe deaths.
    
    ‘I saw this big group of people – all ages, old, babies, everyone – some lying on blankets on the dirt, some sitting in strollers and wheelchairs. It was dark but I could see blood on clothes, makeshift bandages and slings. They were lit by our headlights. The red glow of the ambulance made everything look bloody. All the cars were bright colors – not like here. I was in a T-shirt and shorts, but everyone else was dressed for winter. It sounds bad, but I remember there were people dressed as clowns – some kind of traditional thing, I think. But in full costume, with makeup, noses, ruffled collars.’
    
    Nance started to laugh. Heath caught Matt’s eye, and they laughed too, looking over at Don, who was looking away, smiling. It was a long joke, Heath decided, having stopped listening halfway through. Clowns in Mexico.
    
    ‘It sounds funny, but it wasn’t funny at all,’ said Leandra. ‘It’s a terrible memory I have.’
    
    Everyone else was cracking up. Was there any more beer? No, but someone had seen a fifth of vodka in the back of a cabinet. They decided it would not be a bad idea to open it and replace it with a new bottle before leaving. Leandra was being gently hazed, but it would do her and her relationship good, Heath decided, to have something to recover from once they all went their separate ways. He took out his phone and texted the girl that he’d be back the day after next. They arranged to meet at a bar near his place that night.
    
     
    
    ‘We almost died,’ said Heath, handing the girl a drink, something she’d ordered off a cardstock menu. It came in a beveled glass, garnished with what looked like a pine-tree clipping. She sipped, let a smile start, then sucked the corners of her mouth in to show she was paying attention. Heath set his glass of beer on a paper coaster. ‘Yeah. If there had been a car behind us, that would have been it. A huge pileup. Probably many deaths.’
    
    ‘But you aren’t hurt?’ She looked at the door, then back at
    Heath, again smiling, then biting the insides of her cheeks, ‘No one got hurt?’
    
    ‘A total miracle.’
    
    ‘How’d you get back?’
    
    ‘I took a bus. They – my friends – were afraid of driving the whole way without getting the car looked at, so they went to a mechanic out there.’
    
    He had vowed not to, but he ended up telling her everything: Don’s ostensible indiscretion, Nance’s overblown reaction, the fogginess of the ensuing trip. All reunions perspire with their own suppressed histories, but this was extreme: a suppression of the most recent of histories, an exaggeration of his own fifth-wheel status.
    
    He told her about Matt’s girlfriend, who was nice, and who had no idea. He told her that time had started to feel stretchy, every moment embedded in those before it, or wrapped around itself like a crescent roll, not flat and pointed like a triangle of dough.
    
    The weekend had been an exercise in restraint. When they arrived, everyone claimed their rooms and then explored the house, hunting out their own corners. Heath sought out the grill, making sure it was dry and had enough propane. When he wandered back inside, he found Nance perched over a glass table covered in jigsaw pieces. On the box was a still life of a bird skull and a glass bell jar placed atop yellowing pages covered in scribbled non-words. She frowned, picking up one tiny piece and attempting to fit it into another. Over the following days, the puzzle took up hours of their time. Everyone, even Don, joined her in constructing the border, but by the end of the trip, it wasn’t even half completed.
    
    ‘I just went along with everything,’ said Heath.
    
    ‘What?’ the girl asked.
    
    ‘Not my place to intervene.’
    
    ‘Why not?’
    
    ‘It’s awful, the way these people can’t communicate correctly.’
    
    ‘Correctly,’ she repeated.
    
    Heath watched her eyes narrow, saw female alliance express itself. ‘It’s sad,’ he said.
    
    ‘Are you going to vote?’ she asked.
    
    ‘I’m sorry, were we talking about politics?’
    
    ‘No. I’m curious.’
    
    ‘It’s just crazy,’ said Heath. ‘I almost died.’ That was the problem. That no one was ever really listening to what he was saying or trying to say. He drained the last of his beer, and without knowing if he would leave the bar altogether or simply detour to the men’s room and come back to this table, new subject in mind, he stood up and wandered away."

    "title": "Obituary of a Soft Porn Translator",

    "text": "Emily St George died thinking of oysters. The obituary writer didn’t know this, of course.

    What the obituary dictated was that Emily St George passed away at the age of fifty-seven, while on a short-lived vacation to a coastal town in Brittany, during the month of March. The writer indulged in descriptions of Emily’s ‘lunar’ skin under an ‘ephemeral’ muslin shirt, and it was these allusions to chilly Brittany, as well as to her inadequate clothes, that meant the newspaper accidentally captured Emily St George’s final mental state. Emily St George died of a heart attack buying oysters at a market stand, died thinking of oysters while buying six of them: no wonder she was a translator, but usually Emily St George was very careful in avoiding literalisms and easy metaphors.
    
    At half past noon, she told the vendor that she wanted to eat them on the beach, sitting on her flimsy folding chair while facing the ocean. She wished she had a wooden chair rather than a plastic one – nobody told her what the March wind could be like in Brittany. She had only ever travelled there in the summer, and according to what the oyster vendor told the obituary writer, she looked flustered, as if she had just pulled out patches of hair. The vendor was sorry about her death and also about the wind. He wished foreigners knew better.
    
    Oyster was a disturbing word for Emily St George. It forced her to think of translation, her longstanding occupation, as well as the recent change in her circumstances. As the obituary carefully noted, Emily St George was known among her inner circle for being an inveterate translator of romance novels from English into Italian. The newspaper didn’t cover the fact that lately work had dried up and Emily had started discussing the terms of her early retirement with her accountant. She had flown to Brittany because she didn’t want to acknowledge that fact either. The Italian publishing house was really sorry, they valued Emily’s contribution over the years, but they couldn’t keep flooding newsstands with pocket romances. Demand was changing, new trends were emerging overseas.
    
    Had the newspaper cared enough about Emily’s life to publish a more accurate obituary, surely a less poetic one, the editors would have learned that according to her many friends, Emily St George never traveled off season. The real motive behind the six oysters for lunch, the choice of coastal location in late winter, and the subsequent extreme wind on the day of her death, could be traced back to a phone call Emily had taken with her publisher one day in early February. After the call was over she’d started firing off texts to her friends right away, overcoming her secret shame and fear of being at fault in the whole matter. Her fear that her work had gone out of fashion. The recurring nightmare that an aging translator was like a glass of natural wine before it became widely popular.
    
    The taste of her translations must have gone musty and funky but no one had the guts to say so and pretended to like her wine out of politeness. On the other hand, not all translations were supposed to be palatable. In the case of old-fashioned romance novels, Emily knew that too much attention to style and language could spoil the product and take away the fun. Those books were supposed to be rancid.
    
    While speaking to her former publisher, Emily St George didn’t mention natural wines at all and was quite distressed to learn that the publication of pocket romances (or soft porn novels, if she was being honest) would drop from twenty-four to eight releases a month. These would no longer be short books meant to be read on the train or at the beach, but ‘proper’ novels with respectable layouts and hardback covers written by a new generation of diverse authors who were well-read and almost always online. This new arrangement called for fewer translators, and Emily St George was aware that she was not going to fit into the downsized team. Her translation style was too correct, which was fine by the new publishing standards, but as her correctness didn’t flow from her political consciousness or activism – being a side effect of her own education – it sounded rather boring. She was also aware that she was no longer suited for the job she thought she loved. Over the past few years, Emily had been invited to several panels on the impact of AI on translation, but she knew perfectly well that aging and the publishing industry were her enemies, not the machines. Machines were the conveyers of hostile ideas shaped by evil human beings and she resented facile AI polemicists with her whole heart. She stopped reading their circular long-form essays on the subject, none of them provided new ideas anyway.
    
    Emily St George had always maintained a deeply organic approach to translation. She was very intentional about this word, organic: she would read the whole text first and establish the tone, each linguistic nuance blooming from the other. Soft porn novels didn’t often require such finesse, but she had integrity.
    
    She understood the basic tropes of romance writing very quickly. At the beginning sex was landscape. Pleasure was in the valleys, in moderate climbs, it was found in the peaks and crests and tender buds of female breasts and vaginas. Women were mountains and men were rocks, orgasms were earthquakes, eruptions of liquid fire and thundering storms, and every piece of land, in the end, was colonized and spent. Cocks were trunks, desire was windy and watery, sex was usually a boat that would set sail after a few seconds ago, only to come back five pages later. There was never much in the way of narrative in the sorts of romances Emily translated.
    
    Then sex became food. It was juices, ripples, bites, peels, torn skins, scratches and savory drops. Bottoms were silky peaches and lips became cherries. Not that Emily St George ever reduced herself to using an eggplant or a banana, in real sex or otherwise, but in her own experience as a woman, fruit metaphors came in handier, and somehow felt more relevant to her daily life, or more accurately, to her memories of what real sex was all about.
    
    This penchant for fruit and vegetable metaphors had something to do with the very reason why she decided to become a translator. She had a good story about that – the obituary writer would have loved it.
    
    Back in 1984, over spring break, Emily St George took a painful trip to Tuscany with her parents, both of whom were artists. Her mother wore denim overalls and a brown bandana like a strawberry picker, and since she was bilingual – English and Italian – she flaunted her worldliness during minor daily interactions which often required no talking at all, just a brief exchange of money. Her mother’s abundant compliments with the market vendors made Emily feel sick and hide behind any stand she could find. One day this happened in a secondhand bookshop, where Emily found a copy of La luna e i falò by Cesare Pavese with a pastoral illustration on the cover. She opened it and read the epigraph: ‘For C. Ripeness is all’. Later she found out that the quote came from King Lear, yet this seemed irrelevant to her. Even the dedication to an American actress who dumped Pavese at some point felt strangely uninteresting. Ripeness was the word that did it for Emily St George: she imagined foreign words as mature fruits hanging from a tree, something she had to pick carefully; each fruit so ready to be tasted but also close to bursting. Handling her Italian, imagining the language as a peach or a fig, she felt the risk of overdoing it, of spilling juice all over the place. As a translator himself, Pavese must have known this feeling. Sure, he was very preoccupied with sex, but he was also a poet, a thinker. Dirty and sexy enough to have ripeness in his mind when writing that epigraph, but not surprising at all, in the end. Apparently, Pavese couldn’t get it up and compensated for his frustration with his pen.
    
    After that trip, Emily spent all of her following summers attending language classes in Italy, eventually she read all of Pavese and learned a lot about how to handle a character as if they were a landscape. She was taken by the abundance of rural images, the grapes, the grass and the open fields, which he used to characterize the cast of his novels. She felt bound for a sophisticated career, ready to honor her mother’s linguistic abilities in a more useful and practical manner, not for personal vanity but for the sake of literature, while helping the anglophone world become less monolingual and stiff. Despite these great expectations, how she ended up translating soft porn was not really a mystery.
    
    She had been pitching serious Italian writers to several publishers, especially dead women or lesser known losers, but that market was already taken. Those titles were dominated by serious translators, while she had no proper training and needed a job. Then, in the early nineties, she met a woman working for a publisher based in Milan interested in translating English pocket romances and her career finally took off; she learned fast in patterns and synonyms. She realigned her expectations and by Pavese’s age at the time of his premature death, Emily St George had translated an insane number of valleys, cherries, sails and thunderstorms, delivering twelve or fifteen books per year, for almost twenty-five years. She became a reliable mediator, hiding behind solid pseudonyms in case the name of the translator would be mentioned at all on the edition.
    
    Over time, her geopolitics improved. The early Saudi Arabian, Midwestern and ranch scenes moved to contemporary Europe and Japan. Still, Emily St George’s favorite translations were set on farms. The scenes of delivering cattle took the sexual edge off, they were bloody and phlegmatic and tested her rhythm and talent. She had a real issue with women’s broken careers: she hated retired ballerinas and anchorwomen moving inland. Usually these women were looking for Christmas in little arts and crafts markets on a Sunday morning and found Republican politics instead.
    
    Before she left for her final vacation in Brittany, Emily bought two books from a new generation of writers and translators. As she began reading, she suddenly realized what was happening in these books: sex was just sex. It had nothing to do with climate or orchards. Cocks were cocks and cunts were cunts. As for the geography, the world had shrunk: no one was traveling, chartering or navigating new terrain anymore, it was a lot of college or backyard drama. A lot of BDSM. Verbs were restored to their original density: spanking and hammering. If anything, it was like a porn video set in a little hardware shop, slightly mechanical and a little too literal. Nobody was smoking or eating a steak with a malevolent glare in front of a chimney. Smells changed. Whisky was banned. There was a lot of music, very specific music: not simple genres like adult-oriented rock or soft jazz, but proper songs and bands that apparently everyone was familiar with, everyone except Emily. Lots of ellipses, but not in descriptions about fucking, never there. Even in the songs mentioned in the books, figurative language had become a chimera.
    
    She could admit the plots were better. But were these books getting anyone off, or making them cry, which is what often happened to Emily. Just days before she died, Emily had been reading in her flimsy chair, facing the ocean, as sex became orthopedic. Hours went by and sex was geometry. Women had careers again. Men were often going through a phase. They were fragile. Women had friends now, they were no longer segregated in cabins under a blizzard. They were called Dolores or Layla. They were escaping Christmas, then looking for Christmas again, then converting to Korean housekeeping. They no longer cared about pumpkins and apples but were into specialty coffees with powdered herbs inside. They had good politics, they had their hearts broken, but then they made speedy recoveries. Happiness was usually reached when subs realized they were really doms and doms became asexual: sex died in bureaucracy.
    
    This was not the first time Emily St George had had a career crisis. In 2004, she turned to crime novels for a while, but she couldn’t handle the formulaic plots: every time you kill a girl in that kind of story, she is already dead. She felt dirty and gave up quickly, told no one about it.
    
    She went back to her soft porn and when she found the word ‘zephyr’ to describe the color of a pool in Bali, she felt so content that she reached out to the author to thank him. To her, that lexical choice was equal to Fitzgerald’s usage of pink in the Côte d’Azur in Tender Is the Night. Some of the authors cared, and Emily exchanged nice emails with them, but that was when sex was still hidden behind sex.
    
    ‘She looked as if she had been pulling out chunks of her hair’ the oyster vendor kept saying to anyone asking after Emily’s heart attack. As she lay dying among the fish juices dripping from the vendor’s cart, Emily St George thought it had been a long time since she’d made proper use of an oyster in a translation.
    
    Oysters used to be very popular in genitalia analogies, although using ‘ostrica’ for vagina sounded bad in Italian, not representative enough, so clitorises became pearls. They were gone now too. Sex had once been a jewelry store, a jewelry store built on top of a fishery.
    
    Immobilized on the floor outside the oyster cart, Emily’s mind was racing along the hysterical pumping of her heart; the fluids around her smelled so bad, like sex gone wrong with a philandering corsair in the eighteenth century, but the pools of liquid glistened under the midday sun as if precious: iridescent, speckled, somehow revolting in their ephemeral colors. Not that she would know it exactly, but it was a common mistake to think that a translator should have firsthand knowledge of what they are translating. Much like the sexless authors of many great erotic novels, it was all a matter of imagination. And Emily was great at that. The only thing she remembered about that time she had sex with an older man, a friend of her father’s, was precisely that disgusting transcendence, something slippery inside her throat, wanting it to end as quick as possible, but still savoring that bitterness later at dinner, a sensorial oxymoron that she carried forever within her memories. A disgusting pleasure.
    
    Someone in her family decided that she should wear white in her coffin. When Emily was still alive various family members had speculated on her virginity as much as teenage critics had speculated on Pavese’s impotence. Little did they know, and Emily never contradicted them, too busy with work and with friends. A mean cousin, the one she never liked, believed her body inside the casket still gave off a fish smell, but it was only the overripe flowers. The obituary opted for an unnecessary flourish by indicating that unlike in crime stories, at least in romance novels women never died and somehow Emily St George would stay immortal in their imaginary lives. By no means a sentimental person, Emily St George would have agreed with that from her premature funeral in that windy coastal town. And when a thunderstorm broke over her relatives and friends staring at the coffin, it was felt that she deserved it: hadn’t she set sail on the most perilous journey of all, climbing endless stairs of ecstasy, only to be showered with the infinite light of God, in the realm where no geography or genders could be bound and gagged by language, forced to submit to the specter of a dominant culture? Finally unburdened by the torments of translation, Emily died happy and free.

    "text": "The time had come to freeze my eggs. Before I did that, I needed to see Cameron. Those days I was prone to bouts of socially inappropriate laughter that veered into even less appealing sobs. I wasn’t ashamed. My mother had died in a terrible accident and if I neglected to have a child someday soon-ish I would never again know real, abiding love. Cameron and I were in touch intermittently, saw each other every few years, and on the fourth of September I started my period and gave him a call. He and his carpenter wife Stephanie welcomed me into their home exactly two weeks later.

    ‘You’re in a PhD program?’ Stephanie passed me the carton of beef lo mein. For my visit they had ordered takeout, albeit the expensive kind from a restaurant you could read about in the newspaper. They lived in Brooklyn with their two small children. In his emails over the decades, Cameron had made clear they lived ‘hand to mouth’, meaning on an annual income considered kingly in New Haven.
    
    ‘And you build furniture.’ I hoped we could get this part out of the way quickly. I disliked the helplessness that washed over people when I recited the title of my dissertation or tried to explain what linguistics was.
    
    ‘Well, I restore vintage pieces.’ Stephanie wore a chambray shirt and her short hair in stubby braids. She had permanent podcast voice.
    
    Cameron said, ‘Steph scrounges estate sales for mid-century stuff that’s been beat to shit, then she fixes it up and re-sells it for ten times what she paid.’
    
    ‘You make it sound crass.’
    
    ‘Nothing crass about it. Beautiful business, beautiful work.’
    
    Pleased, Stephanie rolled her eyes. ‘What are you writing on?’
    
    Cameron answered for me. ‘The semantic effects of throat-clearing across romance languages.’
    
    ‘Seriously?’ Stephanie said.
    
    ‘Not just throat-clearing,’ I clarified. ‘Also filler words. Like uh, um, like. The French euh, the Italian ehm, and so on.’ I looked at Cameron. ‘I’m impressed you remember.’
    
    I had been in love with Cameron since we were teenagers. He had nary an artsy nor bookish bone in his body. In high school he listened to Jon Bon Jovi’s solo albums and played ultimate frisbee. After graduating two years ahead of me, he joined a frat at Cornell, and after college he got a job at Merrill Lynch. Cameron was kind and courteous. He was handsome not in fact but in character, his sleeves always rolled precisely to his elbows, his clean smiles like beacons of approval. In pictures on the internet he threw his children toward the clouds, certain of their swift return to his steady arms.
    
    The children were in bed. We’d met briefly. When I arrived at the apartment and called them by their names, they corkscrewed their faces and asked, ‘How do you know our names?’ Lila and Otis weren’t impressed by the number of years I’d allegedly known Daddy. Nothing prior to their birth really counted. Why would it?
    
    ‘I was sorry to hear about your mother,’ Stephanie said.
    
    ‘We’re both so sorry,’ Cameron said. ‘I saw you together in a restaurant once. That Italian place by 287.’ He and I were from Tarrytown, meaning we had to travel ridiculously far before we could claim to have grown up in the city. ‘Like an Olive Garden but not a chain? I remember thinking oh, so that’s where Lillian gets her beauty.’
    
    That he referenced my beauty in front of his wife astonished me. Stephanie wasn’t astonished. She ate a fried shrimp and demurely pulled the tail from her teeth.
    
    ‘My beauty? My hair, anyway.’
    
    ‘Your beautiful hair,’ Stephanie confirmed.
    
    All three of us drank London Sours. Cameron loved a fun cocktail. ‘You know, it’s weird.’ A primal vulnerability tore through me. ‘Since she died, I’ve become fixated on having biological children. Sooner rather than later, although I’d like a husband.’
    
    When we were kids, Cameron often called me dazzling. A real charmer. Even then I knew he meant kind of a freak.
    
    ‘Oh?’ Stephanie was Brooklyn-intrigued, fertility discourse her jam.
    
    ‘I always used to think, no shame in being thirty-five and unpartnered. I actually imagined it was ideal to grow up first. Become less of a child myself. Less insufferable in general.’
    
    ‘Absolutely,’ Stephanie said.
    
    ‘I thought I could always adopt if I had to. But after my mom died it was like, bio or bust!’ Here’s where I laughed too hard. ‘I have some money now, from the life insurance. I’ve done the bloodwork and the initial ultrasound. My numbers are good. I might start next month.’ Here’s where I began to weep.
    
    The table was made from an asymmetrical slab of polished wood. A jumble of Lego and Magna-tiles had been pushed aside to make room for dinner. Stephanie said, ‘Have you considered a sperm donor? It’s cheaper, and you could start trying right away.’
    
    ‘Babe.’ Cameron gave his wife a menacing look he’d never once given me.
    
    ‘What? Lillian seems to know what she wants.’
    
    ‘She just told us she doesn’t want to be a single mom. She’s still in school. She’s still young!’
    
    ‘Women don’t lose their viability the moment they have kids—’
    
    ‘Her soulmate could be out there.’
    
    ‘And if she’s already a mom he’s going to, what? Run in the opposite direction?’
    
    ‘Babe, don’t be obtuse. You know everything’s harder for single mothers.’
    
    ‘I’ve heard that, yes.’
    
    ‘But sometimes you wonder?’
    
    There was a fraught silence. I forked a dumpling and said, ‘I actually would consider a sperm donor.’ I chewed and swallowed. ‘If I knew the guy.’
    
    Neither of them had a response to that. Whether my ambitions were transparent or opaque, I was too drunk to know. Halfway through our fourth round, approaching the time I should have left, Stephanie asked if I still spoke to Lucas.
    
    In high school, Lucas had kept a lock of my hair tucked inside his wallet next to a condom I’d promised him we’d use the night of our junior prom, knowing we wouldn’t make it that far. He was two years younger than Cameron, same as me, and objectively the hotter sibling. It was Cameron who’d set us up, presumably sensing my attachment to himself and wanting me around without wanting me. I cooperated. For the entirety of tenth grade, I dated Cameron’s joint-rolling, Gertrude Stein-reading, ponytailed little brother. ‘You’re perfect for each other,’ Cameron often marveled, and I agreed the situation was near perfect. Their parents invited me on family vacations and ordered me a sixteenth birthday cake from the bakery on Broadway. As Lucas’s girlfriend, I enjoyed unfettered access to Cameron as mentor and confidante, had countless opportunities to wander into his room, flop atop his unmade bed and groan with teenage angst. Together the brothers drove me to school, picked me up from French club on Tuesdays, Latin on Thursdays, and consoled me when I fought bitterly with my mom. If we were ever apart, like on a Sunday morning or the occasional federal holiday, they’d pass the phone back and forth, seamlessly sharing one half of our unending conversation. I made out with Lucas only, slipped a hand past the waistband of only Lucas’s boxers, but the boys used the same laundry detergent. It was easy to pretend.
    
    I broke up with Lucas in August, the day Cameron left for Cornell.
    
    As an adult, I became a decent person. For my friends I could be attentive and selfless. When I wanted to activate my goodness, I channeled Cameron – all those welcoming smiles, his habit of appearing equal parts charmed by and concerned about everyone he met. Still, I understood my isolation at thirty-five as a meandering, indirect result of how I’d treated Lucas in high school. Every man I’d been with since was tainted by the same second-bestness, that quality of near-perfection I’d inflicted on my first boyfriend. Twenty years had passed and I understood Cameron and I were incompatible, barely knew each other. I did not believe in wealth management and he did not care about the semantic effects of anything. Our fundamental discordance wouldn’t take a PhD to perceive. And yet, how could I be sure? We never did undress each other. We hadn’t kissed. To this day, when he entered a room, returning with another round of increasingly sour London Sours, my heart expanded.
    
    ‘Lucas doesn’t want to talk to me,’ I said into my drink.
    
    ‘He wanted to marry you,’ Cameron countered.
    
    ‘Wanting to marry someone and wanting to talk to them aren’t the same.’
    
    Stephanie swiveled toward Cameron, like he’d been called to the stand to testify. Cameron yawned and asked if I would stay the night.
    
    ‘I got a room,’ I revealed.
    
    ‘Back to Connecticut in the morning?’ Stephanie asked.
    
    ‘Bright and early.’
    
    ‘Do you read on the train, or—’
    
    ‘No way.’ Cameron winked at me. ‘That’s when she does her scheming.’
    
    Conveniently, as I was pulling on my boots, one of the children unleashed a scream. Stephanie hurried to quiet the woken child before it disturbed the sleeping one. Cameron stooped to offer me a chaste hug, and, into his left ear, I said, ‘I’m staying at Hotel Le Bleu and I don’t need to leave for Grand Central until ten.’
    
    He ran in the mornings. On a Saturday in early September, he might run ten or fifteen miles across the Brooklyn bridge and weave through lower Manhattan. His wife wouldn’t miss him for an hour or even two.
    
    Cameron righted himself. ‘Oh, we have a thing.’ He peered down the dark hallway. We could hear Stephanie whisper-singing ‘Brokedown Palace’ with irritation. ‘I would say breakfast, but the kids have a birthday party.’
    
    I believed him. Still, the next day, I woke early and languished in bed until the minute I had to check out of my room. Just in case Cameron changed his mind and jogged to my hotel and quietly impregnated me.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Initially, when injecting myself with a collection of bawdily-named medications, I felt resourceful and self-reliant, unafraid to pinch my stomach and plunge the thirty-gauge needle into my flesh. I played a YouTube video of a lady performing the same procedure on herself for company. We cursed as our needles went in, whimpered as we eased them out. Wasn’t it empowering? That we could doctor ourselves, harvest ourselves, duplicate ourselves. We didn’t need husbands – or, we did, but in our own sweet time.
    
    Then my ovaries ballooned, became painful to the touch. My head hurt. My abdomen swelled and hardened like I was pregnant already, but I wasn’t and might never be. Bowel movements became a memory. I stopped answering texts, skipped a department potluck, avoided my dissertation and let my laptop die. Warned not to exert myself, I stayed in my third-floor apartment with its fridge in its living room and lay belly-down on the couch, hands beneath my hipbones to keep my inflamed reproductive organs from getting smashed against the cushions. I stayed like that for days, leaving only for ultrasound appointments and to collect the food I ordered but couldn’t bring myself to eat.
    
    Surgery should have meant the end of my suffering, at least psychologically, but it was only the beginning. My numbers were indeed good. ‘We got twenty-seven,’ the nurse said the moment I could process language again.
    
    ‘That’s promising, right?’
    
    ‘At your age, it’s a windfall. You shouldn’t have to go through this again.’
    
    I laughed, then wept.
    
    My cab driver, an older woman, wore solar system leggings and didn’t ask about my health. Coming home to the bathroom trashcan full of used syringes, the couch bearing the depression of my prostrate form, was nearly unendurable. I had no one to take care of me. The cramps started and did not ease for a week.
    
    I thought if the pain had been the consequence of pregnancy or birth, that would be okay; the pain would be a sacrifice and a victory. But this pain marked my mistakes. This pain stripped the world of its sheen and left behind a joyless haze. I hated myself for being alone, for being fertile or not fertile, biologically female, biological, logical enough to plan for the future, insane enough to beg another woman’s husband to relieve me of the chore, to have failed to captivate Cameron when I had my chance with him, to have discarded his brother, to have discarded every man after him.
    
    Eleven days post-retrieval I took a laxative and temporarily found God. On the twelfth day the cramping ceased and I got my period. I called Lucas. He lived in New Jersey now and was perhaps still devoted to me. Did he want to visit that weekend?
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    We met at the German bar on Chapel Street where people in my program went to witness one another thriving, or surviving, or alive. Lucas rested his hand on a volume of Knausgaard’s struggle. His train book, he said. He was still stoned and ponytailed but no longer the objectively hotter sibling. Time is not kind to the bookish, I’ve realized. We ordered beers, and Lucas leaned over our candlelit table to kiss me lightly on the mouth. Having begun a new, unmodified menstrual cycle, I was free to drink, smoke, fuck, whatever it was I normally did with my body. My precise goals were obscure to me, or maybe not obscure but absurd: I wanted to get back together with Lucas, or I wanted to apologize, sincerely, for ever having been with him. Maybe both.
    
    Like Cameron always said, we were perfect for each other. For about an hour I thought I might redeem myself by falling in love with Lucas for real. We talked about the last twenty years: his brief, post-Wesleyan flirtation with heroin, then with antiquarian bookselling, then a PhD in comparative literature from Columbia followed by a prestigious postdoc at Princeton. He didn’t tell me he was sorry my mother had died. I mentioned her terrible accident and he lowered his gaze and nodded to indicate he, too, knew tragedy and grief, that two souls aligned as ours needn’t speak words as trite as sorry. This was a move deployed exclusively by people who had never lost anything – but I let it slide. We gossiped about Cameron, that normie bastard. With his carpenter wife and his Gowanus condo.
    
    ‘I saw them last month,’ I said.
    
    ‘I heard. I’m surprised Steph let you in the house. She’s so jealous of anyone Cam’s ever been, like, affiliated with.’
    
    ‘She can be tense,’ I allowed.
    
    ‘I love my brother, but I couldn’t live that life. She’s got him by the balls. Every time I call Cam he’s taking his kids to the allergist.’
    
    ‘Do you want children, though?’
    
    Lucas laughed, then grimaced, like I’d said something unpleasant yet inevitable yet kind of hot.
    
    ‘Sorry,’ I said. ‘I’ve become obsessed with reproduction.’
    
    ‘I know.’
    
    Of course he knew, and abruptly I wanted to not be where I was. To be transported to an airport bar or the DMV. Mortified, I played dumb. ‘Excuse me?’
    
    ‘Cameron warned me you might try this. And listen—’
    
    ‘No,’ I said. ‘No, no. I froze my eggs.’
    
    Lucas cleared his throat. ‘You did?’
    
    ‘That what I was trying to tell you.’
    
    Quietly, as if betrayed, Lucas said, ‘My brother made it sound like you were desperate for another way. I can’t believe you went through with all that.’
    
    ‘Well, I’m almost thirty-six. And I still might find someone.’
    
    ‘Wow.’ Lucas grabbed the candle from the center of our wobbly table, became fascinated by the flame.
    
    ‘The retrieval was pretty recent. I’m still recovering.’
    
    ‘I could never do it that way.’
    
    ‘What way?’
    
    ‘In a lab. The whole test tube baby thing. I don’t fuck with that.’
    
    Here is where my laughter became cold.
    
    ‘Even ethically – like, you might end up with more embryos than you’ll use? And then you just throw them out?’
    
    ‘You donate them to research.’
    
    He shook his head. ‘I just think, like, if I ever have children, I want them conceived the old-fashioned way. Two people fucking in love, in a bed. Exchanging their actual bodily fluids, you know?’
    
    ‘I was a test tube baby.’
    
    ‘Come on. That sci-fi shit didn’t exist yet.’ Lucas drained his beer.
    
    ‘It was early days, but it existed. My mom was forty and single. She used a sperm bank and did IVF.’
    
    In the orangey glow of the bar, Lucas looked depleted but not sorry. ‘Okay. I obviously didn’t know that. But it’s not, like, a judgement on your humanity. It’s just not what I want for my family.’
    
    I was determined to be decent to him, so I facilitated another ten minutes of useless, low stakes chitchat before suggesting we close our tab. The bar was crowded and we waited for the check. Standing so close to Lucas, among all the cheerfully drunken graduate students who had yet to realize they were running out of time, I felt no attachment to him. My loneliness was acute.
    
    ‘Why did you come here if you thought I wanted you to get me pregnant?’
    
    He pretended not to hear, forcing me to repeat history’s most humbling question. I stood on my toes and half shouted. Lucas blinked and I realized two things: first, that he truly hadn’t heard me, and second, that he would have done it.
    
    I walked him to the train station. Lucas punched me gently on the arm to say goodbye. We wouldn’t see each other again in our lifetimes if we could help it.
    
    I was two miles from my apartment. I walked on, hungry for the exercise, the still novel absence of pain. My mother had been walking home from the Tarrytown Metro North station when a delivery van turned left on red, struck and killed her. Our relationship had been ordinary, meaning we didn’t get along and she was the person I loved most in the world. I found it extremely difficult to live without her love – which was why my fantasies of motherhood borrowed nothing material from my childhood and hinged instead on the promise of no longer being alone.
    
    In a few years I would pay a surgeon to slip one of my perfectly preserved, fertilized eggs inside my uterus. Pregnancy would rouse my senses, render me alert and animal to the world. I would labor heroically, as all women must. I believed my daughter would open her eyes and understand we belonged together. She would be affectionate and confident and have my hair. Growing up, she might resent my lack of social graces, my constant throat-clearing ending in blunt propositions. Well into her adolescence I would try to hold her hand when we crossed the street. She would hate that, and still she would know things about me no one else knew: that I rub my feet together before I fall asleep and immediately upon waking. That my dreams are often in the wrong language: a New Haven bus driver yelling at me in French, a lover soothing me in Spanish. That I prefer a small, clean home to a large, disordered one. That I am forever torn between spontaneity and all my careful plans.
    
    Of course, pregnancy was hell and childbirth the single most harrowing experience of my life – but I was right about everything else."

    "text": "I tell Ma that I’m feeling old, that I think I might finally be

    an old woman.
    
    I say it to say something.
    
    Ma says nothing.
    
    I imagine it’s hard for Ma to think of me as an old woman as
    
    that would mean that she would be very old.
    
    And quite understandably she doesn’t like the idea of being a
    
    very old woman because this is not something she ever had
    
    in mind for herself.
    
    But we cannot get away from it. The fact of her being a very
    
    old woman.
    
    I know how old she is because every time I look at her, I
    
    think of how I’ll kiss her closed eyes and be among those to
    
    watch her body as it’s lowered into the ground.
    
    Even though in reality that may not be what happens
    
    because Ma might well have her own plans which have yet to
    
    be revealed. And I think I’m happy to not press Ma for what
    
    it is she wants in the circumstances.
    
    You might think, given where we are, that every day would
    
    be precious but we are beyond that.
    
    That is how old she is.
    
    But there’s another woman who is even older than Ma, who
    
    is in fact the oldest woman in the world, who lives in Japan
    
    and no, she doesn’t want to carry the flame at the Olympic
    
    Opening Ceremony. Let some other old woman do it, she
    
    says, tucking into her miso soup with a hunger that is both
    
    delicate and voracious.
    
    Is that her secret, I wonder.
    
    This is all I want, the old woman says, nodding at her soup,
    
    slurping one spoonful after another.
    
    But I don’t believe her.
    
    I think she says this because she is the oldest woman alive
    
    and can say whatever she likes.
    
    I think what she really wants is to die but to say that would
    
    be a terrible shame.
    
    For us, I mean.
    
    We love that we have found someone we can call the oldest
    
    woman alive.
    
    We love that all she wants is to eat soup.
    
    We find her frugality charming.
    
    But maybe what she wants is to confound us with her
    
    apparent lack of desire. Maybe she’s had enough of our
    
    attention and silliness, our endless talk of the flame.
    
    But it doesn’t matter what she wants as live on is what she
    
    does, eating soup and avoiding the telephone.
    
    Like Ma.
    
    I like to rub Ma’s feet. The toes bunch together and curl
    
    under slightly. I take one foot and with my thumb press
    
    gently along the white tendons that splay out beneath the
    
    skin like brief, bony rays of light.
    
    Sometimes I want to ask Ma if things matter less the older
    
    you get, but know I won’t get a straight answer.
    
    We sit and watch the birds who have taken the place of our
    
    feelings.
    
    Every morning they hop here and there looking for food.
    
    Once a bird flew straight at our window.
    
    I stood and watched it lying there on the ground.
    
    Next time I looked it was gone.
    
    More than anything I don’t want her to be afraid.
    
    I stand up and say: Time for soup!
    
    Our meals have become very regular and important and
    
    what we eat has become one of the things Ma seems happy
    
    to talk about. We talk about what we’re going to have, what
    
    we’re having while we’re having it and then afterwards, what
    
    it was we had. Each meal contains a past, present and a
    
    future so that we can for a while forget about other things.
    
    I think there is still love between me and Ma but we are so
    
    easily distracted by the birds.
    
    And the soup she likes that I make.
    
    I hold up a plastic bag and say:
    
    Look Ma, they’re selling misshapen carrots in a bag with an
    
    exclamation mark – maybe so we don’t take them too
    
    seriously!
    
    Ma looks at me holding the bag.
    
    She has become extremely calm in the face of all things.
    
    I wonder if this will last.
    
    I wonder if she might be able to tell me what she’s really
    
    feeling. I wonder if it matters. I wonder if it matters whether
    
    the oldest woman in the world doesn’t tell the truth. Perhaps
    
    she’s trying to tell us that in the end these things don’t matter.
    
    That other things do, like the birds.
    
    Once we saw a pigeon with half its wing unfeathered. All
    
    you could see were the white stems but still it strutted
    
    around the patio as if it didn’t know.
    
    Ma looks out the window.
    
    Or perhaps, I say, still holding the bag, they’re telling us we
    
    have nothing to fear!
    
    She might be smiling only it’s hard to tell because her face is
    
    turned towards the birds.
    
    I’d like to be able to say that I can’t wait to get very old but
    
    what I think I mean is that I can’t wait for this to be over.
    
    For Ma.
    
    I don’t mind about the woman in Japan.
    
    She can go on living as long as she likes, eating soup and
    
    refusing to carry the torch."

    "text": "Harper breezes in twenty minutes late with a shiner that takes up half her face. Even though I know better, I wince. The thing is hard to look at, the colors intense as a sunset. Harper’s desk is already set up with a sleek black laptop and the Trigonometry workbook she needs to get through by the end of the shoot, the book open on a page filled with triangles. There’s also a notebook for scratch paper and a row of new mechanical pencils neatly lined up and waiting. Yesterday she was scheduled to be in the trailer for at least three hours. I set her desk up but she never came in.

    Today she throws herself down in her chair, whips out a silver phone, the device barely thicker than a credit card.
    
    ‘You’re late,’ I say. There’s a tech guy in the trailer trying to fix the AC which Brennan’s mother has complained isn’t doing enough. I don’t know why but I want to put on a good show for the techie’s sake. I want him to think my work is important. I want him to think I belong here nestled among the talent. ‘You’re late,’ I repeat.
    
    ‘Take it up with Charlie Brown,’ Harper drawls. She snaps her phone shut and flips me the bird. I hear the techie snigger over his toolbox. He has the cover off the unit and is surrounded by a million thin screws, each one slowly sinking into the plush white wall-to-wall carpet.
    
    ‘Fine,’ I say. It’s not worth getting into it with Harper, especially when she’s in full make-up. I consider reminding her I have the power to close down the set, which would throw a serious financial wrench in everyone’s lives, but I can feel the techie’s eyes knifing me in the back so I decide to be above it all. ‘You need to finish that exercise,’ I say. Harper fires up her computer but I know she’s just checking her money. ‘As in today,’ I say. She’s one of the worst students I’ve ever had. Once she left the screen up on her bank account. I turned it off but not before I saw a double-digit figure followed by six zeros. Harper’s sixteen years old.
    
    Andy leans over in her direction. ‘How many?’ he whispers. Andy’s eighteen with green eyes and a baby smooth face which the ladies in hair and make-up claim he waxes. Word is his agent wants him to stay a kid as long as possible, be the kind of teen heartthrob you might see on the cover of Tiger Beat.
    
    ‘Seventeen takes,’ Harper says. ‘The last one took twenty minutes.’
    
    ‘Fucking A,’ says Andy. Brennan’s mother looks up from her knitting. ‘Sorry,’ he says, and flashes her a thousand-watt smile. Andy’s still a nice kid. He still says please and thank you any time he bums a cigarette. According to his file he’s been doing commercials since he was in diapers, but he landed a role as a homeless teen in last year’s indie hit and he’s been an It kid ever since. This is his first summer blockbuster, his first stint in the on-set school. This spring he’ll graduate back home in Utica with the rest of his class but out here in the desert he needs to stay on top of his coursework. ‘Can’t Charlie Brown get it together?’ Andy says to no one in particular. He begins tapping his pencil on his desk, jiggling his leg up and down. I know he’s hoping to go out later this afternoon with Gorgeous himself. Gorgeous is the movie’s leading man and has all afternoon free, a rarity – he’s practically in every shot – and has promised to take whoever’s around surfing on one of the giant dunes.
    
    ‘They’re way behind schedule,’ says Harper. She takes a long sip from a stainless-steel coffee mug. Last week she spilled it all over my briefcase as she was teetering in, most likely with a hangover, so I know she takes it black. ‘Charlie Brown can’t get his head out of his ass,’ she says. Brennan’s mom doesn’t bother to look up from her knitting, mostly because it’s true. The whole unit is almost a week behind thanks to the second director with the oddly shaped shaved head whom the entire cast and crew now call Charlie Brown thanks to a joke Gorgeous made the first week of production. Any more delays and the crew won’t get a deadline bonus.
    
    Brennan raises her hand. ‘Mr Faino,’ she says, ‘I’m done.’ The kid is a machine. At age six, she’s already doing fourth grade work. At this rate she’ll get through the curriculum by thirteen. The truth is Brennan’s the biggest star in the trailer. She gets at least five million a pic. Rumor has it she didn’t even have to audition for this role which is almost unheard of among child actors. She’s already been in more than twenty movies, movies which have grossed more than a half billion worldwide. On the set, everyone defers to her, even Harper. On Variety’s list of the one hundred most powerful women in Hollywood, Brennan ranks twenty-fourth.
    
    Today both she and Harper are in full period attire, each girl demure in an ankle-length calico dress. They’re supposed to be sisters, the children of missionaries living in nineteenth-century Africa. Andy plays their older brother who stumbles on a treasure map wedged in the eye socket of a human skull. Think Indiana Jones meets The Mummy but for the tween crowd. Throw in Gorgeous as the kids’ father and the studio’s reportedly sinking a hundred million into this one.
    
    Brennan hands her quiz to her mother who looks it over before handing it to me. Sometimes I have a hard time making eye contact with Brennan, her blue eyes big as fists. Off-camera there’s something about her, something alien and cold, like she’s been sent to Earth to study how kids are supposed to act. She reminds me of those baby Jesuses you see in Renaissance paintings, the baby Lord simply a small man with a double chin. Once I saw her holding a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos. She read the serving size, then picked out exactly fourteen chips before handing the bag to her assistant.
    
    I take out a pen and check her quiz, her handwriting in cursive and precise as a laser. It’s a state capitals test. She finished it in under five minutes. I correct one of her answers, then slap a silver star on it. I hand it back, and she sits checking it over like a prospector looking for gold. ‘Mr Faino,’ she says. Her voice is high but poised, controlled, and it finally comes to me, the thing about her voice I’ve been trying to place for the past few weeks. ‘Mr Faino,’ she says again, and I realize that the way she talks – her cadence and inflection, her carefully measured locution – makes her sound exactly like the current Secretary of State. ‘The capital of Kentucky is Frankfort, not Lexington.’
    
    ‘What?’
    
    ‘Frankfort.’ Her mother gives me a steely look, her knitting needles glinting like cutlery. Brennan rehands me her test.
    
    I can just imagine what the techie will tell the other gaffers. ‘Of course,’ I say. ‘Frankfort.’ I don’t even check the answer key. The kid is always right. I lick a gold star, stick it over the silver one, and hand it back. She gives me a look simultaneously filled with derision and pity, her huge blue eyes cold as starlight, a look that completely emasculates me. For the fourth time this week I realize I’m forty-nine years old and this kid could buy and sell me a gazillion times over. I wonder if this is all it’s cracked up to be, teaching the young and famous in a deluxe trailer out in the Namib desert.
    
    Harper’s smirking in her chair. I can tell all she’s done is rename all of the triangles HAM. There’s no way she’s going to get through that workbook, a fact which is actually worse for me than it is for her. I’m about to say something to prod her along but my phone rings and I know the kids are wanted on the set, probably for reshoots. I don’t even bother to answer it. ‘Go ahead,’ I say. ‘See you tomorrow.’
    
    Harper is the first out the door. She leaves a half-eaten candy bar on her keyboard, the chocolate softening in the heat. Andy straightens up his desk, piles some papers in a folder before leaving. Brennan helps her mother wind up the extra yarn, then the kid pulls a sun bonnet out of her mother’s knitting bag and adultly ties it on her own head. She’s not even seven years old and already she’s mindful of sun damage. Neither she nor her mother say goodbye.
    
    The techie has the cover back on the AC. ‘Nice work if you can get it,’ he says, hefting his toolbox. I watch him walk out the door. I wonder who he’s talking about, me or them.
    
    Within minutes the place is an icebox.
    
     
    
     
    
    Though it’s the number one tourist destination in Namibia, there is absolutely nothing to do in Sossusvlei. I sit in my trailer with the door open drinking my second Windhoek Lager. The moon is starting to rise over the dunes. Bill, my roommate, is out doing whatever it is he does. Bill’s with the SPCA and has an ATV because he’s allowed to go anywhere on the set to make sure the animals are being treated okay. Bill’s a young Turk from Seattle and carries around more paperwork with him than I do. I once asked if I could look at some of the forms he has to fill out, but he hugged them to his chest and shook his head. Because I often pick his clothes up off the trailer floor, I know he wears a lot of stuff made from hemp. In the mornings before he heads out on his ATV, he rubs a block of salt under each armpit. In this heat, I’ve noticed it doesn’t seem to work. I’m not sure how we got paired up, but I’d rather room with Bill than with Peckham, the scarab beetle wrangler. The locals hired as housekeepers say Peckham’s trailer has more than ten thousand bugs in it.
    
    I finish my beer and walk outside. There are trailers everywhere, each one neatly lined up on a grid. FEMA eat your heart out. Nobody puts together a temporary city like a movie crew. After Katrina, the federal government should have hired one of the big Hollywood studios to build housing. Throw in some bonuses and there would have been mansions for all within a week.
    
    I slip off my sandals and sink my feet into the still warm sand. During location orientation Mac the Knife said to always wear shoes, especially at night, because of scorpions. Everyone knows all the dos and don’ts they tell you at those things are just for liability reasons. I light a cigarette and start walking. It’s hard to see any stars because of all the klieg lights they’re using two dunes over for a night scene. The generators are running at full capacity. At night anyone who’s not talent has to turn off their air-conditioning. It’s okay with me because the desert night is the best part of the day, the humidity just right, like a warm bath.
    
    The location is about a half hour east of Dune 45, the one you see on all the postcards. There’s a second location stateside in Wilmington but I’m not sure which scenes they’re filming there. I walk ten minutes to where the trailers end. Just over the next dune it’s so bright from the diffusers it looks like daytime. The Namib desert is the oldest desert in the world, the dunes among the highest on earth. During the sunrise the sands are lit a deep blood red, the landscape like something on Mars. A half hour before first light vanloads of tourists show up at Dune 45, have their pictures taken as they march single file up the crest. I hope I get a chance to go before the end of the shoot. Some of the best boys climbed 45 at sunset and said it was all that. The electrical guys always have a nose for cool stuff to do.
    
    Within a day of arriving on location the sand becomes your enemy. At the end of the day you can feel the grit in your teeth; at night in your bed it rubs you raw. It’s all the cinematographers can talk about, the way it scratches their lenses. Still, I like it here. It’s like living in a terrarium, like we’re all just part of one big happy ant colony. It reminds me of the prophets in the Bible living out in the desert eating nothing but locusts and honey. Already I think I’ve lost five pounds. There’s a real simplicity in desert living. At orientation Mac said Namibia’s population density is four people for every square mile. It sure beats Burbank. Burbank with the smog and the tremors and the brush fires and the beautiful women with their fake breasts hard as drywall. Out here at night I can forget the school. I can forget the three kids who collectively are worth fifty million more than me.
    
    I light another cigarette and climb the dune to watch. From the top I can see it’s mostly lighting and the dolly drivers laying down a track. It can take them hours to figure out how to shoot something. Charlie Brown is sitting in the second director’s chair, his big spherical head in profile like Alfred Hitchcock.
    
    I look at my watch. Right now it’s noon in LA. Christina’s probably in Century City at her acting class. She has a thing going with someone in the class – I think he’s Serbian. I know she knows I know. I look at my watch again. Maybe in an hour or so if traffic’s light, they’ll be back at our shitty little apartment in the valley clawing away at each other. I take a long last drag on my cigarette, flick it into the dune grass. Christina’s no spring chicken either though she looks great. She’s almost thirty, which means her big break better come sooner rather than later. Honestly my job is the only reason she sticks around. She thinks being with me gives her ‘access’.
    
    Sometimes I get invited to premieres. I can tell from the way she primps and preens, the tight dresses she wears from boutiques on Melrose, that she’s hoping to be discovered. The first time I took her to an opening I told her not to hold her breath. At Grauman’s Chinese Theater we had to go in the back way with the rest of the non-essentials.
    
    Something has left a track in the sand, a series of tiny footprints the size of dimes. What if I just stay here? It’s six rand to the dollar. Would anyone even miss me? Even my mother has stopped asking how the latest screenplay’s going. Now she just tells all her girlfriends in Phoenix I’m in the industry, production side.
    
    In the distance I hear an engine rev. Slowly it gets louder until I realize something is rumbling up the dune. I turn and see Rainer, the director, on an ATV, his goggles madly glinting in the light. Gorgeous is sitting on the back holding a boogie board, his face so rugged and chiseled it makes my heart pound unwittingly.
    
    ‘Hey, Teacher Man,’ says Rainer. ‘What’s shaking?’ Rainer is from some European principality and never calls anyone by their real name. He’s the reason we all call Charlie Brown Charlie Brown and Gorgeous Gorgeous. On Rainer’s left hand there’s a small MLO tattoo but one of the guys in props said it’s just for show, that a true Malibu surfer would never let a guy like Rainer join. Rainer pulls up alongside me and idles the bike. ‘Howdy,’ I say. ‘Surf’s up?’
    
    Gorgeous pounds the board with his fist. ‘Hella tight,’ he says, which surprises me because nobody uses that word anymore. His hair is streaked gray at the temples to make him look more fatherly. This is the third movie set I’ve been on with him. The first was a romantic comedy he did almost eight years ago, the second a heist flick. Every time I see him I still can’t believe a human being can be so good-looking. Even the union carpenters get giggly when he’s around.
    
    Rainer adjusts his goggles. They make him look like a World War I flying ace. ‘How’re things going in the classroom?’ he asks. Strangely enough the most powerful forces on the set besides Rainer are the SPCA and me. If Bill blows the whistle on animal cruelty, there’ll be hell to pay. If I flunk any of my charges, the flunkee has to stop filming immediately. It can cost a studio millions of dollars a week in delays until the kid gets it together. Most times it’s cheaper to just bring in a replacement and refilm the kid’s part.
    
    ‘Harper’s not going to win any Merit Scholarships anytime soon,’ I say.
    
    ‘She doesn’t need to,’ says Rainer. He winks at me, then puts the bike straight into fifth and hurls the two of them down the dune. I watch them head into the thrum of lights. I think about how if we weren’t here on location, this very spot would be quiet and peaceful, monastic. I think about how I’m almost fifty, my life a series of devaluations – from wannabe actor to wannabe director to wannabe screenwriter to this. I wonder if Rainer knows I’m being investigated. That the LA County Board of Off-Site Learning wants to ask me a few questions. Like why, in the almost one hundred shoots I’ve done in the last ten years, I’ve never failed anyone.
    
    In the distance, Rainer gets off the bike, walks over and rubs Charlie Brown’s globe of a head as if for luck. Suddenly Harper appears from the other side of the dune. I watch her stub out a cigarette, then step on Gorgeous’s board. For a moment she stands balancing precariously, her arms stretched out like wings. Then she bends her knees and silently rockets out of sight.
    
     
    
     
    
    When I get back to the trailer Bill’s already in bed. I can smell patchouli, see a two-dimensional version of Bill strewn on the floor – his khakis, his hemp shirt – as if he melted right out of his clothes. There’s an envelope lying on my pillow. Someone’s already opened it. It’s a printout of an email from Christina. Out here in the desert the non-talent doesn’t have Internet access though I sometimes use the kids’ laptops to check my mail. Otherwise messages are sent to a group address and then delivered to us. The print is light; the machine must be running out of ink. ‘Hey,’ it says. ‘I’m moving in with Slobodan. No hard feelings.’ There’s one of those emoticons at the end but the thing is composed of so many symbols it looks more like an expletive. I lick my fingers and reach over to extinguish the incense sitting in a small altar Bill has brought with him from Seattle. The thing goes out with a satisfying hiss. I pull on a windbreaker and swipe the keys off Bill’s dresser. Outside the moon looks like a hand grenade but without the pin.
    
     
    
     
    
    Ernst’s is a good thirty minutes away. I keep the ATV in second, enjoy the ride. Fifteen minutes out of camp I can see the Southern Cross and the Scorpion, the night sky littered with stars. Four people to every square mile. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad.
    
    I stick to the main track. If I went over the dunes as the crow flies I could get lost out here, end up like Ralph Fiennes in The English Patient, all burned and crispy. The moon lights up the desert, the sands mindless and vast. It’s like being out in the middle of the ocean at night. The way you realize how small you are, that the earth wouldn’t care one bit if something suddenly snuffed you out. I remember after Gordy, my agent, refused to even send around my second screenplay. ‘I got two words for you,’ he said. Through the phone I could hear him munching on something. ‘Move on.’
    
    I pass one of the giant dunes. In the dark it looks prehistoric. After a few minutes I begin to see fires burning up ahead. I pass a campsite and smell marijuana. Someone’s playing Bob Marley through a tinny radio. I wonder what they’d do if they knew some of the biggest movie stars in the world are just up the road. Maybe they wouldn’t care. Maybe the kind of people who trek all the way out here into the desert are beyond such things.
    
    I come to a fork in the road and turn left. Ernst’s is less than half a mile up the track. I pull in and cut the engine. The place looks like a little gingerbread house. For a minute I think I smell bratwurst. In the parking lot there are a number of ATVs and a couple of minivans. Ernst’s is too far for most of the crew to drive all the way out here since they might be needed on the set at a moment’s notice. Even the stuntmen prefer to drink out in front of their trailers where they swap crazy stories of freefalling off hydroelectric dams.
    
    I push open the door. The place is smoky and darkly lit. I walk in and for a second it’s like I’m back in the classroom. Andy’s sitting in a corner drinking a beer and talking intently with a beautiful dark-skinned woman, her head totally shaved. When I enter he looks right at me but doesn’t even smile. I see Harper sitting at the bar, her blonde hair tastefully pulled back in a tight bun. It’s only when I see Brennan holding a pool cue as she sips a scotch that I remind myself I’m in the land of the body double. On this movie, the doubles are uncanny – Brennan’s double puts down her pool stick and picks her cigarette up out of the ashtray where she left it. In the corner Gorgeous is playing darts. If I look closely through the smoky haze I can tell his arms aren’t nearly as ripped as the real Gorgeous.
    
    I walk up to the bar and order a seven and seven. The man behind the counter is wearing a Tyrolean hat and stands drying an enormous beer stein. He puts the stein down and makes me my drink. ‘Ten dohlars,’ he says, then adds, ‘you vit the crew?’ It’s like I’m talking with Schwarzenegger himself.
    
    ‘Yeah,’ I say.
    
    ‘It still ten dohlars,’ he says. That’s colonialism for you. I paw through my wad of colorful money and hand him fifteen. ‘Danke sehr,’ he grunts. At the pool table Brennan’s double makes an incredible shot.
    
    All the body doubles are at least eighteen, even Brennan’s. They all sign strict confidentiality agreements and often follow the star from one film to the next. The resemblance is usually pretty amazing but not so amazing you can’t believe they’re not twins separated at birth. Sometimes a body double is better looking than the star. If that happens, the double usually doesn’t last long.
    
    I take a seat one over from Harper. The real Harper’s already done a stint in AA. Before she broke into film she was a teen pop star. Her biggest hit was a song called ‘Lonely for You’. It’s true, I’m blue, and lonely for you. For three months you couldn’t go anywhere without hearing it. I take a sip and study faux Harper in the mirror behind the bar. Same pouty lips, same emerald eyes. Her face even holds the light the same way, her cheekbones chiseled like a deer’s. After a while I realize I’m staring. In my line of work I’ve seen plenty of doubles but this one is eerie. Like there’s been a rip in the time space continuum. This woman sitting here at the bar could pass for Harper in a court of law.
    
    ‘In case you’re wondering, I dye my hair,’ she says suddenly. Her voice is husky, more scratchy than alluring. I wonder if she has a cold.
    
    ‘Excuse me?’ I say.
    
    ‘When I’m off the set, I dye my hair brown,’ she says, tucking a loose strand behind her ear. ‘People still bug me for autographs, but not as much.’ She’s wearing a navy cardigan and drinking the tiniest glass of wine I’ve even seen, the thing practically the size of a thimble. ‘Remember last year when the paparazzi got that shot of her without panties?’ I nod. It was all over the web, the story made even more bizarre by the fact that Harper had shaved her pubic hair into the shape of a cross. ‘Everywhere I went people kept throwing underwear at me,’ she says, letting a stream of air out through her pursed lips. The bartender comes over, refills her glass from an elegant looking bottle. ‘Danke,’ she says, barely taking a sip.
    
    ‘Bitte,’ he says, walking away.
    
    Faux Harper smooths one of her eyebrows. ‘You’re her teacher, aren’t you?’ I nod and wonder how old this girl is, if she’s over twenty-one. ‘I feel for you, I really do,’ she says.
    
    ‘Why?’
    
    She shoots me a look and I settle on my bar stool. ‘Don’t you ever feel like you’re going to explode?’ she says. ‘You know, from keeping it all inside, all the things you’ve seen her do and have to keep to yourself?’ She takes another sip, her pinkie extended in the air. ‘Once, she made Kim, her assistant, buy a bunch of suppositories but evidently she didn’t read the box. She comes up to us and says, “How are you supposed to swallow these things?”’ Faux Harper bends over and mock pounds her head on the bar a couple of times. Her laughter is surprisingly deep. ‘Ah,’ she finally says, wiping her eye. ‘It probably would’ve killed her, and I’d be out of the easiest job in the world.’
    
    ‘Here’s to the easiest job in the world,’ I say, raising my glass. I’ve often wondered about body doubles, if the work makes you feel like a star in your own right or if it’s as boring as it looks. They stand in for the star as the crew sets up the shot. Basically they need someone to stand where the star will stand so they can figure out details about lighting and sound – how high to place the boom, which side of the star looks better from where. Faux Harper could make real money doing nude scenes for Harper when Harper comes of age.
    
    ‘Speaking of losing the easiest job in the world,’ I say.
    
    ‘What? You?’ she says. There’s genuine concern in her voice.
    
    I order another drink and tell her about the Trigonometry unit Harper needs to pass. I tell her about the LA County Board of Off-Site Learning and how when I get back they’re going to strip me of my license. I tell her about Harper’s bank account. I tell her about the time I saw Harper lying in the dunes making out with one of the twenty-something producers. Talking to her is like talking to a stranger on a plane – I can’t seem to help myself. I consider telling her about Christina and Slobodan, but I decide this isn’t about me. It’s about Harper and how she can’t even calculate the area of a perfect triangle.
    
    ‘We should do something,’ faux Harper whispers. In the corner I see faux Andy leaving with the beautiful bald woman, a small pile of pink bills heaped on the table.
    
    ‘Like what?’
    
    Faux Harper takes a slow sip. For a moment I think she is Harper. From the length of her neck to the small green vein bordering her hairline – it all seems to add up to Harper. For the first time all night I notice there’s polka music playing on the stereo. Behind us faux Brennan is dancing suggestively with her pool cue. Faux Harper studies my face for an eternity. I wonder what she’s looking for. I sit quietly and keep my mouth shut as I’ve learned to do around movie people. Finally faux Harper speaks, enunciating every syllable. ‘I don’t think there’s much of a future in being Harper,’ she says carefully. I know what she means. Nine times out of ten today’s teen star is tomorrow’s reality TV contestant. Most of the kids I’ve ever taught on location are out of the business. ‘I’ve been thinking about it for a while. Sometimes the non-talent,’ she says, pointing to the two of us in the mirror, ‘needs to cash in.’ She sits quietly letting her words sink in. I finger a razor bump on my cheek. She asks if I know anyone at the tabloids.
    
    ‘Tabloids?’ I say, as if I’ve never even heard the word before. I don’t want to admit it, but yeah, I have a few business cards from gossip mongers stashed away in my wallet for a rainy day.
    
    She takes this for a yes and leans over, lays out the plan. I listen to everything she says. Am I capable of this? I wonder if faux Harper is drunk, if this is something she’ll just laugh off tomorrow. When she’s finished, she orders us two shots of an aged South African whiskey. ‘To non-talent inheriting the earth,’ she says, hoisting her glass. Faux Harper puts hers back like she’s drinking water. Mine burns all the way down.
    
    In the corner someone screams. Faux Gorgeous has hit a regular in the shoulder with a dart. I grab my keys from the bar.
    
    ‘Wiedersehn,’ says the bartender, and pulls a small first aid kit out from under the counter.
    
     
    
     
    
    The next morning Andy is already in the trailer by the time I arrive. He’s in full wardrobe, wearing period clothes which are carefully stained as if he were traveling a thousand miles through the desert. Gently I put my briefcase down on my desk. ‘Morning,’ I croak. My head is throbbing. I feel like one of those cartoon characters who hits his thumb with a hammer. I can practically see the hurt lines radiating out, my head the epicenter.
    
    Andy lights a cigarette. Brennan and Harper aren’t scheduled to be in today. Andy gets kidnapped by a spice caravan early on, so his role isn’t as big as theirs. Sometimes when the girls aren’t in the two of us sit chain smoking and reading Hamlet out loud. Andy’s just finished writing a persuasive essay about whether Gertrude’s a sympathetic character. His paper’s pretty good. He takes an actorly approach to it, claiming there’s no such thing as a totally unsympathetic character, that it’s the actor’s job to find the one glint of humanity in them.
    
    I walk around the trailer and close all the curtains. I wonder who would play me in the movie of my life, what glint of humanity they might find.
    
    Andy offers me a cigarette. There’s a world map up on his computer screen. ‘You think people will be able to tell this isn’t the Sahara?’ he asks.
    
    ‘What?’
    
    ‘You know, like movie goofs.com. We’re filming Tea in the Sahara in the Namib desert. You think people will know? Like maybe they’ll look at one of the camels and say, “That’s a sub-Saharan camel, not a Moroccan camel.”’
    
    I think about last night and faux Harper whispering in the dark, her plan simple yet elegant. ‘People will see what you want them to see,’ I say.
    
    ‘I guess,’ says Andy.
    
    I open my briefcase. There’s still the stain left over from where Harper spilled her coffee on it. I pull out an essay test on Hamlet, hand it to Andy. ‘It’s open book,’ I say. ‘Feel free to use the web.’ The first question says, ‘Is Hamlet an anti-hero? Why or why not?’ In my briefcase there are four cans of warm beer. I hand one to Andy, then sit back and pull out my camera. It’s a state-of-the-art Leica R9 with both an analog and digital system. I bought it last year before I went to Mongolia on a shoot. On the LCD screen it says I’ve taken a total of fourteen pictures.
    
    I pop open a beer, look at my watch, let a stream of smoke out through my teeth. I know how this must look. I flip through the camera manual. I can feel another door closing in my life. Outside a siren blares. It means they’re filming. I pick up the camera, look through the viewfinder. For a second all I can see is my own eye.
    
     
    
     
    
    According to the plan I’m supposed to be in position by four in the afternoon. I keep my camera in its case in my bag and take the back route through the props tent. At this time of day there’s hardly anyone around. I pass a huge animatronic camel they built just for Brennan. At one point she’s supposed to ride through the desert all by herself to get help. Lloyd’s wouldn’t insure her for the scene, so they built this thing. Looking at it, I’d rather take my chances with a real camel.
    
    I turn a corner and come to the area on location where the talent lives. Their trailers are doublewides, each one with a satellite dish cupped on the roof. Gorgeous has two doublewides which somehow have been joined together. The thing is probably at least a thousand square feet. His assistant say he spends most of his time in there reading, but nobody here believes that. Finally I see Harper’s trailer. It has a purple awning and two chairs out front. I don’t have to be too close, so I walk to the end of the doublewides and climb a small dune.
    
    I pull out my camera and settle in behind the crest. It’s not quite four. Within a couple of minutes I’ve already managed to scratch my lens. God, the sand really is terrible. I try to remember what the devil tempted Jesus with in the desert. I can feel myself baking. I pull out a bottle of water and wet the back of my neck. The devil said something or other about bread, something about casting yourself down and letting the angels bear you up.
    
    I hear an ATV revving over the sand. I look through the lens. It’s faux Harper, right on time. She’s wearing the same calico dress Harper wears, her hair also in a period style, her face also bruised from Harper’s fall off a camel in scene fifty-seven. I snap some shots. She opens the trailer door, steps inside. I’m almost a football field away but there she is on the LCD screen clear as day. She stands in one of the windows and gives me a thumbs up, though I can tell she can’t see me because she’s looking at the wrong spot. Faux Harper turns and begins poking through the kitchenette. She’s looking for Harper’s stash. Turns out Little Miss Sunshine likes to a do a line of coke now and then. Surprise surprise. Suddenly Faux Harper stops her snooping, flips open her cell phone. I see her talking. She walks back to the window and holds up her index finger, signaling for me to wait.
    
    I watch her leave the trailer, hop on her ATV and roar off. I lie back. What was the third temptation? Something about dominion over everything. It’s weird how I remember what Satan said but not what Christ did. For a moment I doze off. Then I hear the ATV coming back. I raise my camera.
    
    It’s faux Harper again. She heads straight to the kitchenette and pulls out a small Hello Kitty bag from a drawer. On the kitchen table she lays it all out – mirror, straight edge, straw, a baggie full of powder. I snap away. Faux Harper keeps a straight face but I wish she’d slow down though I guess she’s right to hurry – we don’t want it to look staged. Then faux Harper puts the straw in her nose. I blaze away. This shot could be worth a million dollars. To my surprise she snorts the line right up, throws her head back, tears forming at the corners of her eyes. I rack my brain. She didn’t mention taking it this far, then again, she didn’t mention not taking it this far. I guess that’s why she needs the money. I put the Leica in rapid mode, take five shots a second.
    
    I hear another ATV coming down the track. Inside faux Harper quickly repacks everything, shoves it back in the drawer. Outside it’s the twenty-something producer, the one I saw Harper making out with in the dunes. He gets off his bike and heads in. Faux Harper is lit up like a rocket, her pupils blasted wide open from whatever she just hoovered off the table. The producer puts his arms around her and they begin to kiss. They lie down on the small kitchen table, and when the producer pulls the calico dress over her head, I see it inked in red and gold on the small of her back – a skeleton key tattoo. Harper’s trademark. It’s really her.
    
    On the viewfinder I watch and consider. Somehow it doesn’t look real. Maybe the lighting’s wrong, or maybe it’s grotesque the way real sex is.  The fact that the producer just unzips his pants while Harper’s totally naked makes it seem even seedier. I could maybe get three million for these. I advance to nine shots a second. I tell myself this is just a joke, something I’ll tack up later in Harper’s trailer just to freak her out. Her face is twisted, the bruise on her cheek shimmering in the light.
    
    When they’re done, they share a cigarette. Harper’s hair is a mess. She’ll have to go back to make-up. I start to repack my camera. That’s when I notice Brennan sitting behind me half-way up the dune. She’s wearing her sun hat and holding a plastic shovel. For a moment she’s just a little girl playing in the sand. Then the light shifts, and I see those blue eyes. The kid is looking at me like she’s seen it all before."

    "text": "It is strange to devote so many hours to a saint. She has never fully believed in them, nor their stories. Haunting pillars, abiding in the wings of triptychs, for a long time she regarded them as secondary characters, part of the choreography of an important scene to which they are witness but, for the most part, not essential. To her mind, a rock is only ever a rock. A wheel, a wheel. But there he is, a solitary man in the wilderness. A wilderness that’s intransigent and unyielding but also malleable, accommodating the saint’s needs, inner and outer, the rock with which he beats his breast magnified by the geological formations behind him and their mysterious silence, the inscrutable blue of his eyes echoed in some expanse beyond. And there he is again, in his wood-paneled study: pensive, silent, contained. He is, after all, the most scholarly of saints, often depicted as a humanist figure absorbed in inquiry and translation.

    Ever since she was young, she has collected images of Saint Jerome. It started with a postcard a friend once sent her, a painting by a Frenchman with the improbable name of Jean-Léon Gérôme: an intimate scene of the saint and lion immersed in a deep sleep. The saint rests his head on the lion’s flank, and a hand on its hind paw. The animal is relaxed, its vigil suspended. Apart from the absolute trust between the two species, she was struck by how soiled the soles of the saint’s feet appeared to be, as though he hadn’t washed them in weeks. She taped the image to her kitchen wall. And bought the next postcard she found, and the next. After a few years the wall was covered in images – postcards, mainly, but also a few magnets – of Saint J, as she had started to call him. She knew it was absurd but sometimes, alone in her study with her own whiskered conscience by her side, she felt a kinship across the centuries. A quick glance was all it took to note her preference for scenes where the lion was present– without the lion, the saint’s story was more psychodrama, a man and his struggle with no elegant or endearing third party – but even when Saint J was alone, the lion was everywhere.
    
    Museum posts came and went. Six books, two houses, four cats and one dead husband. Late one night while riding the bus home through a desolate patch of city, fighting the sensation that nothing lay ahead of her and everything behind, an idea visited like a rapping at the window: she would curate one final exhibition. After many back-and-forths, her proposal was accepted. A summons was issued across Europe and overseas, a call out for St Jeromes. Most hung in public collections, others in private, some in churches and monasteries or in the dark oblivion of a storage space. In a year’s time, they would all be packaged into crates and brought to Madrid by human couriers.

    The flat they have given her is one street from the museum. From her terrace she can see its roof. This way she can come and go while the show is being installed. Every evening she goes out onto the terrace and smokes a cigarette, and for its duration she gathers her thoughts. She often smokes half or a third, each tasting more sepulchral than the last, and puts it out in a flowerpot. Just a bit more thought-herding and then she’ll quit. For now, she’s too aware of the ideas born from the fumes and head rush.
    
    Autumn has settled in, the evening pulls at her sleeves, but she hardly notices. She packed the wrong clothes, assumed Madrid would be warmer than London. In the distance the words palace hotel in fiery pink add temperature to the skyline. Her thoughts return to the museum and she thinks of the endless rows of paintings, at that hour unseen. She moves abstractly through one wing and then another, lingering here and there, until arriving at the medieval section. That’s where the ghosts, were there to be any, would reside, convening in the Romanesque chapel or swimming in the otherworldly blue of the walls. Her dead husband would be there too, jumping over the cordons and pressing his face to one of the gold-leafed panels, yes, once liberated from all constraints he would have relished the freedom and not cared whether he ever came too close.
    
    Still far off in thought, she steps inside and slides closed the door to the terrace, draws the curtain. Her reverie is soon interrupted by the sound of someone walking, in heels, in the flat overhead. The hanging lamp is disturbed ever so slightly.

    On an earlier visit she had drawn up a map of the exhibition. It would have four sections, St J’s life parceled out like the panels of an altarpiece.
    
    Section one: St J’s importance within a historical, intellectual and biblical context.
    
    Section two: St J as translator in his study (room, cabinet, cell, scriptorium).
    
    Section three: St J as penitent in the wilderness (desert, grotto, exuberant landscape).
    
    Section four: the lion, pulled into greater focus– like Saint George’s dragon, it appears in all sizes, and with a range of expressions (fierce, plaintive, quizzical).

    At the Corte Inglés she fills her cart with food she knows she will never eat, jars and jars of olives, grilled peppers and artichoke hearts and enough crackers for two. The activity relaxes her and is far less arduous than its sequel, which involves carrying the heavy bags over her shoulders through the Puerta del Sol, hurrying her steps towards the quieter side streets. She wonders whether anyone at the museum has noticed her melancholy or detachment. Perhaps they assume she’s wearing the weather of her native country, clothed in it so fully she’s unable to shed even the outer layers when abroad. A friend told her that whenever she felt a stab of self-pity she should add ‘n’ to ‘widow’ and remind herself that even within the monolith of loss there’s at least one view out. When she returns to London she will start anew. Will finally go through the clothes that have been hanging, untouched for years, in the wardrobe. But for now, no parallels: no penitence, no wilderness, no animal companion.

    In the narrow entrance to the exhibition they will hang a timeline. It is important not to offer too much, only the essentials, in order to avoid overcrowding.
    
    347 AD: birth of Eusebius Hieronymus Sophronius in Stridonia, Dalmatia (near modern day Ljubljana)
    
    At the age of twelve, he goes to Rome to study grammar, rhetoric and philosophy. He visits the catacombs often.
    
    In 360 he is baptised, most likely by Pope Liberius.
    
    As of the age of twenty, he embarks on a more nomadic lifestyle. He travels to Bethlehem via Antioch and Alexandria.
    
    In Antioch he suffers a crisis of faith and writes what is probably his first text, De septies percussa, Concerning Seven Beatings. In mid-Lent 375 he has a life-changing dream, in which he’s brought to a tribunal before the Lord and accused of being a Ciceronian – that is, of preferring the classics (pagan literature) to Christian writings.
    
    He prays and fasts in the desert of Chalcis, and learns Hebrew from a Jewish convert. He then acquires Greek.
    
    A quarrelsome man with strong opinions, he disagrees with others on certain ecclesiastical and theological matters. He quits the desert and returns to Antioch, where he is ordained a priest by Bishop Paulinus in 379.
    
    Summoned back to Rome, he becomes papal secretary to Pope Damasus in 382. He devotes himself increasingly to scholarly investigations of the Bible and translation. He preaches the importance of the monastic life and condemns the hypocritical lifestyle of the clergy. He falls out with many of his colleagues. After Damasus passes away, Jerome heads for the Holy Land in 385.
    
    In the Holy Land he meets Saint Paula, a wealthy, widowed nun. His fortunes change. He joins Paula’s virginal entourage including her daughter Eustochium in a pilgrimage through Egypt and Palestine. He becomes their spiritual advisor.
    
    In Bethlehem, Paula erects a monastery to Jerome and his followers. Another one is set up for the nuns. Apart from the occasional journey, he will spend the rest of his days here.
    
    One day a lion limps into the monastery. The other monks flee. Jerome examines its paws and discovers a thorn in the left one. He extracts the thorn. (As a saint versed in translation, he is also adept at interspecies dialogue). The lion becomes his constant companion.
    
    From 391 to 406 AD, he devotes himself to the translation of the Bible into Latin.
    
    Jerome also writes many letters. He is concerned with the morals of women and is a strong believer in their chastity.
    
    He dies on 30 September 420. It is Saint Paula who closes his eyes as Jerome is lain out on the marble slab.
    
    St Jerome enters the popular imagination thanks to Jacobus de Voragine’s Golden Legend, a medieval best seller, and then voyages through the Renaissance, a figure and an iconography endlessly recast. Erasmus of Rotterdam described him as a river of gold.
    
    After the Counter Reformation, his significance shifts from that of intellectual to penitent, hence the two distinct ways in which he is portrayed.

    What, then, of the lion?
    
    They say he guarded St J’s tomb day after day, refusing to eat, until he eventually joined him in the afterlife.
    
    Thoughts on the lion:
    
    The lion often has a human face. Or that of a carved fountain. Sometimes its expression is so human, one wonders whether it is meant to convey the saint’s innermost thoughts. Alter ego or altar ego, depending on the situation. Sometimes it is dog size, or cat size, or even smaller: a chess pawn or salt cellar, ready to leap onto the saint’s lap and disappear into the folds of his robe.
    
    What do people look at first, the saint or the lion? Nearly always the saint, yet just to confirm it is him they quickly search for the feline signifier nearby.
    
    Alongside the saint it appears docile, placid, subjugated, submissive. In contrast to the restless saint, who is always active, either beating his chest with a rock or buried in books in his study. He hardly ever sits doing nothing, doesn’t practice acedia the way other saints do.
    
    The lion hovers, crouches, rests, lingers, paces, nearby, a verb, a noun, an adjective, to the saint’s existence. As vigilant as grammar, it sometimes naps with its eyes wide open.
    
    At the monastery the monks demand that the lion work for its daily sustenance. Jerome orders it to guard the convent donkey on its trips to fetch firewood. One day the lion wanders off into the desert – every now and then it must, after all, give in to its animal nature – and leaves the donkey unguarded. In that brief window of time, the donkey is seized by robbers and sold to a caravan of merchants. The lion returns to the convent alone. The monks assume it has eaten the donkey. The lion is ordered to atone. This means more work. The lion obeys. One day it spots the donkey in the caravan and brings the entire gang to the monastery to prove its innocence. We do not know much more about the donkey other than that it trusted the lion and seemed to regard it as a friend.
    
    She is not the first to wonder what really happened to the lion after the saint’s death. Does the animal indeed waste away or dematerialize back into myth? As though its very existence hinged upon the saint’s recognition. In the Carpaccio fresco the lion is already relegated to the background as the monks pray over St J’s lifeless body, his head resting on a stone.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    And what of Paula?
    
    In paintings she appears far less frequently than the lion. And yet she too was a crucial figure in his biography.
    
    By some accounts, Paula not only encouraged Jerome to translate the Bible but financed the enterprise. Along with supplying money and motivation, she is said to have edited the work, copying it and making corrections along the way. As patroness of the Hieronymites, she created a haven for these monks to lead the cloistered, scholarly lives they sought. And yet out of the forty-five paintings in the exhibition, not one of them features Paula. A terrible oversight, which dawns on her too late.

    There are few amenities in the area where she lives. Only the local Chinese convenience shop and one selling costly fruit, as sumptuous and elusive as the bunches of glass-green grapes that hang around the corner from Velázquez’s crucifix, each in near or total darkness. She is thankful for the canteen, where she has lunch most days and tests her Spanish. After a year of online classes she can understand the gist of most sentences, and yet some museum staff speak too fast to decipher what they say. It depends on who is talking. A few days ago, for instance, a curator spoke about the Treasure of the Dauphin, a collection of rock crystal and hardstone vessels, many in the shape of fantastical creatures (aquatic, airborne, grotto-dwelling) from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. At the top of a dark flight of stairs in a dimly lit room, where the elliptical display and departure from the rectangular make everything more mysterious, is this, the museum’s own cabinet of curiosities. A ‘sanatorio de joyas’ the curator called it, and she agreed there was something convalescent about this crystal menagerie, not to mention many of the pieces had custom-made leather cases with velvet or silk lined interiors, and it was only when he repeated his phrase that she realised he’d said ‘tanatorio’.
    
    Death stalks many a conversation. On another occasion, she listens to an art restorer describe two galgos he’d seen hanging from a tree in the countryside, that was how hunters disposed of their dogs once they were no longer of use to them. She’d glimpsed many of these slender, timid greyhounds being walked around the streets of Madrid, individuals lucky enough to be rescued in time and put up for adoption, far more fortunate than their lifeless counterparts, hung so that their feet just brushed the ground. The restorer illustrated this with a movement of his hand across the surface of the table.

    On the floor above, another exhibition is being installed and will open shortly before hers. She goes by to watch it being mounted. The Lost Mirror it is called: representations of Jews and conversos in medieval Spain. She watches as two men place a Haggadah from the British Library in a vitrine and then seal it hermetically. Some walls have only labels, others already have their paintings in place. From afar she’s drawn to the little theatres of ritual, often enclosed within a fantastical architecture, but upon moving closer she sees auto-da-fés and desecrated hosts. Some works are self-evident in their malice, in others she has to search for the bearded figure who subverts the scene.

    At home, her awareness of the floor above leaves a different sort of incision. She hasn’t slept well since she arrived. Her neighbor paces at one in the morning and resumes at seven. Her neighbor seems to always be home. She can trace their path from room to room, knows the moments the person is at rest (few) and those when he or she is in motion. The steps suggest a woman in heels, but one can’t draw any conclusions. One day soon, when she’s feeling assertive, she will go up and speak to them. If her husband were here, so jaunty and uninhibited, she would have sent him at the second instance.
    
    From her terrace she can see the little figures of men hammering at the museum’s dome. She hears them, too, the sound soothing and constant, a gentle pattering much less intrusive than footsteps, and imagines the workmen hammering directly above the Goya painting of an injured mason. How strange it would be if, over two hundred years later, they were right above their historical counterpart. Another note to self: go investigate.

    Quill, vellum, tallow. Along with his companion, St J’s work materials all hailed from the animal kingdom. She is ever more attuned to the animals in the museum. They offer a different dimension of experience. Dogs, horses, birds, lions, apes. She views them as only that. For her they do not embody kings, critics or clergymen. In front of Goya’s dog she listens to an exchange between two elderly German women. “Ein Hund, ein Hund,” says one. ‘Ganz hilflos’, says the other. Goya’s dog. Why does she, and the rest of humanity it seems, always end up in front of it? The caption in Spanish reads ‘Perro semihundido’. In English, ‘Drowning Dog’. In Spanish it is half submerged, in English, condemned, its fate sealed in this leap between languages. A mysterious shape looms in the nebulous space into which the dog gazes, like a master acquiring substance. If the shop were to sell an hourglass containing a tiny figure of this dog, would it be placed in the top half, with the sand draining away, or in the bottom half, slowly immersed?

    In the cafeteria late one afternoon she encounters an elderly man eating a slice of lemon cake. She smiles at him as she sits down with her tray. That is enough of an encouragement, and from the table beside hers he tells her about his day looking at Bosch, how the Bosch paintings with their mischievous grotesques remind him of friends from his adolescence, his monologue launched with The Garden of Earthly Delights, after admiring it for so long in books it was a thrill to spend hours in front of it, and at some point he even saw a moth fly past the painting and a guard rush over and clap his hands and miss, which was just as well since it really did seem as though the insect had emerged from the triptych and was perhaps very ancient, if you zoomed in you’d probably see it had the face of a mouse or a demon, and he tried to guess which panel it might have emerged from, Eden or Hell or the teeming garden between? His monologue then moves on to the Adoration of the Magi, another triptych in the room, smaller but also magnificent, he says, with all those enigmatic faces staring out from gaps in the roof and the walls, and he especially liked the handsome donkey, but the moth didn’t seem interested, and a little later he noticed it in the vicinity of the Haywain triptych, where Hell is an ongoing project, still under construction… Bosch was a magus, the man went on, he saw the pensive faces of deep-sea creatures centuries before ocean navigation and recognised the splendours of mutants before hybrid experimentation, and the ways in which man could create hell on earth, long before the birth of nuclear energy. The world is full of wonder. But we destroy ourselves.
    
    After expressing these thoughts the man pauses to blow his nose and, just as he is about to resume, an elegant woman appears with two large shopping bags from the museum gift shop. Judging from the way she puts them down and leans over to straighten his tie, she is his wife, and after ensuring the tie is hung at the right angle she mentions they have spent the day with Velázquez and Murillo and Zurbarán, this is their first time in Madrid and they thought they’d begin with the Spaniards, they have yet to see Bosch but would try to arrive early tomorrow to avoid the multitudes, had heard that room got particularly busy . . .
    
    As she speaks her husband begins folding his napkin, he folds it one way and another, and then tucks it under his dish. He drinks from a glass of water, sets it back down. His wife says she’s just going to nip back to the shop to get one more scarf. She leaves the two large shopping bags on the seat beside him. After she goes off he doesn’t speak again. Had his imagination created this mythical day with Bosch, had the anticipation been so great, had his thoughts rushed ahead of him and conjured this whole experience before it even took place?

    In his essay on Old Age, Cicero observes, ‘Old age has its appropriate weapons: namely, the study, and the practice, of decent, enlightened living’. Keep the mind active, and the body too, continue as best you can the pursuits of earlier days. He describes the pleasures of spending time with others – but in the end, he writes, the human spirit returns to live within itself.
    
    She wonders whether reading Cicero not only added colour and nuance to St J’s Latin prose but provided him with wisdom and insight for his own twilight years, no matter how fiercely he later tried to distance himself from those writings.

    There is one work she is still waiting on. All the others have been confirmed and are in different stages of arrival. The painting she is hell-bent on having is highly unusual: it’s the only depiction, as far as she’s aware, of Saint Jerome present at the Annunciation. As though eavesdropping. There he is, a skinny spectral figure in white, hanging around in the background, with lion nearby. What is he doing there, privy to this intimate moment? After several exchanges with the Venetian family that owns the painting, it remains unclear whether they will agree to lend it.

    In the museum shop she buys two glasses cases. Both are adorned with dogs, one golden yellow and the other mired in yellowness. One is Goya’s half-sunken dog, the other a poised, regal hunting dog painted by Velázquez. She will use the confident hound for the pair of glasses she wears when out in the world and the anguished dog will be for her reading glasses, the ones she slips on when she’s going to write, even if she has since learned that there were originally two birds in the sky, two birds on which the dog has set its sights, Goya’s painting therefore perhaps not quite the expression of despair, not quite that iconic image of anguished modernity, that she and most others had imagined, and yet its expression still captures the unease, the existential circling she does, each time she sits down at her desk.

    She can decipher the newspaper headlines at the kiosk. The agitated chatter in the canteen. In her flat, she listens to the radio while she cooks. There is unrest in the city. Tensions within and between political parties. Talk of an amnesty. As she settles down for a quiet supper the footsteps overhead begin again and the lamp to sway a little. The steps are soon accompanied by the sound of furniture being moved, as though the person were wearing heavy Dutch clogs from another century and, just to make sure she can hear it, has started dragging farm equipment across the room. She lays down her fork, puts on a sweater.
    
    All this time she had imagined someone younger, someone kept awake by fear and excitement of the unknown, but the door opens to reveal a woman in her mid to late sixties, her grey hair pinned up in a raggedy fashion. In the palm of one hand she holds a tiny pile of cold cream. A small white dog runs out from behind her, stops at the elevator and starts to yap. (Strange she’d never heard it). For an instant the dog and the cold cream seem made of the same substance.
    
    ¿Sí?
    
    Now that they stand face to face, all the phrases she’d rehearsed abandon her. Apart from a summer’s German, she has always been poor at other languages. And yet she quickly spots the culprit: paisley slippers with chunky heels, like loafers.
    
    ¿Sí? The woman asks with more emphasis.
    
    Instead of replying she makes a walking gesture with her middle and index fingers, tracing a path in the air.
    
    Insomnia, she says, drawing out the word.
    
    The woman nods excitedly.
    
    Sí, sí, she exclaims, insomnio, and taps her forehead.
    
    But she hasn’t come searching for communion. She wants to explain that she hates the thought of this shared affliction, hates someone else adding foot notes to her night. But the words escape her. It’s the woman who is in command of the situation. And just to show her, she summons her dog with a high-pitched whistle. The animal bounces back down the corridor and into the flat, a white fluffy thing full of energy, in fact it seems to contain all of the energy that’s been drained from her night after night, the restorative sleep she so craves, absorbed by this fluffy white thing upstairs, and once the dog is inside, the woman holds up the cold cream in her hand – she must return to her ablutions – and says buenas noches before closing the door.

    The storage rooms are an immense catacombs, with paintings of all sizes hooked onto tall sliding racks and row upon row of statues with identification tags hung round their necks, all lingering in a state of latency and expectation. Some paintings haven’t seen the light in years, perhaps a century, and are in need of a long visit to the restoration wing. Others move between above and below. The art handler helps her scour the massive sliding racks. The paintings are arranged with little coherence, subordinate to scale rather than artist, period or theme. That afternoon she unearths nine Saint J’s, all residents of that other wilderness, the dormant collection.

    One of the hazards, she knows, of working with a saint, is the steady demystification. Scholars have suggested it was not even Jerome who had the fateful encounter with the lion. She closes her ears to those conjectures. Regarding the life of a saint, who is to say which scenes are real, which fabrication? She imagines him in his study. He must have had such a sharpened sense of purpose. Did hunger or distraction ever enter, or a monk with a query, or an impertinent fly?
    
    She struggles with the captions, little feats of compression, and with the introductory texts for each section. She must also finish the catalogue essay. It’s much easier to break down another life into captions than your own and yet reducing any life to 75-word segments requires a certain mercilessness. Be merciless, she tells herself as she pours a second glass of wine and rings another friend in London. You should go out more, they say to her every night, but she sticks to her tiny radius. The quill on the page, the needle used to extract the thorn: each carved a path inwards and outwards. A widening of life. As for her own, her impulse is to narrow it.

    On the first Friday of November she travels to Valladolid. The weather grows colder as the train cuts through deep Castile and it is chilly in the compartment. Valladolid is an impenetrable town. Streets vacant, a claustral air. At the sculpture museum she visits the two St Jeromes that will soon travel to Madrid: a magnificent altarpiece, illustrating key moments in the saint’s life, and a small wooden relief of him in the wilderness with the lion. At the monastery she studies with morbid fascination the baby Jesus dolls in the vitrines, the maternal instincts of nuns passionately channeled into these combed, swaddled things, somehow reproduced in the rows of ornately topped sandwiches at the tapas place where she stops for lunch.

    The Prado houses many St J’s. In the end, she returns rather guiltily the nine she had pulled out from storage and keeps to the original four from the permanent exhibit: the Georges de la Tour in seventeenth century Tenebrist style, showing the saint absorbed in the reading of a letter, the two halves of the red seal-like stigmata. Then a José de Ribera, emotion wrought from the saint’s aging muscle and vivid red tunic. And one of the two Marinus van Reymerswaele’s, by far the witchiest, the saint’s webbed hands like aquatic creatures scuttling across the table. On a shelf behind him a crucifix looms over a mostly spent candle, its stilled drip echoing the folds in the loincloth. And of course Joachim Patinir’s glorious saint and lion enfolded by deep blues and greens and jagged rocky formations, with other little dramas unfolding in the distance.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Many of the art handlers have been working at the museum for decades. Some have back conditions and can no longer do heavy lifting. Two of the younger men have just moved the Patinir from room 55A to its place in the show. It looks a little off kilter, the rocky formations at even more of a tilt than usual. One of them pulls a spirit level out of a deep pocket in his overalls and holds the instrument to the top of the frame. He nudges the painting two millimeters to the right.
    
    The handlers excuse themselves to attend a staff meeting. She will use the free hour to visit the Goya cartoons, paintings made as preludes to tapestries, which live in a light-filled tower. As soon as she enters the first room she spots The Injured Mason, slumped in the arms of colleagues who carry him away from the construction site – from such a height, his survival doesn’t look promising. Contrary to her suspicion, there are no live workmen hammering at a dome above.
    
    Her eye fixes on a long, narrow, rectangular painting around the corner. It depicts a showdown between two cats, one black and the other striped grey. They stand face-to-face on a patch of brick wall, a fragment of a dilapidated ruin. It is impossible to tell how high the wall is, how large the ruin, whether it is dawn or dusk. Did one cat chase the other up to this spot or did they meet there? No one else is around to witness their encounter.
    
    Backs arched, fur bristling, ears pinned back. Each pair of yellow eyes expresses a different emotion, pupils wide or dilated. The grey cat bares its fangs in defensive mode, its lifted paw almost like a hoof. The black cat cowers and yet it’s the grey cat that has nowhere to go: if it takes a step back, it will fall off the wall, while the black cat can easily backtrack (behind it are a few descending steps). Yet it appears the more fearful and apprehensive. The sky behind the black cat is overcast. Behind the grey cat, luminous. Between the two animals a sprig of ivy pokes out from the brick, a feeble gesture of truce, faint against the light.
    
    At home that evening with a glass of wine, she examines a postcard of Goya’s cats and imagines that if one were to tilt the long painting this way or that, the weight of everything in the museum would shift.

    There has been further unrest in the city. Marches and banners, a sea of red and yellow flags, and an incandescence that at night smashes car windows and sets fire to rubbish bins. Sirens blare at all hours. Voices carry from dozens of streets away. Up until now she has dwelled at a comfortable remove – this is not her country, not her city, not her politicians – but the proximity of the sounds, encroaching on her home as she stands on her terrace, begins to disturb her.

    She returns to the other exhibition to see how it is advancing. Today the technicians are busy hanging a large triptych, adding garras and durmientes, claws and ledges, to the top and bottom of the frame. In another room two curatorial assistants adjust the height of a wedge on which rests the head of a marble statue. The measurements sent were a little off, the head is raised too much, they will have to shave off a bit of the wedge. She assumes the recumbent statue is of a saint lying in eternal peace after a life of martyrdom, but no, it’s a robed inquisitor.
    
    The oddest item in the exhibition is the Cristo de la Cepa, the Christ of the Vine, a coarse segment of trunk that resembles the figure of Christ. According to legend a Jewish laborer was working in his vineyard when he came across this peculiar figure with reddish roots sprouting from his head, beard, ears, groin and armpits. The man interpreted it as a sign and converted to Christianity, then donated it to the archbishopric of Toledo, where it became an icon in the seventeenth century, held aloft during festival processions in a special little case, people praying to the tiny Christ as they begged for rain. The powers of the man-root were deactivated in the eighteenth century when the Age of Enlightenment removed its charge, and [the] rain was seen to fall regardless. Donated to the cathedral of Valladolid, it became one of many objects demoted from icon to curiosity. She would like an oddity like this one in her show. How long does it take, she wonders, for a thorn to decompose?

    She can hardly believe the news, has to reread the email: the elusive painting is on its way from Italy. The family has finally agreed to lend it. There is just enough time, since they can rush it through; loans from private collections are free from the bureaucracy of large institutions. It will travel from Venice with a member of the family.
    
    That night she celebrates with an additional glass of wine. She’s on her terrace when she hears loud yelling in the distance, angry slogans flung into the dark sky alternating with the blare of sirens. She lights her cigarette and taps the ashes into a flowerpot. All of a sudden she sees clouds of smoke rising from the north face of the Prado, there by the Goya statue, and imagines a correlation between the flowerpot and the museum, that she has somehow set the museum alight with a tap of the cigarette. But no, it’s the protestors, they have gone and set fire to the building. She imagines masterpieces going up in smoke, can’t recall everything that hangs in the wing – the Poussins, and, even worse, the Titians. She rushes indoors to scroll through her phone until finding the name of the one Prado person she knows for certain will be awake at that hour. He sounds surprised to receive a call from her. She tells him the museum has been set on fire and he must alert security. Two minutes later he rings back. His voice is calm. He has spoken to the head of security. The clouds of smoke come from the climatisation wing, which gives off vapour at night, and what she has seen was nothing more than the museum exhaling. She’s not the first to have raised the alarm; a few times a year, people ring the bomberos. He thanks her for her vigilance and wishes her a good night.

    The woman is carrying a bag of groceries from the expensive fruit shop, her white dog on a tensed leash at her side. They cross paths outside the building. The woman stares at her and says, insomnio. This time she pretends not to hear the word they both inhabit.

    First the dome of his head emerges into view, then the mercurial eyes and the long meandering beard. Two handlers delicately remove the thick blanket that served as buffer between crate and statue. A shawl of bubble wrap is cast from his shoulders. It is a magical moment when the artworks start to arrive, their crates like orphaned Lego blocks, their primary colours indicative of country or museum. Some paintings and sculptures she has already met in person. Others she only knows from reproductions and no matter how much she has studied them, they contain a surprise: more sheen or patina, the saint’s expression gentler or more tempestuous, the lion more assertive or withdrawn.
    
    Among the Saint Jeromes she has convened, each has his own personality. The earliest are eleventh to fifteenth century manuscript pages from France and Flanders. Few depictions show him young or even middle-aged: in both desert and study, he is usually old, bearded and bony.
    
    The three from the Thyssen-Bornemisza – the Titian, the Master of Grossgmain, and the Bartolomeo Montagna – only had to cross the street. A Hans Memling has arrived from a private collection. A splendid Stefan Lochner from the US. The Cranach, from Vienna. The Colantonio. A Caravaggio. A Domenico Ghirlandaio. A Rubens. She fought for three jewels from London’s National Gallery: the Antonello da Messina, the Vincenzo Catena and the Dürer (soon to be joined by the Dürer engraving of St J in his study from the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin).
    
    It is late afternoon and she is standing with a technician and the head of temporary exhibitions trying to decide how close to hang the Titian and the Lochner, such different evocations and yet each brings out something in the other, when an assistant approaches. The courier has arrived with the artwork from Venice, she says.
    
    At the entrance stands an old man with a large package, bound up like a mummy, resting against his leg. Someone must have helped him in. Stooped, brittle, dressed in a tattered suit that was probably once quite elegant, the man says something in Italian, then Spanish, and, seeing her still struggling, in choppy English. Sorry it has taken so long, he says…
    
    Usually young people are sent as couriers, not individuals so timeworn they can hardly lift the work themselves, and yet when they shake hands she is struck by the softness of skin unacquainted with labor. Two technicians relieve him of the painting, place it on a nearby table and start to unwrap it. The man oversees the process.
    
    Here it is, the painting she’s been waiting for. She looks past Mary and Gabriel to the small figure at the back, sitting on the steps of a classical temple, leaning his head against a marble pillar. The crucifix and book lie in his lap, the skull nearby. A few steps away stands the lion, its head bowed and tongue unfurled as though in thirst or exhaustion. In fact, both look as though they’ve reached the end of a long journey. Painted in feathery white strokes, this is the most spectral St J and lion of them all.
    
    The old man watches the painting being hung on the wall, its hooks already waiting in place. From this moment onwards, no one else must touch the work until its return.
    
    Slowing her steps to match his, she gives him a cursory tour of the rooms. He only stops twice to inspect a painting – the Caravaggio and the Cranach – and once they reach the end of the show he mentions he hasn’t eaten since leaving home.
    
    She thinks of a wine bar on the corner, popular with museum folk. There’s a table at the far end. After a brief consultation they order wine and a cheese board. The man removes his coat and collapses back into his chair somewhat theatrically. It must have been quite arduous to bring this painting all the way from Italy, she says, sensing his wish to convey the immense effort. Oh yes, he replies, and goes on to explain that only after many hours of deliberation did they decide to lend it but no one could be bothered to come to Madrid, and they also refused to entrust it to anyone outside the family, so he took it upon himself to accompany this painting that had hung in his home since he was a child, even though he had now caught up with the age of the saint.
    
    The waiter reappears with a carafe of wine, two glasses, a cheese board and a breadbasket, lays everything out and departs.
    
    Now that the man sits across from her, she studies his face. She has always preferred landscapes to portraits but finds herself drawn to faces that resemble landscapes and to landscapes that resemble faces. This face is more of a landscape: deep-set eyes, a mountain ridge of a nose, thin lips like a forest parting. His features are sharp and only faintly softened by age. And his clothes smell strongly of pine – she imagines a large house encircled by dense garden – yet his face wears no vegetation.
    
    She stares down at his wrinkled hands, now cupping the glass of wine, and recalls their smoothness as he returns to the matter of the journey. He won’t deny it was difficult, he says, especially the ride on a gondola with the painting propped between his knees. As the gondolier steered them towards the train station they were rocked by a funerary gondola, it came so close their boat was sprayed with canal water, and he’d thrown himself over the painting to shield it despite knowing it had been very well wrapped. It wasn’t so much the water but the fact that this funerary vessel and its aura had passed so closely by, and he could even see the expressions of the mourners who, had they given it any thought, would have been surprised to see a man frantic about an inanimate object when they were there bidding their mortal farewells, but he had to guard it with his life. Apart from not eating he hasn’t slept either since he was too nervous to nap on the train and couldn’t let the painting out of his sight, you never know who might be lurking in a carriage nearby, so tonight he will stay at a hotel and in the morning catch the train home.
    
    Their conversation turns to the work itself. She’s thrilled to include the only instance where St J is present at the Annunciation, she says, topping up each glass. No, he’s just dreaming he is there, says the man, he really isn’t. He is there, she says. No, he’s dreaming it . . . He only imagines himself at the scene, can’t you see by the way he is drawn? Like the dream he had about reading Cicero? She asks. No, that dream he disowned later in life, he says. Erasmus said so himself. It hadn’t been a dream at all: Jerome really was punished for reading Cicero. It was not something he dreamt. But here he is dreaming he is present at the Annunciation.
    
    She doesn’t want to hear more and changes the subject. Tells him about how at the opening of the Saint Francis of Assisi exhibition at the National Gallery live wolves were brought in, and she would like to find a lion for hers. She pictures it sauntering up to the Puerta de los Jerónimos, scattering the guards like the monks at the monastery.
    
    She then tells him about the Saint Jeromes starting to arrive from around Europe and beyond, the daily tasks, the captions and the catalogue essay, the fantasist who spoke to her about having spent the day with Bosch. She tells him about the unrest in the city and the night she saw plumes of smoke rising from the museum.
    
    As she speaks the man tears apart the bread and dips chunks in his wine and eats them in loud, sloppy succession. She’s not sure how much he understands but that frees her tongue even more, and as she speaks she feels herself growing lighter and lighter like one of Poussin’s helium-filled puttis, pausing only to down more wine. Most of the cheeseboard sits neglected. But the sips have turned to swigs, and as she embarks on the subject of the woman upstairs and her white dog that has absorbed all of her energy, her eyes start to well up. Keep a lid on things, she tells herself, this really is too much, but she unravels. Something has unlocked. But only momentarily. After a minute or so of losing her composure she reins it back in.
    
    All this time the man has been wearing a silk scarf, midnight blue and pocked with cigarette burns or possibly moth holes, and he now removes it and leans across the table to pat the moist area beneath each of her eyes. This gesture of intimacy, brief and unexpected, is followed by an uneasy silence, which she meets by waving over the waiter and asking for the bill.
    
    The meal is over. They stand up from the table, released from the moment. Someone else will have to finish the cheese board. Outside the restaurant she offers him her arm, which he gladly accepts, and then offers to walk him back to his hotel. It is Thursday night and the bars spill out onto the streets, the pavements filled with revelers. Every now and then, especially when in the vicinity of loud groups, the man grips her arm more tightly.
    
    From closer up the fiery pink letters of the palace hotel she has seen from her terrace seem less gaudy, almost alluring. In the hotel lobby he doesn’t let go of her arm and he now leads her. They do not speak in the elevator or once in his room. No, no, he says when she starts to unbutton her dress. They climb into bed with only their shoes cast off and very quickly fall into a deep sleep. She hasn’t slept so deeply in months, or beside another body in years, and she dreams of a lion on which she rests her head, rising and falling with its breath, instead of a man she dreams of a lion and instead of her husband she is reunited with all the cats from her past, multiplied and magnified, a large collective rumble from the afterlife channeled through the giant purring beast.
    
    But time and space return, and at some point in the morning her dream is shattered by a group of men who come charging into the hotel room. There’s only four of them yet they have the volume of a mob and for a second she thinks they are protestors who have stormed in from the street. Yet these men don’t have flags. And they have only one focus: the old man beside her. Two are well-dressed, the third wears a uniform, and the fourth, well, she is never certain who he is. The two well-dressed individuals lift the man from the bed and one picks up his shoes as they explain that their father has brought the painting to Madrid against the family’s will, they knew he was concocting something but it never crossed their minds that he would fill out the paperwork and sail off in a gondola with this rather unwieldy heirloom, who knows how he managed to carry it onto the train, but in any case, they are sorry, well, actually they are not sorry, but rather must inform her that they have already collected the painting from the museum and will now bring it back, along with their father, to Venice.
    
    She is silent as they take turns speaking, their English more fluent than their father’s, who is propped up between them like a bewildered ragdoll. She longs to go over and tug him free but remains at a distance, thankful she never undressed the night before. As he is led out of the room the man looks back at her and in his face she sees something like exhilaration.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    She dispatches her headache with coffee, a shower and four paracetamols, and then heads from home to the museum. There is an empty space where the Annunciation had hung. She must rethink that area. For the first time she feels the gaze of every St J, her movements tracked by sixty old men, sixty old men caught between the vertical and the horizontal, as she buttons her coat, which doesn’t shield her from the collective scrutiny.
    
    She is glad the other exhibition exists, something against which to measure her own. Five men in overalls are busy hanging a life-size crucifix of polychrome wood, Christ’s body covered in painted wounds supposedly inflicted by Jews, torrents of blood spilling from a gash in his right side. The sculpture dangles from a thick green rope, attached to the top of a small forklift that slowly moves it backwards and forwards, up and down, animating the Christ as the handlers seek out the right height from which to hang it. A durmiente is installed under its feet. Once the crucifix is fastened to the wall, another man holds a spirit level to Christ’s outspread arm. Or rather, to the straight wood of the cross to which his hand is nailed. There it is again, the spirit level, and he continues to hold it there, the bubble at the centre sensitive to the slightest of tremulations. He is measuring the spirit level. She feels her face start to flush, she feels her coordinates vanish, she doesn’t know what she feels, and she hurries out of the room, no longer trusting the equilibrium."

    "text": "We went to Iceland, me, my sister and our parents, like six weeks before they got divorced. I was almost twenty back then and my little sister Maggie was eighteen. I was self-conscious and androgynous and Maggie was very beautiful and troubled. I didn’t really get what her troubles were about, or what the meaning of her struggle was. ChatGPT said that beautiful eighteen-year-old girls might be struggling with social and emotional challenges, jealousy and friendships, online harassment, body shaming, toxic relationships, safety concerns, strict parenting vs. independence, and being underestimated academically, but none of those seemed quite right for my little sister Maggie. I looked at her over the tables of the Icelandic restaurants, over the plates of cold fish or whatever it was. I don’t really remember what we ate, but I do remember one thing: the cows’ heads, skin all dried out, flaking off the bone. There’d be a horrible white cavity where the ear should be, a white-rimmed hole with red inside and I never knew if the white was a bone or some massive, thickened vein or something, white with pus or with the build-up of some other clotted waste product. I don’t mean to be rude about the food. But the cows’ heads really made me feel suicidal, the mouths half-open. Were there teeth inside? The eyes looked shut because the eyes had been cut out. What did the base of the head look like, the place where the neck should have been? I had to stop myself from looking, I badly wanted to look but I knew that if I looked I’d have to see, and I didn’t want to see, I only wanted to surrender for a moment to the urge to look . . .

    I watched as Maggie saw the heads. She shivered, then her eyes glazed slightly over. She was tuning out the heads. I thought I couldn’t do it, make my eyes glaze over, tune things out. I thought I didn’t have Maggie’s dispassion, yes, I thought I was so passionate. I thought it was impossible for me to tune the heads out but of course it was perfectly possible.
    
    Our parents had strange, fake-seeming arguments that week. They argued about the news, about news items from years ago, Brexit and tariffs. They argued about if it was fine for me to be a vegan and not eat the cod liver oil that the hotels gave us at breakfast but I was almost twenty years old and nobody was about to force cod liver oil down my throat. I almost wished somebody would, not my parents, someone else, a stranger, I wanted someone to care enough to really do something to me. Our parents fought about the cod liver oil and about Maggie’s predicted A-Level grades which were obviously perfectly fine. The arguments seemed contrived and performative. But what roles were our parents performing, and why? Me and Maggie walked behind them, looking at the amazing dead volcanoes of Iceland, the crashing white waterfalls, the foul-smelling sulphuric springs. I tried to work out if Maggie was worried about the smell, if she thought that it might stick to her clothes and follow her around or something. Maybe later, when she took her clothes off, she’d put them in a plastic bag to try and contain it, stop it seeping out and contaminating all her stuff. But she didn’t seem worried at all. Maggie wasn’t vain, she was just beautiful. Maggie Sophia Harrington: what was she going to be? I watched her ponytail swing behind her, side to side, as she walked ahead of me among the craters.
    
    Me, I wanted to be a great writer of autofiction. I’d graduated high school that summer and I planned to spend my ‘gap year’ writing. But my life was so boring, there was no way it was ever going to work. Iceland had seemed promising, because it was Nordic, which sounded like Norway, the land of great autofiction. But it was boring here, the only special thing was the landscape but I wasn’t interested in describing that. The sunken blue lake at the bottom of the crater where a volcano had erupted 10,000 years ago: it was beautiful, it filled me with awe and with a weirdly thrilling feeling of destructive potential (was it perhaps the desire to die?), but I really didn’t care about describing it. It was better to just see it, to actually look at it, or to look at a picture of it, and it was easy to find pictures, anybody could do that, just type ‘crater’ into Google. I guess I wasn’t cut out for literary stardom. My parents stood behind me, arguing about whether Maggie and my expensive educations had been worth the money and about whether it was worrying that both me and Maggie were mentally ill and needed therapy and medication and didn’t seem to be getting better. It was all a bit much for me, to be honest.
    
    ‘Jane,’ Maggie said. It was funny that my name was ‘Jane’, the most generic female name, a female placeholder, and old-sounding, classic and ‘elegant’. . . I turned around. Maggie looked stunning against the grey clouds and the mist of rural Iceland. She wore sparkly eyeshadow and slightly sparkly blush and it shimmered on her clear smooth skin. She was so young and I am ninety-nine percent sure she was a virgin just like I was. She looked cold, she was shaking and she seemed pretty excited about something.
    
    ‘Yeah?’ I said.
    
    ‘I’m going to be in a movie,’ she said. ‘I mean I might. They’re still deciding.’
    
    ‘Who?’
    
    ‘The director. Or producers. The production company.’
    
    ‘How come?’ I said. ‘Is it for school?’
    
    ‘No, no, it’s Hollywood. It’s LA.’
    
    Probably she was lying. Maggie had some psychological problems which were supposed to cause lying. ‘Symptoms: Lying,’ the NHS website actually said about one of Maggie’s many alleged mental problems. I don’t say ‘alleged’ to dismiss her, I just mean that Maggie got labelled too much by doctors. She was just a troubled girl, I think. But what did I know? ‘It’s LA,’ I repeated and my heart was racing in spite of myself. A thousand songs about LA and California started playing in my head. I loved four or five different songs called ‘California’ and at least ten that mentioned LA. Everything I loved was American except for one or two Nordic things. I was obsessed with America and especially California and I guess Maggie was too.
    
    ‘That’s amazing,’ I said. ‘Congratulations.’
    
    ‘Thank you,’ she said.
    
    She said the movie was about some teenage sisters who kill themselves.
    
    ‘It exists,’ I said. ‘The Virgin Suicides. It already exists. It’s very famous.’
    
    She said the movie was a remake of The Virgin Suicides.
    
    ‘Weird,’ I said.
    
    ‘The Virgin Suicides is so good,’ Maggie said.
    
    ‘I know,’ I said. ‘It’s super good.’
    
    Maggie got me to take photographs of her beside the crater, so that she could send them to the adults who apparently cared about her out there in Hollywood. She looked ethereal. She kind of did look like somebody who might die young for tragic reasons, one of five doomed sisters. Maggie took her coat and tracksuit bottoms off and maybe I should have felt protective or worried about what was going on but I didn’t, not at all. I felt disturbed and quite enchanted. Maggie was wearing M&S kids’ underpants with the word ‘Tuesday’ written on them in pink cursive. Was she wearing those by accident or had she planned all this? In fairness she looked totally amazing. She let her hair down and it fell over her shoulders and all down her back. She took her jumper and her T-shirt off. Where were our parents? I looked to the horizon and I looked down into the crater: they were near the centre and I couldn’t see their faces. I could barely even tell them apart from up here. I needed new and stronger glasses. Maggie had small perfect breasts and frankly so did I, I knew I did. Nobody had ever seen them but I didn’t need anyone else to tell me how nice they were. Maggie took photos of me in all my clothes: it would have seemed contrived to take them off. It would have seemed imitative and therefore humiliating, even though I knew that I looked good. I kept my denim jacket and my jumper and my trousers on and Maggie said I looked like the young Donna Tartt. She was a sweet little sister, kind and thoughtful with great cultural references.
    
    ‘Thanks,’ I said. ‘That’s so nice.’
    
    ‘Please don’t tell anyone about the movie,’ she said.
    
    Who did she think I would tell? I never told anyone anything. I was a true teenage loner. I was reclusive. I was an artist, almost. I was the twenty-first century’s answer to Holden Caulfield, or maybe Esther Greenwood. Was it possible that Maggie was about to become famous? Me and Maggie were both smart, progressive, anti-capitalist people, and we were both quite rational, I really think we were, but we were secretly obsessed with fame. We never talked about it, it was just obvious. Both of us wanted to be known, to be known very deeply by somebody who would love us, to be witnessed by strangers, to be seen on screens across the nation, to be in the papers, to be profiled in New York magazines.
    
    ‘I was a cipher when I was young,’ I’d tell the magazines. ‘I was a symbol, I was nothing, I felt I had no soul. I couldn’t speak because I had nothing to say. I had no personality. I was less than an absence, I was a black hole, that’s how I saw myself, it was a scary feeling, it was very dark . . .’
    
    I wanted to tell the magazines about my difficult thoughts and to be seen as interesting because of them. I wanted to be seen as a talented amazing person with a dark and complex heart. I didn’t know how Maggie wanted to be seen but I knew she really wanted it, she badly wanted to be seen, I think she wanted to be famous even more desperately than I did. Me and Maggie didn’t want to die unknown and for a moment, instead of just standing there, I wanted to take her in my arms and hold her as our parents slowly and silently walked up from inside of the dark core of the crater.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    In Reykjavik me and Maggie shared a hotel room and in the evenings she had to practice acting. To be honest I don’t think she was very good.
    
    ‘The trees, like lungs, filling with air . . .’ she kept repeating to the mirror in a sentimental and nostalgic tone. Why was she speaking so nostalgically? It wasn’t a nostalgic line. Had Maggie even read The Virgin Suicides? I’d read it twice, at age thirteen and then again at age sixteen. Did Maggie even know that The Virgin Suicides was based on a book?
    
    ‘Just say it like you normally would,’ I said. ‘Don’t say it like that.’ But Maggie couldn’t improve, she wasn’t capable. She never changed, that was part of her problem. I tried to write a more naturalistic script for her to practice with, but writing scripts was as impossible as acting was. People only ever said banal things that looked idiotic on paper, and any meaningful lines I added seemed so contrived. What was the point of speaking? It was all kind of bullshit. It was totally banal. That holiday everything seemed banal. Our parents had taken us to Reykjavik but it felt exactly like Brighton or something, only with incomprehensible words in foreign characters on all of the street signs and shopfronts. There were record stores and vegan cafes and pavements painted with rainbows. Our parents argued about if trigger warnings were bad for universities and about what would happen when our grandparents died, whether me and Maggie would get some of their money, or just our parents and our aunts and uncles. I closed my eyes and tried to walk in a straight line by keeping the left side of my left foot against the curb of the rainbow-patterned pavement. I kept my eyes closed so that I could think clearly about movie producers. I pictured movie producers sat somewhere and watching me, watching me walk along the pavement, they would think that I was perfect for the role, for any role, but mostly for the lead role in The Virgin Suicides with all my youthful anxiety, my self-consciousness. I was pretty, I looked kind of like Maggie but I also looked like a boy, I hid my body which just made it more desirable, it was a secret, it was my secret with the wide open deserts of California, the country clubs, the palm trees, whatever else there was out there and when I opened my eyes it was snowing, the snow was falling thickly on the rainbow-painted ground and children were jumping up and down and making memories. I was practically twenty, I had a ton of memories already. I knew snow and I knew winter, I knew joy and I knew childhood, I knew failure, I knew emptiness, I knew I hated myself even as I worshipped and fetishised myself and my body. What the hell was going to happen to me? I put my headphones on and played some great, timeless and famous American music. I caught Maggie’s eye and she smiled at me, then she turned away and I was left listening to Bob Dylan through my headphones, listening to him ask me how it felt to be all on my own.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    After a while the movie started to seem real. Maggie stayed up late, sat in the bathroom taking meetings on her laptop. When I snuck up to the door I could hear a bunch of American people speaking about The Virgin Suicides. They spoke about how to make the new The Virgin Suicides adaptation feel different from the old one. They said the girls’ innocence felt contemporary and the aesthetics of the original movie felt contemporary too, so how were they supposed to make something new? These were the sorts of questions the producers discussed, or the writers or directors or whoever they were. What the hell was Maggie doing there? She didn’t say much in the meetings. She barely said anything. It was all super weird. I lay on my back in the single bed beside Maggie’s empty untouched bed and heard the muffled voices of American adults through her laptop speaker.
    
    ‘We all agree we want to make it dreamier, more surreal. I think we should really lean into the sisters’ perspective.’
    
    ‘Right. In the original, we see them mostly from the boys’ point of view, and what if we turn that inside out? Show the world as the girls see it: warped, distorted, suffocating.’
    
    ‘Detached, like they’re already fading before they even die.’
    
    ‘The key is making the audience feel trapped with them, right?’
    
    Was this really how movies got made? It all sounded quite fake to me. It sounded pretty dumb. I walked towards the window and stared out into the dark night of Reykjavik. I wanted Northern Lights or some more fucking snow, I wanted to be amazing, I wanted to be unforgettable, I wanted to be a genius, I wanted to meet somebody who thought I was a genius, some producer or agent or professor, I didn’t care who. I put on Maggie’s gingham Urban Outfitters bikini and I looked like a model with a perfect figure. I think it’s okay to say that. I hated myself, I really did, but I looked totally amazing in Maggie’s teen girl bikini. I left the bedroom and I went to the hotel pool. It was closed and so instead I sat outside for ages in the hot tub looking up at the black and hollow sky. The bubbles gathered round my body, the bubbles clung to me, they wanted to be close to me, the warm and quickly dying little bubbles, they all loved me and my body. Who in the world was going to love me most? Did my parents love me more than anyone else ever would, or would I meet somebody who loved me more? Had that person been born yet? Would any famous people love me? These all seemed like the wrong questions. They seemed close to the real questions, which were deep and philosophical, and related to my own hidden nature, to my life’s internal core and to the meaning of the future. But I couldn’t work out what those questions were.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    In our twin beds the next night, Maggie asked me what I thought her boundaries should be for the movie.
    
    ‘What do you mean?’ I said.
    
    ‘Like nudity, violence, sex . . .’ she said.
    
    ‘Isn’t that something you’re meant to decide yourself?’ I said. ‘I don’t know what your boundaries are. What sister would you play?’
    
    ‘Lux, they think,’ she said. Lux was obviously the best character, the main sister, Kirsten Dunst.
    
    ‘Okay,’ I said. ‘Well, she has sex and dies. So obviously you’d need to be fine with those things. Sex and then dying.’
    
    ‘They all die. Lux doesn’t die violently. She suffocates. She asphyxiates.’
    
    ‘Okay, then you need to be fine with sex and nudity but you don’t need to be fine with violence.’
    
    ‘Should I be fine with self-harm?’
    
    Maggie was starting to piss me off. Why should I care if she was fine with doing fake self-harm for a Hollywood movie?
    
    ‘Up to you,’ I said. ‘What does Peter think about the movie?’ Peter was Maggie’s psychoanalyst.
    
    ‘He thinks I should have more boundaries for it,’ Maggie said. ‘Boundaries on nudity, self-harm . . .’
    
    ‘Okay,’ I said. ‘I trust Peter.’
    
    What sort of person would have boundaries in a situation like this? What sort of girl wouldn’t want to go as far as she could, as far as people would let her go? A girl owned her life and her body, really these were her only two possessions, and she could do whatever she wanted with them. What sort of beautiful girl wouldn’t want to give away everything she had, her body, all her thoughts and feelings, everything, because finally she was allowed to give those things away and put them out into the public sphere, so that the other people had to deal with them and they weren’t just hers anymore? Obviously, having a life and a body was way too much for one person to carry. What kind of girl didn’t want to sacrifice herself completely, to surrender in the name of ‘art’, to lay everything totally bare out there in Hollywood? I didn’t say this though, I tried to be a good big sister. Sweet, respectful, kind and sensitive. I don’t think Maggie even cared about how nice I was being. At dinner she ignored me completely, she made herself as beautiful as she possibly could and then ignored me the whole night and made eyes at built and handsome Icelandic men while our parents fought about the American government. Maggie would make her boyfriends crazy someday. Probably she made Peter totally crazy and that was why he told her not to show people her body for the movie. Sorry, but it really might be true. I’m afraid to say I think it was quite likely.

    Now it was time to go to a different part of rural Iceland. This holiday seemed way too long, but I was fine with it, it was good to be isolated in a bleak and unknown landscape in the last days of my nineteenth year. Me and Maggie had separate bedrooms this time, the house we were staying in was huge and futuristic, built out of iron and thick triple-layered glass. How much money were our parents spending on this trip? It was all starting to seem a little sinister: the length of it, the cost, the different properties, et cetera. Even then I had the vague feeling that the trip was meant to mark something, some kind of ending. There was a heated pool and I hung my long legs into it and thought of Bret Easton Ellis, I thought of Less than Zero, I thought of luxury, corruption, violent crime and California. Our parents were fighting about euthanasia in the living room and I sat by the pool playing the saddest ‘California’ songs I knew, Lana del Rey’s ‘California’ on repeat and then the Warren Zevon song about walking down the sidewalks of LA. At night I went to Maggie’s room and tried to listen to her meetings through the door. I couldn’t hear anything. I walked into the garden and I stood outside her windows in the freezing cold and there I could hear everything. Maggie was speaking, was she trying to ‘act’ again? Her voice sounded confident and pretentious, kind of arch.
    
    ‘They’re trying to escape themselves,’ she said. ‘But they also want to understand. And they know they’re young, they understand their power, of course they fucking do.’
    
    I felt the wind against my face and neck and on my ankles and my wrists which my pyjamas left exposed. All of a sudden I didn’t want to be listening to Maggie anymore. Instead I listened to Lana del Rey beg some man to open her up and fuck her to death. Was that what I needed? To be opened up like that? I wasn’t sure. How was I supposed to open myself up at all? I could try drinking and I went into the kitchen. I saw the liquors in the cabinet, red liquors glinting in the darkness. I saw the knives inside the knife rack. I saw the garden through the layers and layers of glass and in the garden I could see the pool, deep blue and gleaming, hungry, beautiful, American. Who in the hell was Maggie speaking to? I poured some liquor in a glass, I wanted it to taste of cherries, artificial sweetened cherries, summer, childhood, not our childhood, pretty childhoods from television, from the Disney Channel which we weren’t allowed to watch, not ever, we watched Švankmajer movies. I wanted it to taste like sports days which we lost at every time, me because I couldn’t understand my body, I couldn’t master it, and Maggie because she couldn’t handle the crowds and being witnessed which I could also relate to, or maybe I wanted it to taste like aestheticised teen suffering, Euphoria, whatever, I didn’t even care, but it was just some normal whiskey. Heavy, smoky, nothing like Maggie. I went back outside to look at the window of my little sister’s bedroom.
    
    ‘They know they can play with the boys’ perceptions,’ Maggie was saying. ‘They enjoy it, playing with it, seeing where it goes. But there’s this emptiness that’s underneath that, right? They know they have that power but they don’t even care very much. Not Lux. She barely cares at all. To her it means, like, less than nothing. It’s worthless. It’s worth shit.’
    
    Was Maggie drinking tonight too? Was she drinking the same whiskey as me? She sounded drunk. My little sister . . .
    
    I stared ahead into the iron wall of the bedroom, its cold form dark against the sky, blocking out stars. I stared into the wall as if somebody might come out from inside of the wall and say, ‘Jane?’ What did I want them to say? I wanted somebody to say my stupid name and hug or kiss me. I was a conventional person, Jane Theresa Harrington . . . I wanted to be famous and successful and for men to love and notice me . . . I wanted a new life . . . I wanted to die . . . I wanted to die and be reborn . . . I could hear creatures in the bushes but I had no idea what sort of creatures lived round here. Wolves? Possibly rabbits? It was dark, too dark to see.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Nothing even happened after that. The movie had nothing to do with me and then it didn’t get made. Either it never existed or it ended up happening without Maggie. There never was a remake of The Virgin Suicides, I don’t think. Or not yet. I don’t really understand what happened. I guess nothing happened. Nothing happened to us out there in Iceland. Nothing happened to me back when I was nineteen. And yet somehow most nights when I’m trying to fall asleep I see the cow heads, the white waterfalls, I see our parents in their raincoats, faces blurred because of my bad eyesight. Or no, that isn’t true. I just see Maggie, always Maggie in her knickers by the crater where the magma was at some point in the Earth’s distant historic past. I see the magma bursting through, splitting the ground and streaming out in rapid torrents. There’d be a crater, after that, and over time the wind and air and intermittent rains and the footfalls of the humans and the animals would deepen it, they’d deepen the depression. Then the depression would be very deep. Held at its centre would be me and Maggie, and people might circle us to take our photographs, they’d start out close and then get further and further away inside their helicopters. In my head there’s nothing, just silence and darkness, me and Maggie side by side. We define the image, we form its core, we are the heart of it but nobody can see us and we cannot see each other, we can’t even see ourselves. We can only feel the ground beneath us, hard and dry, and made of stone."

    "text": "The day didn’t start well. I was going to be evicted for non-payment of rent and I had a fight with my girlfriend.

    I said Why don’t you put the lids back on jars properly so they don’t come off when I pick them up?
    
    She said You think you’re so political but it’s all just meaningless crap.
    
    I said I don’t really think your paintings are any good, I just say that to make you feel ok.
    
    She said Of all the people I’ve slept with you’re the most dull.
    
    I said I wish we were both dead.
    
    She said Goodbye.
    
     
    
    I sat there a while. I sat there a long while.
    
    Right, I said to myself, I’ll go out.
    
    Walking down the street I checked my phone. I had an email telling me I’d got the job. I’d got the job. I wouldn’t be evicted. I’d begin to get somewhere.
    
    I wanted to tell my girlfriend but I didn’t.
    
    I kept on walking. The sun was out.
    
     
    
    I decided to go and see my friend whose brother just died in an accident. He was on holiday in France and he fell off a roof.
    
    I said Is it ok just turning up?
    
    He said The thing is he’s in heaven.
    
    Ok I said.
    
    I don’t feel too bad he said because it must have been very quick and of course he’s in heaven now, he’s in bliss and he wasn’t when he was alive. And I do miss him but life’s quite short anyway so I’ll soon see him again.
    
    Do you feel you’re in touch with him? I said.
    
    Yes he said he’s watching over me just like when we were little and he was my big brother.
    
    That’s great I said, that’s amazing.
    
    Yes I’m surprised myself how ok it is he said.
    
     
    
    I went on down the street. I saw a homeless man I sometimes give money to.
    
    He said Hey good news. I’m getting housed. Not in a hostel, I’ve got a flat.
    
    Very good news I said. How did that happen?
    
    Haven’t you heard he said there’s a new government policy, get people off the streets by next week, double universal credit and build thousands of low-rent council flats. Oh and stop rich foreigners buying up places and not living in them.
    
    I said What? Really?
    
    Yes he said it’s a complete turnaround. Like the boats.
    
    What’s with the boats? I said.
    
    They’re going to let most people stay he said. They’ll have a proper system. I don’t know the detail but check it out. And I hate to ask he said but
    
    So I gave him the change in my pocket and on I went.
    
     
    
    My phone rang. Was it my girlfriend? No.
    
    My friend said Guess what? About my brother.
    
    What’s happened? I said.
    
    Turns out he’s ok he said. He didn’t die at all.
    
    I said Wow how that’s amazing news.
    
    He said Yeah, seems he was just knocked out and his friends panicked and sent the wrong message, he just broke his leg but not badly, he’s completely fine.
    
    I said So he’s not in heaven.
    
    No he said but this is better.
    
    Of course I said. You can both be in heaven later.
    
    Exactly he said.
    
     
    
    So the day was looking up. I went to the park. I liked the bare branches. The clouds and blue sky were rushing through.
    
    I suddenly had one of those I can’t find words for it one of those moments of joy I suppose it is.
    
    One of those.
    
    They don’t last but they’re good when they happen.
    
     
    
    I went to see my mother. I hadn’t been for a while and she’s not well. I didn’t mention about my girlfriend.
    
    She said I’ve got some news. I had a scan result this morning and the cancer’s gone.
    
    Gone? I said. Like in remission?
    
    They said there’s no trace of it she said. It’s not at all likely to come back.
    
    I gave her a hug. I picked up her favourite vase and waved it in the air and shouted.
    
    She said Careful with that. She said Thinking about dying and my life I thought about ways I failed you.
    
    I said You didn’t.
    
    She said Of course I did. Like when you had chickenpox and I was working and you were looked after by the neighbour with the scary dog.
    
    I said I wasn’t scared of the dog.
    
    Well she said lots of small things and I’m sorry. Just let me know any time if you’re feeling wronged.
    
    Thank you I said. I don’t expect I’ll need to.
    
    I just thought I’d say she said.
    
     
    
    We were having a cup of tea and a biscuit and the news was on.
    
    The news said Israel had stopped bombing Gaza and pulled out of the West Bank. There was going to be a big reconciliation and a complete rethink.
    
    I was speechless.
    
    My mother said That’s another then.
    
    What? What else? I said.
    
    You must have heard about Ukraine she said. They’ve stopped fighting and they’re sorting it out. And I think there’s something about Darfur. Everyone seems to be changing their attitude she said. Like they’ve cancelled the poor countries’ debts. It’s a complete change in the world economy and we can stop worrying about the climate.
    
    I nearly dropped my mug and I grabbed at it and my elbow caught the vase and it flew up in the air and I reached for it with my right hand but knocked it sideways and I went down low and knocked it up with my left hand and it went up in the air again and on its way down my mother caught it.
    
    She said That was lucky because it’s really fragile. I love that vase.
    
     
    
    By the time I got home it was getting dark. I missed my girlfriend. She was the one I wanted to talk to about all the things that were happening. I picked up the phone and she walked in the door.
    
    She said I’m sorry.
    
    I said No I’m sorry.
    
    She said I just get upset and say stuff.
    
    I said I do like your paintings really.
    
    She said I know they’re not good, I just like doing them.
    
    I said I like looking at them.
    
    She said And obviously I love making love with you.
    
    I said I don’t want to die after all and who cares about the lids of jars?
    
    Why don’t we just get married and have kids? she said.
    
    I said Yes. I said I was thinking that too.
    
    Later on I said But what about –?
    
    We’ll work it out she said.
    
    I said ok.
    
    So it turned out to be quite a good day."

    "text": "Alexis spotted their dad across the train station car park and texted their mum. She was allowed a phone once a month, just for these visits.

    ‘Ready?’ Alexis said. She took Ben’s hand and they ran, hunched over in the rain, dodging puddles to the car.
    
    ‘I want the blue side!’ Ben said. Like always, he insisted on sitting by the mismatched door.
    
    Rain pummelled the roof.
    
    ‘You look like drowned rats,’ their dad said.
    
    ‘Do we have to stay in a motel tonight?’ Ben asked.
    
    ‘Yeah, bit wet for camping.’
    
    They waited to turn out of the car park, their dad tapping his fingers on the steering wheel in time with the indicator tick.
    
    ‘So, what’s new?’
    
    ‘Not much,’ said Alexis. She had been invited to Juliet’s birthday party, a girl at the centre of a friendship group Alexis had been on the periphery of all year. She had begged her mum to let her go to the party instead, but her mum hadn’t wavered. It was their dad’s weekend. That was the rule. There’ll be other invites, she had said, not understanding that turning down an invitation left Alexis in a worse position than not being invited at all.
    
    ‘I lost another tooth,’ Ben said, baring his teeth and squishing his tongue in the canine gap.
    
    ‘Awesome, awesome,’ their dad said, but he wasn’t really listening. He turned the radio on, then off, then on again. He was always nervous at the start.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Their dad had been living with Mick, his old school friend, for two years. For the first year, Alexis and Ben visited their dad there, sleeping in a spare room with creaky beds. Mick had inherited the house from his grandparents and hadn’t changed the furniture. He went to church on Sundays, and seemed like an old person even though he was the same age as their dad. Once Alexis overheard Mick on the phone talking about their dad, saying he was while he battled some demons and found his feet, and she had imagined him in a cartoonish tumble of monsters and lightsabers.
    
    The last time they slept there, Alexis had been in the shower when Mick had come in and stared at her in the mirror while he brushed his teeth. The shower door was glass, and if she tried to cover herself it would have been like accusing him, so she stood still with the water running over her, aware of the scribble of new dark hairs between her legs. When Mick had finished brushing, he wiped his mouth with a wet hand and held a finger to his lips, shh. As soon as he left she had turned off the water and grabbed her towel. Outside the bathroom were raised voices.
    
    ‘You alright, Lexi?’ her dad had called through the door.
    
    ‘Yep!’ she had yelled back, pulling on her clothes in a rush.
    
    The rest of that day her dad had kept asking her if she was okay, and she kept saying she was fine. Later, he said, ‘This morning in the bathroom, Mick just wasn’t thinking. It won’t happen again. No need to say anything to your mum, eh?’
    
    Alexis didn’t need convincing. She hoped no one ever mentioned it again.
    
    They didn’t stay at Mick’s after that. In bad weather they went to a motel. In good weather they went camping, meaning they slept in the station wagon with the seats down flat, in a car park at a forest or beach. Their dad had a little gas stove for instant noodles, and at the supermarket he let them get whatever else they wanted – sweets and chips and sugary drinks, saying that he bet their mum never let them eat that stuff.
    
    It was true, she didn’t, but Alexis shrugged and said sometimes.
    
    On the camping weekends, even Ben knew better than to tell their mum exactly where they had slept and what they had eaten. On the train home Alexis brushed their hair and made Ben copy her, rubbing toothpaste on his teeth. For Ben the camping was all still fun, with the boundless choice in the supermarket, not washing, peeing against a tree and sleeping in his clothes. Alexis increasingly dreaded the awkwardness of having nowhere private to get changed, how the car filled up with the smell of their breath, the corrosive feeling in her mouth after all the sugar and salt.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    ‘You two are like peas in a pod,’ the motel receptionist said, nodding at Ben and their dad as she handed over the key. It was true – the crooked smile, the curls, but also the way their clothes seemed too big. Their dad was tall, but skinny in a way that looked like he wasn’t done growing. Once Ben asked their mum what a teenager was. She explained it was someone not quite a child anymore but not yet a proper adult.
    
    ‘Like Dad?’ Ben had said. Alexis had laughed at his mistake, but their mum had looked tired.
    
    ‘No, Ben, your father is an adult.’
    
    Alexis knew not to talk about Dad with her anymore, but Ben came back from their visits recounting things he had said, not noticing the uncomfortable, careful way she responded.
    
    ‘Dad said he’s gonna be his own boss soon.’
    
    ‘Well. Good for him.’
    
    ‘He’s gonna organise other people to paint houses so he doesn’t have to anymore.’
    
    ‘I hope that works out.’
    
    ‘Then will you get back together? He says you left cos he didn’t have a good job.’
    
    ‘No, Benny, this is the way things are now.’
    
    Alexis never wanted them back together. She was old enough to remember how it had been.
    
    The rainy day crawled along in the cramped motel room. They borrowed Monopoly from the reception, and Ben insisted on being the banker, even though he was slow and got the notes muddled. Their dad started going on about capitalism after landing on Park Lane, which Alexis owned. The game was abandoned to an argument.
    
    Alexis wondered what everyone was doing at Juliet’s. The unfairness of not being there stung.
    
    In the evening their dad got fish and chips. It was meant to be a treat, but Alexis didn’t feel like eating. Ben picked at the chips, his bottom lip protruding, still holding a grudge from Monopoly.
    
    ‘Eat up, you two,’ their dad said.
    
    ‘I’m not really hungry,’ Alexis said.
    
    ‘I only like chips with tomato sauce,’ said Ben. ‘And this sauce tastes funny.’
    
    ‘It’s just different to the one we have at home,’ Alexis said.
    
    ‘This is your home,’ their dad said.
    
    ‘This isn’t our home. It’s a motel,’ said Ben, perking up at the opportunity to correct an adult.
    
    ‘Wrong.’ Their dad grabbed some chips, stubbed them in the tub of sauce. ‘You’re here with me. So, you’re home.’
    
    ‘But we don’t have any of our stuff here.’
    
    ‘Stuff isn’t important. Doesn’t mean anything.’
    
    ‘What about school? We don’t go to school here,’ Ben said.
    
    ‘None of that matters.’ Their dad slammed his hand down. ‘You’re here with me.’
    
    No one said much after that. They watched a movie on the old TV about two bungling police officers. Their dad said it was a classic.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Alexis woke to pain in her stomach. The room was dark and still, and she could tell that their dad was out. The pain came and went, a dull stabbing. After a while, headlights glared through the thin curtain, swooped across the wall. Alexis pretended to sleep as he came in with shopping bags and his big backpack. She lay, not moving, and watched him pack it all, then slump, hunched and shaking. Crying, Alexis realised with a mixture of thrill and fear. He was crying.
    
    He kicked off his shoes and got into bed. The feeling in Alexis’s stomach subsided. She tried to stay awake to listen, but if he was crying it melded with the rattling hum of the mini fridge, the rain on the roof, the wind.
    
    In the morning, sun slanted in. Their dad was up and dressed, hair wet from a shower, and it was like Alexis had imagined the scene from the night before. They checked out and drove to the beach for a breakfast of chocolate biscuits in the dunes. It was too cold for swimming, but Ben and their dad dug a huge hole and channel to the sea, yelling encouragement at the waves to reach the hole. Alexis drew pictures in the sand with driftwood and signed her name with great swooping letters. She checked her phone, but there was nothing to see. When her mum had first given her the phone, it had felt, momentarily, like a gate opening to a new world. But her mum made it clear it was only for emergencies, and only for these visits. She had blocked it from downloading apps, and her mum was the only one with the number. Alexis’s argument that other people her age had their own phones hadn’t swayed her at all.
    
    Alexis had been given the phone after the visit in March when their dad hadn’t turned up at the station. Trains had rumbled past and Ben had whined about being hungry and bored. Alexis had been hungry and bored too, but there was no one for her to whine to and nothing to do except sit and wait.
    
    The man from the ticketing window had come over.
    
    ‘You two look like lost luggage,’ he had said, and lent Alexis his phone. She had tried their dad twice, but he didn’t pick up. So she had to call their mum, and because there wasn’t a train for two hours, she had driven an hour to collect them. She had just pulled up and they were about to get in her car when their dad arrived. He stopped so his car blocked hers from leaving and got out. Their mum wound down her window.
    
    ‘No way!’ he said. ‘This is my night.’
    
    ‘Nope. You weren’t here, so they’re coming home with me.’
    
    ‘A mate was helping fix my car, it took longer than we thought.’ His grey car had a blue door where the dented one had been.
    
    ‘So what? They’re kids! You don’t just leave them waiting for hours.’
    
    ‘Chill out, they were fine.’
    
    ‘They were scared.’
    
    Neither was right.
    
    ‘One night, Justine. One night a month.’ Their dad had turned to Alexis and Ben who were still standing by their mum’s car. ‘You guys wanna come with me, right?’
    
    ‘You don’t have to,’ their mum said. ‘You can come home.’
    
    Alexis had wished there was a third option, something that would beam her up and away from the car park, and this contest between her parents that went on and on, with barbed little victories but never a resolution. Ben tugged at her hand and she let him decide.
    
    ‘New door!’ he said.
    
    ‘That’s right,’ their dad had said, opening it like a chauffeur, standing wide, waving them in. Alexis had hated his look of triumph.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    The wind whipped up the sand on the beach, so they walked over the dunes to the playground with the skulking seagulls. Alexis sat on a swing and scuffed her feet. Their dad stood, watching Ben climb up the slide, and Alexis thought he might cry again.
    
    ‘Can I have a push to get started?’ she called out, although she hadn’t needed that for years.
    
    He came over and pulled the swing back, making a beeping sound like a reversing truck. As he let go, Alexis dropped her head back and the sky lurched. She moved her legs in and out, swinging until the chains juddered at the top of the arc as if they were trying to buck her off.
    
    On the way to the station Ben complained that they hadn’t had lunch.
    
    ‘I can’t send you back hungry,’ their dad said, and stopped at the mall. Alexis’s stomach felt heavy. She didn’t want food, she wanted to be home. This meant they would have to wait until the 3 o’clock train. In the bakery their dad filled a bag with cakes and pastries. It was too much, far more than they could eat. Her stomach twisted. That stabbing feeling again.
    
    ‘I need to go to the toilet,’ she said.
    
    ‘Okay, see you back at the car.’
    
    Alexis walked through the mall. Her parents had met here, working at shops that didn’t exist anymore, her mum an apprentice in the hair salon, her dad at the butcher’s, both just out of school, only six years older than Alexis. All her mother ever said about that time was that they were way too young. In the bathroom, the air thick with pine air freshener not quite masking the other smells, Alexis twisted the lock closed and sat down.
    
    There was a reddish smudge in her underpants. She wiped herself and there were more streaks of red on the paper. It was her first time. She knew what it was – from her mum and from a session at school where boys had been ushered out of the classroom and girls were shown diagrams about how to use tampons and pads. Not many people in her class had their period yet, or had admitted to having it. They had all been told it was natural and normal and nothing to be ashamed of. But boys playing lunchtime cricket at school had found a tampon once, and took turns throwing the little white bullet at each other, full of derision and disgust. Accusations had circled about whose pocket it had dropped from. Alexis had been mentioned, and like everyone else she had denied it – no way, as if – but she felt tainted all the same.
    
    She folded toilet paper into a wad and put it in her underpants, hoping it would last the couple of hours until she was home.
    
    Leaving the bathroom, she was sure people were staring. Could everybody see? A group of teenagers erupted into laughter as she passed and her face burned, thinking the blood must be showing. But she glanced sideways and they were in a huddle, fixated on one of their phones.
    
    Ben and her dad were waiting in the car.
    
    ‘You were ages,’ Ben said with a mouth full of cake.
    
    Their dad said they had time to kill and drove in the opposite direction to the train station. The town wasn’t big. Within a few streets, houses were sparse, then they were driving past farmland, cows and sheep and mathematical rows of something green. Their dad had started doing that thing, where he talked on and on, looking at them in the rear-view mirror.
    
    ‘The thing is, the system gears us to be dissatisfied with what we have. It’s like sugar. They load it into everything – bread, mayonnaise, you name it. So basically, we’re all addicted. We crave it, but we need more and more of it to actually taste sweetness. Go back and measures of status were different. Cars? Didn’t exist. En suites? There wasn’t indoor plumbing! A few hundred years ago if you got to my age with your own teeth in your head you were winning.’
    
    Ben didn’t even pretend to listen. He dabbed his finger against his tongue and made a pattern on the car window with his spit. Alexis just wanted him to keep his eyes on the road as it got steeper and winding. She guessed he was taking them to a forest park where they had camped a couple of times. Alexis didn’t like staying there. Even on nice days it felt gloomy, closed in by trees and mountains, and it was popular with hunters, who frightened Alexis with their guns strapped to their backs and their bristling, impatient dogs. Now her dad was talking about food productivity. The toilet paper between her legs was bunched up and uncomfortable. They drove past the entrance to the car park where they had stayed, and then turned off down a narrow, unsealed road, with bush pressing in each side. They needed to turn around now if they had any hope of making the 3 o’clock train.
    
    ‘Dad? Shouldn’t we be heading back?’ she said.
    
    ‘There’s no reason for anyone to be going hungry.’
    
    ‘Dad?’
    
    ‘There are 400 golf courses in New Zealand alone. 400!’ A few minutes later he came to a stop, motor still running. ‘Out we get.’
    
    Alexis and Ben stood at the side of the road. He opened the boot and unpacked their bags.
    
    ‘What about the train?’ Alexis said, but he was back in the car, wheels spinning on stones, and then he was gone. The sound of the car faded and the silence left behind was too big.
    
    ‘Is he coming back?’ Ben whispered.
    
    Alexis had no idea.
    
    ‘Yeah, of course,’ she said, like he was dumb for asking.
    
    ‘What if he doesn’t? I’m hungry.’
    
    ‘Eat, then.’ Alexis nudged the bag from the bakery that was at their feet. ‘God, don’t be such a baby,’ she said, trying to keep her own worry in check, sick of having to be the one to reassure.
    
    She got the phone out of her backpack. There was no reception. Ben sat down, eating a donut quickly and unhappily. The sun dipped behind the trees and the drop in temperature was immediate.
    
    ‘Jacket on,’ she said, making her voice soft. Ben hated his jacket because it was yellow and used to be Alexis’s and still had her name written inside. But when she held it out he put it on without complaining. She wiped cream from the corner of his mouth and handed him a chocolate milk. She was going to take one too, but worried that drinking would make more blood come.
    
    ‘Dad’ll be back real soon, Benny. Any minute.’ As if on cue he jogged into view.
    
    ‘Man, you should see your worried faces!’ he laughed, and stood hands on hips, catching his breath. ‘Good news! It’s camping time. I spoke to your mum earlier and she agreed you can stay another night.’
    
    ‘Where’s the car?’ Alexis asked.
    
    ‘I had to find a spot for it. There’s no room to park here.’
    
    ‘Where are we going to sleep?’
    
    He gestured to the forest behind her. ‘In there.’ She hadn’t noticed the start of a track.
    
    ‘We’re going to do proper camping. I’ve got a new tent.’ He hoisted on his backpack, so bulky that he almost lost his balance. ‘Ready for an adventure?’
    
    He started walking. Ben put on his own bag and scrambled after him and all Alexis could do was follow. The track was overgrown, or maybe it had never been well-formed. Orange tags nailed onto trees marked the route. Leaves held on to yesterday’s rain and dampened her clothes as she passed. Mud sucked at her sneakers. Had their mum really said they could stay? They had missed a visit two months ago when she and Ben were sick. It was possible she’d agreed to make up for that. But with school the next day? And there was the other problem. Alexis slowed down, slipped her hand down the front of her jeans and touched her underpants. Her fingers came back red. She called out that she needed to go to the toilet.
    
    ‘We’ll wait,’ her dad called back.
    
    She found a spot hidden by bushes and pulled down her jeans. The toilet paper was sodden and shocking red. She scuffed a hole in the earth with her heel and dropped the wad in and covered it. Blood was showing through on the outside of her jeans. She opened her bag trying to find something to use, but they never brought much with them. It was only meant to be one night.
    
    ‘You okay, Lexi?’ her dad called out, and she could see him through the trees, coming towards her. She grabbed a sock and stuffed it in her underpants.
    
    ‘Coming,’ she called back, pulling up her jeans. She took off her jacket and tied it around her waist.
    
    She thought about telling him. Maybe he would say they could go back. But did men even know about it? What if he didn’t understand, or he didn’t believe her? What if he wanted to see?
    
    ‘Here, have some water. This walking is thirsty work.’
    
    He handed her a bottle. She took it and pretended to drink.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    They perched on a log, eating instant noodles. Alexis was relieved it was nearly dark. She couldn’t see the state of her jeans, which meant neither could Ben or her dad. Alexis only ate the noodles, tilting her bowl and pouring out the liquid when they weren’t looking. Their dad packed away the gas cooker and said it was time to go.
    
    ‘We’re not staying here?’ she said.
    
    ‘We’d roll down the hill in our sleep. We’ll be on flat ground soon.’
    
    ‘But it’s dark,’ Ben said.
    
    ‘Good thing I thought ahead.’ He rummaged in a pocket of his backpack then dangled a headlamp in front of each of them. ‘Told you this would be an adventure.’
    
    He helped adjust the elastic, showed them where the on button was, and they set off again. Three bright eyes in the night.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Alexis stared at the blank blue of the tent wall. She had almost believed their mum had agreed to an extra night. But in the lamplight last night, when her dad was getting the tent out of his pack, she’d seen a big bag of rice, packets of noodles, extra gas canisters, enough for days and days – far more days than their mum would ever agree to. She could see now it was all deliberate, walking on this track that didn’t even have a sign, the car parked who knows where. He didn’t want them to be found. But the longer it went on the more trouble he would be in – and not just from their mum.
    
    She rolled over carefully. Ben was a scruff of hair at the top of the sleeping bag next to her, and her dad was a featureless mound on the other side. She gathered her things, and eased up the tent zip, glad that sleeping through anything was another way her dad and brother were the same.
    
    Outside it was light, but not fully, like the colour of the world was still getting turned up. Everything was covered by a soft fuzz of moss, and beech trees stretched up towards the brightening sky. Walking at night, it had seemed the trees were props that sprung up when she shone her light on them and collapsed again when they were in the dark. Now she could see the trees went on forever.
    
    Alexis moved away from the tent and squatted down, but no wee came out. The sock had moved out of place in her sleep and her underpants and jeans were a mess. She smelled bad down there. Not drinking was working though, she noted with relief. The blood was coming out thicker and darker, like it was drying up. It was worth feeling thirsty.
    
    She needed to start walking.
    
    The day before they had walked for five hours, maybe six. Her phone had run out of battery and her had dad said the time didn’t matter. If she left now she could maybe contact her mum by lunchtime, they could be home in the afternoon, and sleep in their own beds that night. Maybe it could all be explained as a misunderstanding.
    
    There was the matter of her jeans. She needed to find a river or a stream to wash herself. They hadn’t crossed any on the track walking in, but she thought she had heard water a few times. Then, when she was clean, she would find the road and walk until she saw people and could ask to call her mum. A river then the road, she repeated in her head. She found an orange track marker nailed to a tree and started to walk.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Water. She was sure of it. She turned sideways to edge down the slope, using trees as handrails to steady herself. But where it seemed there should be water, there was only the sound of it, and more forest, more slope. She kept going down until she reached the bottom of a gully. There might have been a river there once but she had heard only the ghost of it, or a trick of the wind, because there was no water there now. She had wasted what, an hour? She started climbing. It was slower, and harder, pulling herself up. When she thought she had climbed enough, she looked for a marker on a tree but there were none. The forest made false paths, with tree roots suggesting stairs, ferns seeming to line a trail, before ending in a rock or a drop or a dense tangle of bush.
    
    Her tongue felt like carpet, throat like sand. She would give anything for a drink. It had been dumb not to take any food from the tent. She sat down and looked through her bag, just in case. Toothpaste? She squeezed the tube into her mouth, thinking it might at least get rid of the rough feeling, but the gob of gel was thick and gummy. She didn’t have enough saliva to spit it out so had to wipe her tongue on her sleeve.
    
    The sun was beyond its high point so it must be afternoon. It had been in front of them yesterday, and so if she kept it behind her, surely she would reach a road eventually. She made herself stand, made herself keep going.
    
    The sun tracked its way across the sky. Had anyone walked here, ever?
    
    The trees thinned and she hoped, briefly, that she was coming to the edge of the forest. She imagined emerging into a backyard with white sheets flapping on a washing line. But no. She stood on a rocky ledge, and the ground dropped away and a valley spread out before her. There were mountains waiting behind the mountains. The low sun caught on the seam of water far below, turning the surface gold. She had found her river, but it was impossible to reach.
    
    Wind blew and she could see its progress, a huge invisible hand skimming across the trees like velvet pushed the wrong way.
    
    It would be cold soon. Everything ached. Pain knuckled her head. Her tongue was too big for her mouth. Her body was a too-heavy thing she was sick of hauling around. Time to rest.
    
    Back in the forest, Alexis found a hollow in the earth beside a fallen beech tree. It would fit her fine. She lay on her side, the way she always fell asleep. She pulled her green jacket around her. The ferns formed an awning and the tree was reassuring against her back. Nothing here minded the blood. The smell of her was just another smell alongside sap and damp earth and rotting wood. She was lost luggage. Her mum would come and get her, or her dad would find her. Next to her face, her hand was resting on fallen beech leaves, each the size of a fingernail and coloured dark green, or red, or brown the same shade as her hair. Alexis shut her eyes.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    The white dog moves through the night forest, a whorl of muscle and intention. Time is running out. His people are tired. He absorbs the scents from the earth, the scents in the air, his whole being filtering them.
    
    Then – there – a scent, pulling him along a ridge, over rocks, moss, through the bush. There is nothing elective to this movement. The scent splits, intensifies, and he slows, nose to the ground. He is close. Tree, tree, tree, ferns, girl.
    
    She is oil and salt and a streak of chemical mint and blood. Most of all she is blood. Wounded? He nudges at her. Not wound blood, but her own, old, and new.
    
    The girl jerks and opens her eyes. Fear rises off her like steam. He inhales it, and the hairs on his neck stiffen automatically, his mouth ready to snarl. But she doesn’t move, just lies, body tense, breath like she has been running. Then, because he has been so long, two faint whistle blasts. He tilts his head towards the sound, then back to consider her. He whines. He could bark. He could draw his people here.
    
    No. She is not the animal they need.
    
    And he is off, running again through the scents, trying to find a good one, before the night is done."

    "text": "When Jean was nearly seventeen years old, she instigated an affair with a house painter in his early forties who played drums in a Beatles cover band. Her boyfriend had asked her to go with him to the all-ages early show at a bar that was usually only for people who were over twenty-one. They quickly saw that even at the early show the crowd was still mostly people their parents’ age, though neither set of parents would come to a place like this. Jean could think of a few of their teachers who might, but none of them were there either. Maybe they were waiting for the late show? Jean had driven so that her boyfriend could eat some psychedelic mushroom caps he’d foraged a few days earlier and dried at home with a lamp whose intended function was to regulate his little brother’s iguana’s body heat.

    ‘You’ll be okay?’ she asked as he unbuckled his seat belt with a demeanor indicating that whatever had happened to him was still happening to him. They were parked in his driveway and she could see the play of TV light on the drawn curtains in the living room.
    
    ‘The world is just the truth,’ he said. ‘There isn’t anything extra.’ Jean did not agree, but he hadn’t phrased it as a question. He leaned in to kiss her and she turned her face slightly to the side. If she allowed him a full kiss he might say something else ridiculous, perhaps about the fundamental strangeness of a ritual that involved touching tongues.
    
    Instead of going home she drove back to the bar. In the parking lot, under the glow of the dome light with her face framed in the mirror of the flipped-down sunshade, she applied a layer of makeup that made her look like someone older who was trying to look younger. Her boyfriend kept a spare pack of cigarettes in her glove box and she took one, though she did not smoke. She walked up to the bar holding it and said hello to the bouncer, who gave a nod and waved her in.
    
    The late show drink special was two-for-one daiquiris because it was Wednesday. This was Florida, in the late 1990s, in a strip mall on Griffin Road, thirty or forty minutes to the north and west of what you’d probably think of if someone said ‘Miami’. Until relatively recently, this had been part of the Everglades, the famous River of Grass, a unique, irreplaceable wonder of the Earth that was being methodically drained for developments such as the one where Jean lived, the one where her boyfriend lived, the high school they attended, and this strip mall.
    
    Jean had not planned further than achieving re-entry to the bar. She probably would have turned around and left but just then the performance began. It felt natural to drift toward the front of the room, to a cocktail table shared by a couple, where there was an empty third chair. She asked if they minded if she sat. They said no, not at all, please join them. The man introduced himself as Grayson and the woman as Cori, short for Corinth, not Corinne like most people would assume. They explained this in husky whispers while the band warmed up the crowd with ‘I’ve Got a Feeling’. Grayson wore a green Lacoste shirt tucked into his jeans; Cori wore white stretch pants and a floral peasant top that was as long as a short dress. They both wore Birkenstocks and expensive rings and it was clear they were reliving their own youth or some version of it that they’d seen on television and over the years had come to believe had been their own. They hadn’t quite dressed the part for whatever they thought they were doing, but they were having a good time and Jean recognized that she herself was playing dress-up, so what was it to her. Grayson got up to get a drink and Cori told Jean she had a good aura. The band played ‘Ticket to Ride’, then ‘Nowhere Man’, both of which Jean had heard at the early show. Next they played ‘Taxman’ and everyone started cheering because it was April. The drummer sang lead and he had an excited sneer in his voice when he sang lines like ‘Be thankful I don’t take it all.’ This was Leon. The audience whooped and booed, thinking of cruel and beloved Uncle Sam, who gave them their freedoms but also said pay up or else.
    
    Grayson returned to the table with a pint of beer in one hand and two strawberry daiquiris teetering in the other. ‘They were two for one,’ he said. ‘So I figured.’ Jean thanked Grayson and accepted the drink. It was sickly sweet but also tart, like a Pixy Stick. She liked that the crushed ice chilled her while the cheap rum warmed her. She liked that she already felt like a regular at this bar though she didn’t particularly like this bar. She had a good view of the drummer from where she was sitting and she liked his voice and the fact that he was a singing drummer. She decided to introduce herself to him after the show.
    
    When the show ended, she thanked Grayson again for the drink and said goodnight to him and to Cori, who leaned in and kissed her on the cheek. The couple left and Jean walked toward the stage, where the band was packing up their equipment, unplugging various cords and wrapping them tightly, using their forearms or fists as spools.
    
    Leon had curly hair that was not yet entirely gray. He had worn it in a stumpy ponytail while he played but now it hung freely about his ears. Jean had straight black hair that spilled nearly to her waist. She was tall and sturdy in bootcut jeans and a loose white shirt of her father’s, untucked, with the sleeves rolled up and the top buttons undone so you could see the gray ribbed tank top underneath. People often took her for Native American, which she half was – her mother was a registered member of the Cowlitz nation – but she always denied this when asked. She had no shame about her heritage. She only hid it because of how weird people could get about it. This was a few years after Disney’s Pocahantas and she had been asked more times than she cared to remember whether she could paint with all the colors of the wind. In the seventh grade her math teacher had told the whole class that the land on which the school sat was rightfully Jean’s. She’d raised her hand and explained that the Cowlitz were Native to the opposite side of the country and that this was, if anything, Tequesta and Seminole land, though the history of the Seminole tribe as a tribe was complicated, being largely an epiphenomenon (she didn’t use this word) of resistance to colonization and chattel slavery, and anyway the land wasn’t really anyone’s, it was the Everglades. Or it had used to be. Her parents had met at Stanford and were no more native to South Florida than whites, Cubans, or anyone else. The teacher had been afraid to interrupt her while she spoke, but when the bell rang he held her back and handed her a detention slip for being disruptive. After that, she answered all queries about her heritage by saying that her father was an emotionally abusive Jewish real estate lawyer. Nobody had any more questions after that, and the statement had the further virtue of being true.
    
    Decades later, a therapist in Chicago would ask her whether she thought there was a causal link between her complicated feelings about her father, who had recently died after a long battle with stomach cancer, and her affair with the middle-aged drummer when she was sixteen. ‘Nearly seventeen,’ Jean would correct him, and she would say she did not see any link and would mean it, but she would not be believed. She’d only mentioned Leon at all because it had occurred to her while talking about her father that the two men were roughly the same age, and she wondered whether Leon was still alive. Also, that the period of the affair had tracked closely with the period of her father’s worst emotional abuse, the dark time which had preceded and ultimately resulted in his entering therapy, though by that point the affair with Leon had ended. Jean’s therapist would assure her that he understood correlation was not necessarily causation but that in this case, well – come on! He would say this to her: ‘Come on!’ She would end the therapeutic relationship on the spot. He would object in strenuous terms, and then fall to pleading, which would strike Jean not only as inappropriate but pathetic. She found displays of male weakness repulsive; they hardened her heart against whoever was blubbering in front of her. The therapist told her that the affair with Leon had left her emotionally arrested and that this was not only the reason she was still single – being incapable, as a perpetual adolescent, of adult relationships – but was also the reason why she had chosen a high school teaching career and now spent her days around teenagers. He told her she was living in a self-made cage that only he could free her from and if she did not continue her treatment, she was likely to fall into a situation with one of her own charges that would reproduce what had happened to her, but she would be the perpetrator this time. She laughed aloud when he said that, a vital disbelieving laugh that captured the absolute contempt in which she now held him. She had never once considered a sexual relationship with one of her students, not even the most attractive or emotionally mature of them, any more than she had considered a sexual relationship with one of her teachers when she was a student. She was a good and committed educator and had always believed, rightly or wrongly, that her experience with Leon had been unique, self-contained, and without lasting consequence: entirely her own. That had been the point of it from the start. And it was for that reason that she had never told the story to anyone before.
    
    She’d liked his ropy forearms and his chinos with frayed cuffs, the fact that he wore flip-flop sandals like life was a beach, and that the sandals never caught on a drum pedal or amp cord when he played. He always wore band T-shirts, onstage as well as off, but never for the band that his band pretended to be. It was all groups he’d seen, mostly in the 80s, such as Aerosmith and the Allman Brothers. But the first night she’d seen him play – and then again three weeks later when she returned to the bar to reintroduce herself and make her interest unmistakable – Leon wore a T-shirt commemorating the Steely Dan 1993 World Tour. The shirt featured the band’s name in hideous blue below a tableau of national flags arranged vortically around an electric guitar the same hideous color as the band name. The graphics were printed on white cotton that reminded her of the phys ed uniform she’d had to wear in middle school, which was where she had been the year of this tour.
    
    She sat again with Cori and Grayson, who said they’d missed her. It dawned on Jean with muted horror that these people came to this place to see this band every Wednesday of their lives. Leon was singing the lead on ‘Carry That Weight’. She told the couple that she was twenty-three years old and working as an in-home caregiver for the elderly and disabled. It was contract work and the hours were unpredictable; she hoped to save up and go back to school to finish a teaching certificate. They accepted all of this without question, which gave Jean confidence that Leon would as well. Grayson treated her to another BOGO daiquiri and she drank it as fast as she could.
    
    Leon did believe her story – why wouldn’t he? – and she stuck to it for three months. After school let out for the summer she had fewer hours of unavailability to account for and that made things easier. Her boyfriend was away being a camp counselor in Maine. She told Leon that the reason they could never go to her apartment was because she had an agoraphobic roommate who would listen to them through the wall with a cup to her ear. Leon suggested she move. He didn’t like to think of her living with someone who was both mentally ill and a pervert. Jean said this was a good idea, but you know how these things take time. Leon did know. He’d been there. And as far as the two of them were concerned, it was fine to always go to his apartment. He didn’t care.
    
    Leon was generous in all ways: as a listener, as a lover. If they split an entrée, he was careful not to eat more than his share. Boys her own age (and, later, men her own age) were always saying they were cool with splitting an entrée, especially if they were treating, but they counted on you not eating more than three bites of the steak or whatever it was. Jean liked to eat her share of food and she liked that Leon liked for her to do this. He would have showered her with gifts all the time if he’d had any money. Her birthday was approaching and she had mentioned it in the hope that he would do something special for her. Nothing expensive, just special. She reminded herself that, as far as Leon knew, she was turning twenty-four.
    
    He lived in a humid ground floor apartment in a building on a canal near a massive outlet mall that when viewed from above was revealed to have the shape of an alligator. Alligators had been common here before the Everglades was drained to build the alligator-shaped mall. When the mall had opened in 1990, Jean vaguely remembered, the local news had sent up a helicopter so everyone could see what it looked like from above. When you were inside the mall it did not feel like being inside of an alligator. There was no sense that this particular store or corridor was in the snout or tail or claw. Mostly you knew which food court you were closest to, the one with the fresh-baked pretzel kiosk or the one with the teriyaki chicken place that gave out free samples. Toothpicks in rows straight as veterans’ gravestones sticking out of chunks of glistening meat each the size of a throat lozenge. The platter was held by an employee in a red apron and matching hairnet who would not look you in the eye but wouldn’t scold you if you came back for a second sample.
    
    Jean’s family lived in a monied suburb south and slightly to the west of this mall. They lived at what was now the frontier of the Everglades, though it wouldn’t always be. Jean’s father, who’d had a hand in making their subdivision possible, sometimes stood in their back yard and looked out toward the flat horizon and told Jean or her mother or the maid, whoever was around, that someday soon there’d be a Starbucks and a Shell station out there. He was right.
    
    In the fifth and sixth grades, Jean would go to the outlet mall with her girlfriends to cruise the long body of the alligator. They’d dip fingers into fountains and flick the water. They’d laugh at lingerie in display windows and take second samples of chicken. One time Jean went back for thirds. She’d met no resistance from the employee and returned to the girls in triumph, with the morsel in her mouth and the toothpick poking from between her grinning lips, but something had shifted in the mere moments that she’d been away. She’d looked at her girlfriends uncomprehendingly, searching each stony face for a clue. The sweet gooey chicken, still unswallowed, was cooling on her tongue.
    
    ‘You can be such a piggy sometimes,’ Charlene Stevens said, and then all five girls turned on their heels like it was something they’d practiced, which for all Jean knew, they had.
    
    Now she went to the outlet mall with Leon. Not only was it cheap but she was sure she’d never see anyone she knew there. All the kids from her school went to the fancy mall on the other side of town. Nobody wanted anything from an outlet store. Leon and Jean were free to hold hands while they strolled. She tried on some of the lingerie that she and her friends used to gawk and howl about. She thought lingerie was silly but it wasn’t as though she didn’t understand the principles involved. She’d taken AP Psych! Her parents paid for HBO! She was coming to understand that sex was a secret you shared with another person, but sexiness was sort of a joke that you were in on with yourself. She stood in the changing room before the full-length mirror, admiring herself in a matching bra and panty set the color of fresh blood, as bright as if it were oozing from a newly scraped knee. She closed her eyes to make sure she really liked the fit, and not merely the look, of the garments. Leon stood on the other side of the curtain, being chivalrous and very excited because, this being the outlet mall, and the garments in question on clearance besides, he would be able to afford the set and so insisted on purchasing it for her as a gift for what he believed was her twenty-fourth birthday. She handed the garments to him around the side of the curtain and he went to pay and have them wrapped while she put her regular clothes back on.
    
    Jean asked if he’d like to split a plate of teriyaki chicken over rice. He said he would be happy to share with her. They walked to the food court and over to the restaurant stall and stopped at the free sample station as though considering their options, though the decision had already been made. The employee holding the platter today was a short plump woman with gold clasps high on her earlobe cartilage. She was wearing latex gloves that were translucent enough to reveal a dreamcatcher tattoo down the side of the index finger of the hand with which she proffered napkins in case anyone wanted to wipe their mouths. The dreamcatcher design included an eagle feather that dangled down to her fingertip.
    
    ‘Norma!’ Leon said when he saw the tattoo. He’d not yet looked at the woman’s face nor she at his, but he’d have known that tattoo anywhere. He’d been there when she’d gotten it, had in fact supplied the Vicodin that had made the procedure bearable. Some people found transcendent calm or even ecstasy in submitting to the tattooist’s needle, but not Norma. She and Leon had been living together at the time. Norma looked from Leon’s face to Jean’s face and then to the paper bag Jean held, the name of the store emblazoned on its wide side.
    
    ‘Oh boy,’ Norma said. ‘Don’t look now.’ But she already had.
    
    Leon and Norma caught up for a couple of minutes, not getting overly sentimental or specific in their reminiscences, except about a mutual friend named Arnold Anderson who had died a few years earlier. They both knew he’d overdosed but avoided saying so. They only said what a shame it was. Jean was not jealous. It made sense to her that people would have histories. When she had a history of her own, this would be part of it. She was over by the counter waiting for the food, which she’d already ordered and paid for. ‘It looks like you’ve got your life all figured out,’ she heard Leon say to Norma.
    
    Norma replied, ‘Well, I’m hanging in there.’
    
    ‘Yeah, that’s it,’ Leon said, with a forced cheer intended to direct the conversation to its end. ‘Hanging in and not hanging out.’
    
    They took their food to a table far from the chicken stall. With their sporks they scooped and poked into the hot wet heap of meat and rice.
    
    ‘Sorry about that,’ Leon said. ‘I hope it didn’t put a dampener on this wonderful day we were having.’ Jean assured him that it did not. To prove it, she asked a few questions about Norma and those bygone times. Leon answered dutifully, even when the answers cast him in a less than flattering light, as far as the overall way he’d been living back then and what had led to the break up. But all that was a long time ago, even before the 1993 Steely Dan world tour, the commemorative shirt from which Leon happened to be wearing yet again.
    
    Jean appreciated that Leon was so emphatic in his performance of candor, on top of the fact that he actually seemed to be being candid. Beneath his honesty about the squalid chaos of the Norma days, Jean sensed, there was genuine affection for Norma herself that wasn’t yet abated and that he hoped not to trouble her with. She thought this a sign of sophistication and respect and wanted to demonstrate a maturity commensurate with his own. So after they’d returned to his apartment, and she’d duly donned, modeled, and been relieved of the birthday lingerie, and they were lying sweaty flank to flank in the narrow bed the apartment had come furnished with, she told him that there was something about her upcoming birthday that she needed him to know. He laughed and turned her face toward his by touching his pointer finger to her chin and gently pushing her head. He said women always lied about their ages. He had figured this was coming and it was okay if she was really twenty-eight or even thirty. Women thought thirty was a big deal, Leon said, when really it was nothing. You could easily view it as still being the start of your life.
    
    ‘Oh boy,’ Jean said, quoting Norma from earlier without realizing it. She no longer wanted to tell him the truth but there was no obvious way out of the conversation and she was too proud or honest to take the lifeline he did not know he had thrown her.
    
    All the color drained from Leon’s face. He jumped out of the narrow bed, accidentally pulling the top sheet with him so Jean was fully revealed. She sat up. A scream stalled in Leon’s throat as he threw the sheet over her. She looked like a child pretending to be a ghost. He grabbed his pants from where they lay on the scratchy brown carpet that always felt a little damp even when it definitely wasn’t. He ran with pants in-hand to the bathroom and locked the door. She could hear him crying on the far side of it while she dressed.
    
    ‘I could be in prison!’ he yelled. ‘I might never see my kids!’
    
    Jean apologized a few times but she was getting impatient. She was annoyed by his refusal to come out of the bathroom. She had not meant to precipitate a breakup but since it was happening she felt that they ought to do it face to face. This in the name of that same maturity that had provoked the honesty that had ruined everything. But that didn’t matter anymore, and neither did mutual respect, apparently. Leon would not see her. He would not discuss things. He had stopped responding to her entirely. She was already in the rearview mirror of his life, one more thing that had seemed so promising as he’d approached it, but was now bitterly relieved to see receding behind him to a speck and then to nothing at all. If she hadn’t still been able to hear his hitched breath and quiet crying she might have guessed he’d climbed out the bathroom window, like in that one Beatles song he sang, but in reverse. She was one more thing he would count himself lucky to have survived.
    
    Jean didn’t see Leon again for nearly a year. Then she happened to see him twice in the same week. On a Sunday she had gone with her age-appropriate boyfriend (a different one) to a free all-day local music festival in a city park. She had noticed that Leon’s band was on the bill and so had known that they might run into each other because it wasn’t like the musicians were tucked away in some fancy backstage area. It was the kind of scene where everyone mingled and hung around. A sign said that the purpose of the festival was to raise money to save the Everglades. The music was free and the idea was that the money you would have spent on a ticket to the concert would be given as a donation to the organization that had sponsored the festival. The organization’s goal was to raise awareness. Their private expectation was to recoup in donations slightly less than half of what it had cost to stage the festival.
    
    Jean’s current boyfriend was unlike the last one in almost every way, but the boyfriends did have one thing in common, which was a desire to take drugs to establish a deeper relationship with music they already knew. Jean had driven to the festival so that her boyfriend was free to get as high as he wanted to get. He’d figured he’d be able to find some psychedelics once they got there, but he failed. He went back to the parking lot. In the car he had stashed three Xanax that he had taken from a bottle his mother had been prescribed after a minor car accident. He chased these with glugs from a plastic water bottle that he’d filled with vodka that morning. It had sat in the hot car for hours and he felt proud at being able to keep it down.
    
    Jean had expected this to be a long day and her expectation was being met. She had agreed to come in part because the prospect of running into Leon excited her. Not that she was hoping to run into him, just that it was exciting to know that she might. Maybe he’d apologize for his behavior, the crying and locking himself away. She felt she was owed this. She also felt she owed him an apology about creating a situation that could have possibly affected his visitation with his children. She hadn’t known about that at the time. Maybe Norma would be with him and there would be a dramatic scene.
    
    None of that happened. Her boyfriend overheated in the midday sun. She took him to the medical tent and left him there. She stood at the back of the crowd during Leon’s band’s set. She wasn’t hiding, she was simply more comfortable out of the crush by the stage. The band wasn’t doing Beatles covers that day. They played a few originals, songs Jean remembered Leon playing for her in private – demos the guys had recorded, or sometimes he’d pluck one out on his acoustic guitar and sing it for her – then they did the Allman Brothers instrumental ‘Melissa’, from which they attempted an improvised segue into ‘Blue Sky’, also an Allmans tune. The lead guitar player’s work during the segue was labored and Jean could see the frustration on Leon’s face as he drummed. Or maybe she was imagining that, because she was still at the back of the crowd, but she did remember what his face looked like when he was frustrated. Leon had complained to Jean about the lead guitar player many times. She had once suggested firing him from the band but Leon said they had grown up here together and he would never betray a friend even if the friend was a middling talent and sometimes a pain in the ass. Besides, the lead guitar player owned the band’s van.
    
    Now the lead guitar player said into the mic, ‘We’re gonna bring it down for a minute, folks,’ and then turned to Leon, who hit the kick drum and the snare at once, inaugurating the new song, on which he would sing the lead. The song began, ‘By and by, girl, we’ll get over things we’ve done and the things we’ve said.’ Jean did not recognize this song, which was from Steely Dan co-founder Walter Becker’s solo record 11 Tracks of Whack, which had come out in 1994, the year after Leon had seen the Steely Dan world tour. Jean thought that this was another original song and that Leon had written it, since he was singing it. She began to fantasize that he had written it for, or rather about, her. When he sang the chorus, in which the line ‘There’s a star in the book of liars by your name’ is repeated twice, she felt gooseflesh ripple down her bare arms despite the heat of the afternoon. She was absolutely certain that this was her song.
    
    The set ended and the band was still packing up but Leon seemed to have left by the time Jean got to the stage area. Someone else was packing up his drum kit. She wanted to ask about him but didn’t want to talk to any of the bandmates. She didn’t know what Leon might have said about her – not the truth, surely – to have explained her abrupt expulsion from his life. She picked up her boyfriend from the medical tent and they left the park.
    
    That was Sunday. The following Thursday, her no longer very emotionally abusive father asked her to go to the hardware store to pick up an orbital sander so he could refinish their back deck. Normally he would have hired someone to do this for him but he was currently in a form of therapy that encouraged physical activity and home improvement projects as means of developing self-control, learning to find satisfaction in small things, and channeling one’s energies into healthy interests rather than getting trapped in the cycle of repression, explosion, and remorse. Jean’s father said he was going to leave work promptly at five. If she could pick up the orbital sander on her way home from school, which got out at three, he would have a few good hours of daylight left to put into the deck. Jean, who wanted to encourage these healthy interests and development of self-control, agreed to run the errand. At the hardware store, she saw Leon. He was wearing an orange uniform smock and working in the paint section, running the machine that mixed the custom colors.
    
    She stuck the bright green box containing the orbital sander under her arm. She waited until he was without customers and then strode boldly up to him. ‘I heard your song,’ she said, trying to sound brazen, perhaps affronted, though she wasn’t.
    
    ‘What?’ he said. And then, ‘Not here.’
    
    He said he was about to go on break. She went to the front of the store and purchased the orbital sander while he clocked out. They reconvened a few minutes later in her parked car. He insisted that he had not written a song about her. She sang the chorus for him and he laughed like he had during their last happy moment together, when he had thought she was about to tell him that she was secretly thirty years old.
    
    ‘Okay,’ he said, still laughing. ‘You caught me.’
    
    ‘I guess it was pretty messed up, what I did,’ she said. He patted her thigh reassuringly. The reflexive intimacy of the gesture was a shock to both of them. He quickly withdrew his hand.
    
    ‘If anyone should be apologizing,’ he said, and took a deep breath as though preparing to make a statement rehearsed in private countless times.
    
    ‘Oh no,’ she said, cutting him off. ‘I take it as a gesture of respect.’ She meant the negative portrayal of her in the song she thought that he had written.
    
    Leon had no idea what to say to that. His break was almost over. He was back with Norma now. They were doing the one day at a time thing – hanging in, not hanging out – and even his kids’ mother said that the situation was better than in who knew how long. She was sometimes allowing sleepovers on nights that were technically hers.
    
    Leon telling Jean that he was back with Norma seemed to foreclose whatever line of conversation she’d been about to open. She herself could not have said for certain what line it would have been. Unlike Leon, she had rehearsed nothing, had not imagined a single thing about this moment beyond the fact that it might, at some point, occur. She was enamored of the mystery of her own heart, the inherent outlawry of desire itself, which she and Leon had translated into an actual if inadvertent crime, a crime with which they’d gotten away. Jean was looking forward to breaking up with her boyfriend, who had been cheating on her with Charlene Stevens, who would, in the weeks following 9/11, abruptly become an evangelical Christian and call Jean, who was away at college at Reed because she’d been offered a scholarship there and liked being close to the Cowlitz Nation, and Charlene would confess her high school sins to Jean and Jean would tell her that she’d known about it at the time and it didn’t matter, not then except as a pretext for a breakup and not now in any way, shape, or form. If Charlene were really looking for something to apologize for, Jean would say, why not that time at the alligator mall when she turned all the other girls against her over chicken on a toothpick? That moment, Jean would say, was the loneliest she had ever felt, or expected to feel, in her entire life. It had changed a lot of things for her in ways that were difficult to explain. There would be a long silence on the phone and then Charlene would say, ‘My word, Jean, grow up, there’s a war on,’ and hang up without saying God bless you or goodbye.
    
    In this moment, all that was still to come. So much was to come! Jean was looking forward to all of it. She would go home and hand the orbital sander to her father, and hear the whir and whup of it from her bedroom window, which she would have already opened to receive the cool evening air. Then there was the whole rest of life to look forward to, all that future history. Her heart was full of love for the life she would live, and when she was the age that Leon was now, and firing her therapist, she would think back to this long-ago time and recognize that she had been right. She would say to the therapist, ‘All anyone wants is to love their life and I have loved mine.’ After saying this she would slam his office door behind her, rattling the frame of an expressionist female nude whose presence in the waiting room had always irked her.
    
    In the meantime, Jean gave Leon a chaste kiss on the cheek and released him back into his workday. She pulled out of the hardware store parking lot, still humming to herself the brutal and beautiful song she still believed and would always believe that he had written. It was the most generous thing anyone had ever done for her – borne witness to her full true self – and she did not mind that there wasn’t another living soul who she could tell."

    "text": "The first mother Avni brings home is too clean. She wears white at all times, perpetually a mourner, and roams the two-bed flat with a feather duster tied to her slim wrist. ‘Don’t I look just like Aishwarya Rai?’ she asks, and pours bleach into the bathtub and onto her body. Scrub-a-dub-dub. Avni asks her no questions and takes her straight back.

    At the shelter, they lead her to the back and shoot her. ‘She’s had multiple placements,’ they explain. ‘Sometimes, this is the humane option.’
    
    The second mother is mean, and very, very beautiful. This one actually does look like Aishwarya Rai, Avni thinks. A star. She buys a weighing scale and makes Avni stand on it and watch the numbers wobble.
    
    ‘Too high!’ she decides when they steady.
    
    ‘Let’s play a game,’ Avni says, stepping off the scale. She crosses her arms over her body and watches as she shrinks in the mirror. ‘Would you rather have a fat, happy daughter, or a daughter who is thin and sad?’
    
    The second mother doesn’t hesitate: ‘Thin.’
    
    ‘And sad.’
    
    ‘Yes,’ she agrees.
    
    Avni nods. ‘How do you sleep?’
    
    ‘Too well,’ she confesses. ‘Like a baby.’
    
    The shelter people take her back, no problem. She has a highly desirable look, they say, and will find another home quickly. And does Avni want to take another look around?
    
    Avni does.
    
    The third mother is sad. All she talks about is the village she came from, where she’d had cows and babies who all died one by one. She’d longed for a living child her whole life, she says, but Avni has never been to a village, nor once felt the urge to milk cows.
    
    ‘Did you love your husband?’ she says, and when the third mother nods, asks why.
    
    ‘My choices were to love him or not,’ she says. ‘And loving him seemed easier.’
    
    ‘That’s a good answer,’ says Avni, and decides to keep her, at least for a while.
    
    They learn each other slowly. Third Mother wakes each day to make kadak chai and drink it on the two by two foot balcony with a wrought iron railing that Avni never uses except to dry her underwear. Third Mother drinks several cups of chai a day. Third Mother cooks in the late afternoons for dinner and next day’s lunch. Third Mother packs tiffins and sends them to Avni’s office with the neighbourhood dabbawala. Third Mother puts too much salt in her food, but Avni’s tastebuds adjust. Avni starts to crave salt. Avni likes having a hot lunch every day. Avni likes having a hot dinner. Avni likes that Third Mother snores because she can hear it through their shared wall. Avni has panic attacks when she tries to sleep. Avni gets cold all over and her legs twitch like the limbs of a dying insect. Avni feels frightened and lonely and frequently lightheaded. Avni needs company in the night-time but Avni doesn’t like men.
    
    ‘How old are you?’ Third Mother asks one week into living together. She’s opened the small kitchen window for ventilation while she fries bhindi in hot mustard oil. Through the metal bars, Avni can see the alley, and past it, into the balconies of the building next door. In the early mornings they are parrot perches, and in the afternoons, drying racks. In the nights, smoke spots for fathers, sons, rebel daughters.
    
    ‘Twenty-three,’ Avni replies. ‘You?’
    
    ‘Thirty-seven,’ she says. The bhindi crackles.
    
    ‘You look much older,’ says Avni, surprised. ‘It must be all the grief.’
    
    Third Mother wears salwars on weekdays and sarees on weekends and tries on short dresses from Avni’s cupboard when Avni isn’t home. She marks her parting with sindoor and has long, butt-length hair that Avni pulls from between her teeth at mealtimes and out the shower drain each week. Her eyes are deeply lined.
    
    Avni panics on a Saturday night and doesn’t know why. Her arms and legs spasm, stop being hers. She clenches her muscles for ten seconds, breathes in, breathes out. She wants to call her mother but they haven’t talked in nearly six months. She folds her knees under herself and leans forward in child’s pose. She lets her belly hang between her thighs. She tries to rest her forehead on the floor but fails. She times her breaths to Third Mother’s snores and makes it through the night.
    
    ‘How did you sleep,’ Third Mother asks the next morning, and Avni lies.
    
    ‘Fine.’
    
    Third Mother hums but doesn’t push.
    
    Avni had thought that she liked that about her. She doesn’t say anything. She says, ‘Do you need anything washed?’
    
    Third Mother brings her a basket full of clothes and cotton panties with lace trims.
    
    Avni’s bedsheets are soaked in sweat. She strips them and throws everything into the machine. She sits, watches soap bubbles form and froth and go round in circles. The day is a wash. Scrub-a-dub-dub.
    
    ‘Why did you choose me?’ Third Mother asks one day while Avni is making coffee.
    
    It has been nearly a month since Avni brought her home. The knobs for the stove stopped working years ago, so she turns the dials until she hears the click of the gas then holds a lighter to the burner until it catches flame.
    
    ‘You looked like all the mothers on TV,’ Avni says.
    
    All the mothers on TV look tired and sad and like they are singularly holding their families together.
    
    At work, Avni adds subtitles to ads for shampoo and Knorr instant soup mixes. Her desk is infested with roaches but the view is good. Sixteen floors high, the Arabian Sea a kilometre away. Aishwarya Rai tosses her gorgeous, bouncy hair over her shoulder and says, ‘Total Repair 5: Because we’re worth it.’ A little boy says, ‘Mom, do we eat or drink this?’ and his mom replies: ‘Knorr Soupy Noodles! Swallow how you like.’
    
    The noodles make Avni hungry. She sneaks away. Outside the front of the building, there’s a Starbucks and a Crêpe Suzette. To the back of the building, under big swathes of tarpaulin stitched together, a khao gully. She buys a vada pav for thirty rupees and asks for extra salt, extra chillies, extra bhajji. Her mother had never let her eat street food growing up. She breaks off small bits of the soft buttered bread and feeds them to the calico on the corner.
    
    Her job bores her. The cat accepts crumbs from her hand then sets to work with her rough tongue. Scrub-a-dub-dub. All detergent ads are the same. A child comes home from school dripping in mud. A mother says, ‘Ay-hay!’ But she isn’t angry. She knows she can fix this. Avni remembers this from her own childhood. Laundry’s an easy thing to fix. Her mother calls. She doesn’t pick up and she feels guilty about it. She doesn’t want to fight.
    
    They’d fought frequently when she was young: about Avni’s weight and her face and her body and her birth. They were very good at fighting – they always said things that were mean and true. Avni would say something mean and true, like, ‘You’re just a mother,’ and Mother would say something meaner and truer, like, ‘I was going to leave your father but I got pregnant with you.’ Then Avni would run away to the terrace and pretend that Aishwarya Rai was her real mother, that any minute she’d show up in a white stretch limousine and take her away.
    
    Avni strokes the cat’s white patches. The cat blinks at her, and she blinks back. She’d heard that slow-blinking is a way of saying ‘I love you’.
    
    When the cat wanders away she goes back upstairs. Dating apps. Wellness drinks. Travel agents. Paint. Bridal lehengas. Coffee. Gold. Food delivery. Dabbawala delivery. Third Mother sent mooli ke parathe and thecha. The parathe are soft and flaky. The thecha is sour and spicy and tingles all the inside walls of her mouth. Her co-workers buy food from the trolley like she used to, but she finds it bland now. Lacking salt. She cries on the bus home. There’s the salt. She licks her stinging lips and thinks of Mother.
    
    ‘Tell me about her,’ Third Mother says, when Avni explains why she’s been crying.
    
    ‘She was a size four her whole life,’ Avni says. ‘Except when she was pregnant with me, and then she was a size eight. She was a bad cook but a good baker. She never let me lick the spoon. Her Victoria Sponge was so soft you hardly had to chew. She didn’t love my father until she had me, and then she had two choices, and loving him was easier. She loved yoga and she could carry her whole body on the palms of her hands like a crow. She didn’t have any friends except me. I was her only friend. She thought Saif Ali Khan’s voice was sexy. And she sang to me most nights.’
    
    ‘She sounds nice,’ Third Mother says.
    
    They hug for the first time. Third Mother’s arms circle her shoulders loosely, cautiously. Avni finds it lacking.
    
    In the morning they brush their teeth side by side, spit-spit-gargle-spit. The Colgate is minty-fresh and the shower is freshly wet and the bathroom smells like mehndi. They drink chai on the balcony, then Avni drives Third Mother back to the shelter.
    
    In the car she whites and wilts and asks what she has done wrong. Avni notices newly the way her hair catches a copper tang under sunlight, like Aishwarya Rai in 2008. She doesn’t know what to say.
    
    The shelter people fuss over Third Mother and give each other knowing looks. ‘Perhaps,’ they suggest gently. ‘You might try an older mother? One with more training and experience?’
    
    The shelter houses one hundred and fifty women who used to be or long to be or have no choice but to be Mothers. They live in small double rooms with identical furniture. They cook together in a common kitchen and grow tulsi plants on the windowsill. On Sundays they sit in a long line that winds its way past the rooms and around all the living room furniture. They oil and braid each other’s hair. Avni did high school community service hours here. They seem happy enough to her.
    
    ‘All right,’ she decides. ‘I’ll give it a shot.’
    
    They bring out a tall, unsmiling woman with white hair pinned behind her ears.
    
    ‘Avni,’ they say. ‘This is Nazneen.’
    
    And so Nazneen becomes the fourth mother. She is significantly older than all the other mothers. Practically a grandmother. She is stern, but when Avni drives them home she rolls her window down and sticks her head out to feel the breeze. Then she laughs and laughs like a child.
    
    Nazneen makes different food than Third Mother had. Lots of meat, cheap cuts but perfectly cooked so they fall off the bone. She is from Hyderabad and she buys whole chickens straight from the butcher. She makes Avni learn how to clean and cut.
    
    ‘It’s gross and sad,’ Avni says. ‘I don’t want to do it.’
    
    ‘If you want to eat you will cook,’ Nazneen replies, unfazed. ‘You have got yourself a mother, not a maid.’
    
    She places the chicken on a wooden chopping board. ‘See,’ she says, indicating where with her big knife. ‘If you can, always cut through the joints instead of the bones.’
    
    Avni watches as she makes clean lines across the body of the chicken until it is disassembled and what’s left looks less like bird and more like meat.
    
    ‘This knife is not sharp enough,’ Nazneen observes. ‘Got it?’
    
    Avni nods. Her mother calls and she hits ignore.
    
    Nazneen’s face softens. She cuts breast, thighs, drumsticks, wings into small, fairly even pieces. ‘This is called karahi cut,’ she says. ‘Your mother never taught you?’
    
    ‘No,’ Avni says. ‘She must have thought other things were more important.’ ‘Like what?’
    
    Avni shrugs. ‘I don’t know,’ she says, picking up a piece of raw chicken and squishing it between her fingers.
    
    Nazneen thwacks her hand with the hilt of the knife and she puts it back down. Nazneen says, ‘Tell me more.’
    
    ‘There’s nothing to tell,’ Avni says, pressing her damp, sticky fingers together. ‘My mother never really cared for food. And I think I was a disappointing child.’
    
    She was not a beautiful child. The last time she had spoken to her mother, she had been on her knees. They were doing yoga together in her mother’s spare room. Child’s pose. Avni couldn’t fold herself forward far enough for her forehead to touch the floor then, either. Her stomach got in the way. Mother had been genuinely sad. She had said, ‘You look nothing like me.’
    
    The chicken karahi has less salt than Avni is now used to, but it’s moist and delicate and she hardly has to chew. She swallows; Nazneen pretends not to see her tears. It goes down easy, and there’s the salt.
    
    They do dishes before bed. Avni scrubs, Nazneen rinses.
    
    Nazneen doesn’t snore, so Avni feels extra alone in the nights. She can’t sleep again. She paces the flat and tries to regulate her breathing. Over and over, she counts down. Five things she can see, four things she can feel, three things she can hear, two things she can smell, one thing she can taste. She watches people smoking from the kitchen window. She chews on ice; she throws away the weighing scale.
    
    ‘I heard you,’ Nazneen says in the morning. ‘Do you often sleep badly?’
    
    ‘Yes,’ Avni says, stirring instant coffee into her bubbling milk.
    
    ‘Does anything help?’
    
    Avni shakes her head. ‘Nothing you can do.’
    
    ‘Something for another mother, perhaps?’ Nazneen guesses.
    
    Avni takes her coffee to go.
    
    At work she gets to observe a shoot for the first time. She is tired and jittery and building a booth with thick black cloth in the lobby of an ugly high-rise near Atria Mall. She stands in for the model while the cameramen set up their lights. She moves as instructed to. She flinches at the flash. She closes her eyes when the lights get too bright.
    
    ‘You, move!’ someone yells.
    
    When Avni opens her eyes, there, two feet away, surrounded by hair and makeup ladies, dressed in all-white with strings of pearls wrapped around her swanny neck, wind machine blowing her hair dramatically back, is Aishwarya Rai.
    
    The shoot takes hours. Aishwarya turns this way and that, offers long, slow, catlike blinks to the cameras. She is selling ‘Volume Shocking Mascara’ and it is shocking how beautiful she is. Avni tries to lock eyes, tries to slow blink back at her.
    
    They break for lunch and someone brings around chutney-cheese sandwiches for the crew. Aishwarya sits on one of those high makeup chairs and feeds herself a Caesar salad. Avni watches. The pieces of romaine are too big. Oh no. They’re smudging her perfect makeup. Her personal assistant is putting on a pair of disposable gloves. Her personal assistant is ripping each romaine leaf into smaller bites, one by one by one.
    
    ‘Chai?’ someone says.
    
    Avni takes it without shifting her gaze. She drinks without shifting her gaze. She spills chai on her white shirt and says, ‘Shit!’
    
    Aishwarya hears; Aishwarya sees.
    
    Avni doesn’t know what to do now that they are actually holding eye contact. She slow-blinks. Aishwarya’s eyes narrow, but she does not blink back. From somewhere else in the room, the director claps his hands loudly and Aishwarya disappears under a fluster of people armed with cotton pads and makeup brushes and bobby pins.
    
    Avni dabs at her shirt but she only makes the stain worse.
    
    Her boss’s boss’s intern, a skinny man in skinny jeans and a ganji, comes up to her and says they don’t need her anymore. She can leave.
    
    ‘But what if I don’t want to leave yet,’ she protests, holding the shirt away from her body and squeezing. A few drops of chai fall to the floor.
    
    ‘Sorry,’ he shrugs. ‘Aishwarya Ma’am wants you gone.’
    
    ‘No,’ Avni says, letting the fabric go. It falls back onto her body, sticks wetly to her stomach. ‘Why?’
    
    The intern tugs at his own ganji uncomfortably. ‘She said you scared her?’ he says, like a question.
    
    In Avni’s head, an image reverses: a white stretch limousine pulls up outside a middle-class apartment building in Panvel, Aishwarya Rai inside. The passenger door opens, then closes. The limo speeds off. A young girl picks herself up off the ground and watches as it disappears.
    
    ‘Aishwarya,’ Avni says, while the intern tries to tug her away. ‘Aishwarya, I’m sorry!’
    
    From the middle of all the make-up artists and hairstylists, a long, pale arm extends outwards and rises up like a kind of deity. It offers a graceful red carpet wave. Goodbye.
    
    Avni drives home in a very regular sized Maruti Suzuki.
    
    When she arrives, Nazneen is at the dining table. She has found Avni’s old photo albums and is looking through them carefully.
    
    ‘Hey,’ Avni says, reaching for the book. ‘No.’
    
    She flips, unrepentant. ‘Is this your mother?’ she asks. ‘It must be. You look just like her.’
    
    Avni sucks in a breath. She sits down. ‘I don’t want to talk about her,’ she says.
    
    Nazneen closes the book. ‘I do,’ she says. ‘Do you want to tell me what’s wrong?’
    
    ‘Not really.’ Avni gets up and moves to the kitchen. Nazneen follows her in. She takes off her shirt and stands over the sink in her bra. The Vim is running out, she notices. She drips what’s left onto the top and turns on the geyser, then the tap. Scrub-a-dub-dub. When she bends over she feels her stomach curve and expand over the waistband of her pants.
    
    ‘Why don’t you call her back,’ Nazneen says.
    
    ‘I can’t let the stain set,’ she replies.
    
    Nazneen takes off her dupatta and drapes it over Avni’s shoulders. She says, ‘I would like you to take me back to the shelter.’
    
    ‘What,’ Avni says, dropping the shirt. ‘Why?’
    
    ‘You should be using Surf for this. Never mind.’ Nazneen takes over. She switches off the geyser and turns the tap to the coldest temperature. She soaks the stain. A few minutes pass. She says, ‘I don’t think I am the right mother for you, Avni.’
    
    Avni laughs. ‘What a shit day this is,’ she says. She pulls the dupatta over her body and covers herself.
    
    ‘I am sorry to upset you,’ Nazneen says, switching off the tap and wringing the shirt with all the ferocity of a TurboDry until the excess water has sweated out. ‘But I don’t think you will find what you are looking for in a new mother.’
    
    Avni says, ‘Let me put on a shirt.’
    
    The shelter people are tired of her, Avni can tell. What is wrong this time, they ask, and why has she returned, and does she understand adoption is a serious lifetime commitment?
    
    Avni says she is very sorry for troubling them and lets Nazneen go.
    
    Nazneen doesn’t try to hug her. She takes her hand and holds it just long enough for Avni’s to feel warmed.
    
    ‘You must have been a good mother,’ Avni tells her.
    
    Nazneen smiles. ‘You say that because you are not my daughter.’
    
    In the house, Avni finds her white t-shirt drying on the balcony that has been unused since she took Third Mother back. It is spotless, as if the stain was never there. As if the chai had never spilled. Somehow she knows that she could have done exactly what Nazneen did and still made everything worse instead of better. Something-something mother’s touch.
    
    She goes to bed without eating and she can’t sleep. Her stomach feels like it is being wrung dry and her head is on a spin cycle, being vigorously washed. Scrub-a-dub-dub. She draws her legs up to her chest. She clenches her muscles, she breathes in, she unclenches her muscles, she breathes out. She picks up her phone and calls her mother back.
    
    ‘I didn’t call you to fight,’ she says as soon as Mother picks up.
    
    ‘I know why you called,’ Mother says. ‘I can always tell.’
    
    ‘Sorry,’ she says, and feels better already.
    
    ‘You can’t do like this,’ Mother tells her. ‘Calling me only when you need me.’
    
    Avni closes her eyes and decides to say something mean and true just one more time. ‘If I call you when I hurt,’ she says, ‘you make it better. If I call you when I’m not hurting, you make it worse.’
    
    Mother says, ‘Well,’ and blows her nose loudly.
    
    ‘Sorry,’ Avni repeats. The breath on the other end of the line tells her Mother is still there. She pictures her, in bed at this hour, in one of those thin cotton nighties she buys from Love Lady every spring. For better or worse, she knows Mother as well as Mother knows her.
    
    ‘Do you want to hear about my day?’ Mother asks finally. ‘Do you want me to sing for you?’
    
    ‘Yes,’ Avni says. Her head slows down. She uncurls her legs slowly and evens out her breathing. She stretches out so her whole body is flat against the mattress. ‘Please.’
    
    And Mother starts to speak, and Mother starts to sing."

    "text": "This fine creature falling into your lap when you were sixty-two and looked it and felt it was no hardship. Jean just needed to get the hang of things, that was all. Lily was an orphan in every regard – apart from the embarrassing fact there were two parents extant. To say they were not up to the job was to mock the notion of employment. Eleanor, the mother, a walking catastrophe – her self-murdering zeal matched only by a talent for staying alive. The wolf lived permanently at her door without quite reaching the upper chambers. The father – a complete nothing – to the extent one didn’t know his name.

    There was something about Lily going out into the world, a girl in a hoody with a basket in the forest, hem of her dress caught up in her fingertips, heart pried open so you could almost hear the pumping of her heroic (O positive!) blood type, urging her to receive life without judgement or grudges or speculation . . . Perhaps that was what was unbearable, the sense she would get mashed and pulped like all the other bright heroines, if Jean took her eye off her.
    
    She hadn’t had such worries with her own child. Louisa wasn’t vulnerable she was solid, thoughtless, flushed-cheeked, curly of hair. Like a small red car in an Enid Blyton she was self-reliant, forward-moving. She was lucky and had a tendency to land on her feet, whereas Lily stepped through rooms on tiptoe, peering behind her for ghosts. Powered by whirrings of bright moral energy, a ripe determination to emerge unscathed – those were strong things – but was it enough?
    
    The facts were sharp if not entirely clear. As luck would or wouldn’t have it, Lily had been brought up since late babyhood by Ruth, her grandmother. Seven weeks before her last breath Ruth asked Jean if she would take Lily on. They were not family but best friends of long-standing, colleagues at the coalface of the blackboard wiper, sober doler-outers of the detention baguette. Ruth’s voice struck an elaborately casual note, as one might ask, before a journey, if a neighbour could shake a hose at the sweet williams or put out and roll back the Wednesday bins. She spoke as though there was a possibility of a no, which there was not.
    
    ‘Sure,’ Jean said, matching Ruth in tone.
    
    ‘Sure? ’ the word was queried, found wanting, condemned.
    
    ‘It would be a great honour,’ Jean bowed.
    
    ‘Thank you.’
    
    She promised Ruth, at the end, she would not let anything bad happen. ‘Not on my watch,’ Jean said. ‘No! Never! No way!’ Who in their right mind dished out such pronouncements? Frank Sinatra? Lily would thrive and Eleanor would stay alive. Jean rubber-stamped it. Had they actually shaken hands? But Jean’s night self, which was less staunch than her day self, wanted some backup, some heavies, some sentinels. So here she was going to sleep singing ‘For Those in Peril on the Sea’. And sometimes ‘Those in Peril or at Sea’ to broaden its application.
    
     
    
    *
    
     
    
    ‘Idon’t want her to feel unentitled to mind things,’ Ruth was saying. She was propped up in the hospital bed, clipboard at the foot, clipboard at the head, as though the bed itself were conducting a thorough survey. Two winded pillows barely reached four inches thick. ‘Days not weeks,’ the doctor said, a certain shyness round the well-worn death sentence. Minding things was an entitlement, Jean pondered it. It was a step up from suffering; it was the belief your suffering was unjust. That you weren’t afraid to show you thought something of yourself. Very important. (Of course, some people made a blood sport out of minding everything – so dreary.)
    
    ‘That it wouldn’t destroy anyone if she thought now and then she had been dealt a cruel hand,’ Ruth spoke slowly but her diction was immaculate.
    
    ‘You have never been cruel.’
    
    ‘I know, but a start in life ought to be more solid.’
    
    ‘Yours wasn’t.’
    
    ‘Still. She may need at some point to allow herself to wail and flop a bit.’
    
    ‘These things can’t be forced.’
    
    ‘I don’t know. They can be accommodated.’
    
    Oh. So I’m to accommodate the unspeakable things because you did not? Jean moved the words round her mouth with stealth. Instead, ‘She will need buffers. Mechanisms to hand that will help. But of course she may be that rare soul with the kind of hardware to weather tough things. In which case that tendency, that infrastructure, should be respected.’
    
    ‘Christ, Jean! Buffers? Infrastructure? You hate resilience. You think it’s a racket. That it’s what’s expected from those who aren’t treated well. They’ll put it on your headstone!
    
    ‘OK. God! You’re impossible!’
    
    They both laughed.
    
    ‘Sorry,’ Ruth said.
    
    ‘No, I’m sorry,’ Jean said. ‘I suppose I want to tie things neatly in a bow.’
    
    ‘Well you can pack that in for a start.’
    
    ‘Understood.’
    
    ‘Isn’t it great we can still drive each other mad?’
    
    ‘I agree. I think it’s very authentic of us.’
    
    Then – ‘How will she grieve me?’ Ruth asked.
    
    What a question!
    
    ‘I wish I could slip away, so she wouldn’t notice. How could I wound her like this?’
    
    ‘It doesn’t work like that.’
    
    ‘I’ve let her down.’
    
    ‘I don’t see it that way.’
    
    ‘I do.’
    
     
    
    Later when Ruth woke, Jean steadied herself. She had a speech prepared and practised in the visitor’s chair. Trial and error, a good deal of editing, a passable dress rehearsal with moving lips. ‘I’ve a good plan,’ she said. ‘Would you like me to say what I think we would –’
    
    ‘Please.’
    
    ‘Well, we will miss and mourn you together. We’ll celebrate you as we do our teeth and drink our morning tea. You’ll top and tail our days.’
    
    ‘But how will you actually –?’
    
    It was evening now – a crescent moon, very still, in the corner of the window like a stamp. Ruth said it looked Parisian. One of the side lights in the ward was on the blink. It cast a queer throbbing intensity over the dangerous talk. A man in a blue boiler suit was up a ladder, fiddling away, quite merry.
    
    Jean reeled off her list like a little poem. It was as though she was scaling a tall glass building, but she tried for a restful atmosphere. ‘We’ll speak of you every day. We’ll continue some of your favourite routines and make the food you made and read the books you loved. We’ll walk through London parks, marvelling at all the different greens. We will cook now and then from Elizabeth David although, as you know, I’m not big on her superior tone. We’ll get out letters and photographs of you on Sunday afternoons, if there’s nothing decent on TV. We’ll come and visit you to say hello or when we have news, good or bad, and we’ll sit on the bench and fill you in on what’s going on at school and in the world. What’s on special at the supermarket! And we’ll bring coffee and viennoiserie sometimes to where you rest and just sit and chat there, showering you with croissant crumbs. We might sing, if you can stomach it, I know you’re not a fan of my country and western side. We may suggest we have read more than we have to impress you, so you can discount twenty-five per cent of our claims. If I say I’ve learned Russian to read Chekhov in the original you can take it with a pinch of salt. We’ll laugh and we’ll have a cry, I might bring the travel backgammon in case boredom sets in. We will have cream cheese and cucumber sandwiches and slot plain crisps inside for the crunch factor. That do you?’
    
    ‘Oh oh oh!’ Ruth murmured. There was pleasure there. Strong pleasure, weakly expressed. Jean stood and leaned over the bedside. She held out her hand and stroked Ruth’s hair. She thought suddenly of babies’ hair, the way when their hair first came in it didn’t always look real.
    
    ‘Oh yes, and I forgot, we’ll plant snowdrop bulbs beside you; I’ll order a load of them when I get home. They should be up nicely by mid-Jan. And we can put in something more scented and frothy for the spring, Lily can choose it, but I’ll steer her away from yellow, if I may. Soft blues and lilacs would be more my –
    
    ‘And I will answer any questions that she has about her life, and your life. I’ll do it carefully, laying things out little by little. And I’ll wait to be asked, like we said.’
    
    Jean exhaled and cast her eyes about the ward. It was one of the more difficult exams she had taken.
    
    Ruth was beginning to look uneasy. Had she under-delivered? Had she over-? There was something crass in giving all the details. It was always better to preserve your mystery. Were there omissions that grated? Had she hoped for more sorrow in the delivery? Did she require mention of black garments – on a child? Jean put her hand gently to her mouth to convey she didn’t blame it. She wasn’t going down that road.
    
    The sadness was spreading thickly between them now. Words couldn’t do anything, not really.
    
     
    
    After school, Lily arrived at the hospital. She often took refuge in the lavatories on the ward, disappearing for ten minutes or so, the days in need of breaking up and brokering. Her face damp and glistening on her return gave Jean the idea that she splashed herself for courage, taking time to think and feel the things necessary to her emotional privacy. But one couldn’t know. It might have been the remnants of tears, or steps taken to hide or dilute them. She came back refreshed-looking in any case. She was professional in that way, not in the sense of being controlled or businesslike, but in knowing what she needed. She was respected by the hospital staff who looked her up and down with great approval. They addressed their comments to her in the main – family had a higher status to friends in a hospital setting – but she was only fifteen. There was a lozenge-shaped pink patch of dry skin under Lily’s chin, and she rubbed away at it without seeming to notice. It expressed a form of physical sympathy with Ruth’s state, Jean thought. A dab of Vaseline ought to do the trick. Perhaps when they got home she ought to – no, it would be better coming in the morning.
    
    The doctor made his evening rounds, the tall, grand English one. His august look held both glamour and humility. ‘More like three or four days, now, I’m afraid.’ Then: ‘Less than a week, certainly.’ He lingered for some sort of civilised response. Jean rose to her feet, but she could not speak.
    
    ‘OK then. Fair enough,’ Lily murmured, nodding, meeting the doctor with a cool thin smile. That was incredible. The way she took it upon herself to lead them all into this new phase. Such maturity and authority. And if Lily could accept it, it meant they all could/must follow suit. So now it was just about how to colour in those precious hours. Just!
    
     
    
    Little tableaux from the past bobbed about them all the time, marking the scene for future memory. When Lily was small, five or six, something difficult happened, Jean half remembered, to do with her mother, it always was, who had shown up in bad order, or more likely not shown up at all. There was some kind of ensuing episode or confrontation, and Ruth took it hard, which was unusual, and had to go to bed for a time. Jean was put in charge of taking Lily on an outing, but on being asked what she’d like, Lily thought she was being quizzed about a present, and had spoken, if it wasn’t too expensive, of a new nail varnish she fancied. The shade was called Sunflower Mist; the stockist the chemist next to the laundrette. With ceremony, not quite marching but almost, they went and bought it, took it to a bright cafe.
    
    They ordered hot chocolates, not too sweet as Lily liked it, and she did them both with concentration, as good as a nail bar, pushing back Jean’s cuticles with an orange stick she brought from home, massaging the nail beds with the edges of the napkin, applying the colour with the tiny brush in three even strokes. The yellow had a greenish tinge, more Van Gogh’s chair than his sunflowers, the shade of Jean’s-Ex-Alan’s fingertips before he gave up smoking, Jean remarked. Still, Lily was thrilled. The atmosphere between them deepened. It was a powerful connection to have matching nails. Jean asked her if she felt OK, what with her mother coming round in a bad way or not coming when she had said she would or whatever it was that had gone awry – ‘It’s got to be tough to take’ – and Lily said, quite sensibly, ‘It’s cheered me down, Jean.’
    
     
    
    Jean fell for her then. She reached for something outlandish such as, ‘From now on instead of Jean will you call me . . . Gigi?’ but it might have pissed Ruth off, the wanting and organising of a special name. It smacked of that dread phrase ‘Our little secret’. It was enough their nails were twinned. Still – tempting.
    
    Gigi though, Jean rolled her eyes now, looking at Lily on the other side of the bay. What on earth had she been thinking? Gigi, my arse.
    
    Jean watched Lily approach the nurses’ station, take the nurse in charge to one side asking if it wasn’t time for a syringe driver. The nurse said no, not yet. There wasn’t any discernible breakthrough pain, apparently. How on earth did Lily know about syringe drivers? Jean was amazed.
    
    ‘I don’t think we should wait until there’s breakthrough pain,’ Lily said. ‘That would be bad, if we left it that late. No. Can we revisit tomorrow when the doctor does his rounds?’
    
    Revisit! What a mild and elegant way of saying I don’t agree.
    
    The day before, while Ruth slept fitfully, Jean and Lily had a conversation about ‘life-savers’. ‘When someone doesn’t see things my way,’ Jean said, ‘I used to tell them to get lost but now I just say,’ she sweetened her voice to benign automaton setting, ‘ “Do you have any flexibility?” And although it’s less satisfying I seem to get better results.’
    
    ‘Like wiggle room,’ Lily said, her face creasing. ‘Or is it wriggle room? I’m never sure.’
    
    ‘It’s wiggle,’ Jean said. ‘Easy to remember because a wiggle is a small flexible movement whereas a wriggle . . . a wriggle room would be a room in which to twist and writhe!’
    
    ‘Sounds good!’
    
    ‘Another one is, “What would you do if you were me?”, which is meant to get the other person to walk in your shoes. Swap allegiances,’ Jean said. ‘Change their perspective, at least. So they say.’
    
    ‘I heard Ruth say it on the telephone once. I don’t know if it worked. It was when my – when Eleanor was in the prison that time.’
    
    ‘Oh yes,’ Jean said. She heard her breathing coarsen. ‘I remember how unusually warm it was, that autumn, sometimes even hot, until halfway through November . . .’
    
     
    
    ‘Did you know I was born here?’
    
    ‘Yes I did know.’
    
    ‘SO cool!’ Lily said. ‘I might pop down to the baby place. Revisit the scenes of my earliest youth!’
    
    ‘Yep!’ Jean said. ‘Amazing!’ She closed her eyes. She’d heard of scenes she couldn’t stop herself animating – an infant trailing wires in a see-through box, skin crawling with sores and rashes, trembling unfocused limbs, despair. A babyscape ought to be soft and sweet but here there were only sharp-edged things. It was faintly pornographic in its crisis and craving. Failure and insufficiencies as far as the eye could see. It provoked in Jean a moral vertigo. She closed her eyes more tightly. It’s all right, she reassured. You’re beginning the grief I expect, that’s all. It’s starting.
    
    ‘What?’ Lily said. ‘What? Why have you gone all weird?’
    
    ‘I was . . . I was just thinking how the time flies, how it has flown, from that day to this. Incredible. All in the blink of an eye in the same building. One minute you’re down on the second floor and . . .’
    
    ‘OK?’ Lily said, grinning warily. ‘What have you done with Jean?’
    
    ‘What do you –’
    
    ‘Aren’t you the person I once heard say to the whole school in assembly, “Teenagers, they grow up so slow”?’
    
    ‘Well,’ Jean said. ‘I suppose I may have done. All right. All right. Got a laugh though, didn’t I?’
    
     
    
    The next day Ruth lay like a mound of ashes. Her mouth was a separate species though, the lips a good firm red, apart from some white marks that flecked the borders. She was not going to go quietly, that was certain. Odd when she’d never been exactly chatty before. Perhaps that was why it was necessary – shop now while stocks last. Unless the need for privacy was dying too . . . privacy had always been her dominion. Jean admired her for that. Her high, dry style – the things she bit down on habitually.
    
    ‘You won’t outdo me will you Jean?’
    
    ‘Well I’m going to outlive you, unless you’ve got a gun.’
    
    ‘No, I mean you won’t be so much better than me that you make me look awful.’
    
    ‘Of course I won’t. Wait – what?’
    
    ‘Can you mess up a bit, not do everything perfectly?’
    
    ‘These things happen naturally in households staffed by human people.’
    
    ‘It’s just your standards are higher than mine and you’re calmer and you’ve got money. And you’re cuddly and cosier too. You have a pink sofa and sweet things in pretty boxes in a cupboard.’
    
    ‘Everyone’s more cuddly than a cancer patient.’
    
    ‘Oh.’
    
    Then after a minute: ‘I mean, you’re being crazy. People idolise the dead! You’re not thinking straight.’
    
    ‘I don’t know.’
    
    ‘I’m not sure I can sign up to this. I know you want me to do my best for Lily. You said to knock myself out in every way. Think of the lists of instructions we drew up together. Twelve pages, single-spaced, both sides of the paper. Times New Roman! I am going to give it everything I’ve got – that’s the plan. Also, let us not forget, you don’t have any choice! There isn’t anybody else.’
    
    Ruth’s skin had altered subtly in tone and texture this last half-hour. Her arms had gone the colour of cement.
    
    ‘You’re just, you’re just feeling sorry for yourself!’
    
    ‘I am on my deathbed Jean.’
    
    ‘You don’t want me to fuck it up to make you look better. Not really. That’s not your style. Come on.’ Jean’s voice descended into its Tippex is the Devil timbre.
    
    ‘I’m so jealous. All the things I’m going to miss.’
    
    ‘Well – yes. I know.’
    
    ‘How can I compete?’
    
    ‘Well – but you’ve already given Lily the earth.’
    
    ‘It makes me think all sorts of terrible things about you.’
    
    ‘That’s all right. It’s normal. I can take it.’
    
    ‘It’s not very nice though.’
    
    ‘You’re going to need to die soon if you keep this up,’ Jean said.
    
    Ruth almost giggled but her face was watery against the parchment skin.
    
    ‘You know I think what I’m going to take from this little talk is that when I do err as I inevitably will, I’ll imagine you punching the air with the angels.’
    
    ‘I’m not much of an air puncher, though, am I? Could you imagine me clapping with them and their golden harps all in a row?’
    
    ‘Yes, I will, that’s much better. And I shall bow and feel the warmth of your approval beating down on my skin. That sound all right?’
    
    Ruth nodded painfully. There were vivid waves of pride and waves of shame. It had always been her currency, Jean thought. She pictured a passport with dual nationality.
    
     
    
    ‘There’s a girl in year seven at school,’ Jean began, ‘told me every night her big sister says to her, last thing, after they’ve done their teeth, “Night Sophie. Hope you die in your sleep.”’
    
    ‘Oh?’
    
    ‘Isn’t that . . . severe?’
    
    ‘Maybe she means I hope you die in your sleep when you’re an old lady, peacefully and not in pain or in a car accident or at the hands of some axe murderer. I hope you have a good death. It’s sweet.’
    
    ‘You think? She’s twelve years old.’
    
    ‘Well yes, I think so. Why not?’
    
    ‘Whatever you’re on can I have some?’
    
    Ruth pointed at two brown bottles on her nightstand. ‘Fill your boots.’
    
    ‘They just leave them lying about? I thought it was all under lock and key.’
    
    ‘Not really,’ Ruth said. ‘I’m not sure. The nurse does usually . . . there’s different stuff for different things. They bring round little paper cups.’
    
    ‘I see!’ Jean picked up the bottles and tried to read them but the writing was impossible.
    
    ‘Maybe I will try one,’ Jean said. ‘I need something. What’s that one there?’
    
    ‘A strong one, I think. Tramadol, or is it the other –? There’s the pale blue ones. Lovely colour. What’s that play where the man says “That’s a lovely shade of blue on your woolly”?’
    
    ‘Not sure. Is it Pinter maybe or more like Joe Orton? Whoever it was makes shade sound filthy!’
    
    ‘I know! And Gabapentin is the yellow ones with the numbers. Quite strong. I like that one. We could take it together, bit like holy communion?’
    
    ‘Ha! What time you due your next? We mustn’t be silly about it.’
    
    ‘I just wait until the nurse comes usually. It’s my favourite one today, Irene. She’s got four sisters in Jamaica but she is the cleverest and the most beautiful.’
    
    ‘Even so, she’s unlikely to hand out freebies to visitors. Or is there happy hour on Fridays?’
    
    ‘Is it Friday? That was quick. Thank God it’s Friday Jean!’
    
    ‘Maybe,’ Jean said. Then, ‘No I mustn’t, it’s irresponsible. What am I thinking?’
    
    ‘We are in a hospital.’
    
    ‘Yes, but we’re not in the business of creating more patients. The nurses don’t need extra dramas.’
    
    ‘But I never ring my bell or anything. Wouldn’t dream of it. Even if I was –’
    
    ‘I know. I know you wouldn’t . . . I, on the other hand . . .’
    
    ‘Yes, yes you would. Night and day.’
    
    The song ‘Night and Day’ hovered in the air between them, but neither had the heart to take the bait.
    
    Jean unscrewed the nearest brown bottle and lifted a yellow pill to her mouth. She imagined Ruth’s daughter Eleanor swinging onto the ward, putting on a bright brave blank face for her mother, although they all knew there was no saving things, not now. All the damage imprinted on Ruth’s flesh. Broken tissue scarred and inflamed. And that very odd thing indeed of no one ever judging her. Did they try hard not to, did it just come naturally?
    
     
    
    At home in the private solace of her sofa, Jean judged Eleanor mercilessly. She permitted herself little fetishised stints. They hit her system with force, like whipped cream folded into melted chocolate. She admired the judgements that she fashioned, the severity of their tone and tilt; above all their certainty. The wry internal musings of the critic. The sharp observations in the vocative case. What you put your mother through! The breathtaking cruelty of your leisure activities. Wrecking lives with no awareness or compunction. To dedicate your life to torturing others – what venomous career counselling did you attend? And forcing everyone to feel sorry for you in the process. Pitiful girl.
    
    Eleanor ruled through fear, left her mother and daughter routinely stunned and quaking. Afraid to answer the telephone. Afraid to take breaths. The amount of daily courage she exacted from them was an obscenity. Lily wearing yellow to prove she wasn’t crushed, dotting her i’s with hearts to convey optimism. What a strain to perform I’m all right with your every move, hopes pared back beyond what was decent, unable or unwilling to take the measure of the pain.
    
    Eleanor brought Ruth to her knees, kept her there, liked her there. And for what? To what aim? Jean flexed her strict beliefs before her like the founder of a cult. That Ruth also depended on opiates now was a parody of homecoming. Of leave-taking. What ugly parallels. Scoring in the morning, scoring in the evening. Jean shook her head with great bitterness. Still Ruth preferred parody to satire, she had said so more than once. Parody was playful. Less mean-spirited.
    
     
    
    Jean’s skin grew hot. It reddened with injustice. She held the pill from the nightstand against her lips in the spirit of can’t beat ’em join ’em. She saw three witches, in her imagination, ancient, cobwebbed and with red-rimmed eyes, but it was just Ruth, Eleanor and Jean when you looked closely – all lolling on the hospital bed singing songs and nodding out. Broomsticks ahoy! Night and Day. Death and Life. They would all go down or all go up together.
    
    The reality was, there was not a single spell left to be cast. A terrible Brecht poem called ‘I am Dirt’ sprang at Jean from God knows where. ‘Unfortunately, I had to do lots of things / That were harmful, purely to stay alive.’ The speaker took so many drugs she called herself a ‘bedsheet with no bones’. Sheets never have or have had bones, Jean was doubtful – but still the phrase had great power. It was how Eleanor was.
    
     
    
    The way Jean’s thoughts were going it was as though she was dying. She was too close to things. That was it. All of life was contagious. Of course your head would get muddled with the other person’s at the end. It was just the practical side of ‘for better or for worse’. That was friendship so much more than marriage. No one had a husband from seven to ninety but with women’s love it wasn’t even especially unusual. It would just merit an ‘Oh’ of recognition from another. No one would faint or anything.
    
    Lily arrived and sat with Ruth while Jean palmed the pill and made a raid on the vending machine. A four-finger KitKat detached from its coil and fell with a clunk to the grey trough at the base. Suddenly Jean lifted her hand and banged the glass front with her fist as though it had cheated her. Something was cheating her. Everything was. She didn’t stop beating until the whole machine rattled and began to emit a disastrous echoey wail. She nipped back to the ward in disgrace then, sitting on the blue vinyl chair at the edge of things, giving Ruth and Lily some privacy. She could see they were plotting something.
    
    I’ll get my mum here, leave it to me, no problem.
    
    God. Please not that.
    
    Lily came over to kiss them both goodbye. She was going to a friend’s for a sleepover. It was a good idea and Jean encouraged it. They must pace themselves. She could hold the fort. ‘I’ll ring you at Beth’s if I –’
    
    ‘Sure.’
    
    Jean gazed at Ruth in her parlous state. Perhaps Eleanor would come but in what condition? People being absent was more acutely felt by a certain type of individual than people being there. The tendrils of un-love went deeper. A disposition for grief. The impact had been searing, unforgettable, beyond endurance. There was nothing equal to it.
    
    She blinked and took in the facts of the room. Easy does it. Well done. It was routine for her to congratulate herself. Her high opinion was important. She named all the white things she could see on the ward: pillow, sheet, clipboard paper, teacup and saucer, Ruth’s ghost-face beginning to shut down. Ruth was peaceful in her slumbers. Concentrate, Jean told herself.
    
    She sat herself up, stiff in the visitor’s chair, the yellow pill still in her fingers. Sensible and calm now, she weighed things carefully. The truth was she could do with a lift, a break from all the pressure. Lily was off for the night, leaving Jean free to retire from the human race briefly. Saturday tomorrow – no school – excellent. It wasn’t an insane idea. The pill might help her sleep, which would be good. Sleep had become a complete stranger to her nights. She was feeling the strain now, all the time, no denying. Work hospital, work hospital, marking at the bedside, watching over Lily, helping Ruth get to the one thing she didn’t want. Fuck! This hinterland was stretching out for weeks and weeks. Aspects of her personality were becoming inoperable. She needed something. She popped the pill in her mouth – why not? And the way Ruth opened her eyes and shimmered with delight!
    
    ‘Oh no Jean stop! I’m so stupid. Christ! That’s Dulcolax.’
    
    Jean yanked it out with the tip of her little finger, scarlet nail nicking the fleshiest part of her gum. The pill was intact and still dry. ‘Ah, that I don’t need,’ she said.
    
    ‘Sorry about that.’
    
    ‘Never mind. No harm done. I wasn’t thinking.’
    
    ‘No you weren’t, I am a bit shocked.’
    
    ‘Good!’
    
     
    
    ‘You ever taken drugs much Jean?’
    
    ‘Well,’ she said. ‘I have and I haven’t. I had a very bad time with Dexedrine when I was young. Put me off for life. It was dreadful. I went mad for six weeks, but when you go mad you assume it’s forever. It was a shocking time.’
    
    ‘Why d’you take it?’
    
    ‘This,’ she said, grabbing a handful of belly.
    
    ‘Did you go very thin?’
    
    ‘It’s hard to know when you’re insane. They had to take me away in a van. It wasn’t pretty.’
    
    ‘Christ.’
    
    ‘Same thing happened to Muriel Spark! That was some consolation anyway. She wanted to get all slinky one Christmas, save money on her food bills – Dexedrine seemed the perfect answer. But one unexpected side effect – she got completely obsessed with T.S. Eliot! His most Christian play The Confidential Clerk – she thought it held special messages for her, beaming directly from T.S. himself. Then she started to believe he was communicating with her through the Times crossword.’
    
    ‘The Confidential Clerk? The crossword? Jean you’re making this up.’
    
    ‘No. It’s all there in black and white. All her hallucinations starred Eliot. Isn’t that just so chic? Then she convinced herself he’d taken a job as a window cleaner with some of her friends to get even closer. Rumour has it news reached him of her predicament and he wrote to her to say he wasn’t trying to reach her at all.’
    
    ‘Christ! Sending a message to say he wasn’t sending messages. Only a man!’
    
    ‘I know.’
    
    ‘Mine are mostly weddings and christenings.’
    
    ‘Well a hallucination ought to feature rites of passage I think. That sounds good and proper. I think it’s healthy.’ At her ‘healthy’, Jean winced. What the fuck is wrong with you?
    
    Snoozing happened to both of them then, Ruth’s head on the pillow, Jean’s nestled against the chair. It was very warm in the bay – Jean couldn’t help think free heating. And later, in the night, when the ward was lightless apart from a pale column of blue and almost dead apart from a pair of drowsy nurses, Jean woke and started whispering.
    
    ‘Hey! You knew all along about that pill! God I’m slow. You were teasing me. You beast!’
    
    Ruth stirred and rigged up a dim smile. Her eyes lit a little. Were there the dregs of mischief there?
    
    ‘Oh, I could kill you! You villain!’
    
    ‘Better get a move on then.’ Her voice was dry and sore and inhospitable.
    
    ‘Don’t . . .’
    
    And after a few minutes, ‘Jean?’
    
    ‘Yep?’
    
    ‘I do love you.’ Their fingers wove together hungry on the damp top sheet.
    
    ‘You’re not so bad yourself.’
    
     
    
    It was their last speaking.

    "text": "Originally I had planned to get to New York the normal way, fly there, but then Harris and I had gotten into an odd conversation with another couple at a party. Our friend Sonja said she loved to drive; she missed having the time to drive across the country. And Harris said, Well, that figures.

    What do you mean? we all said. Harris just shrugged, took a sip of his drink. He doesn’t talk much at parties. He hangs back, not needing anything from anyone, which of course draws people toward him. I’ve watched him move from room to room, running in slow motion from a crowd that is unconsciously chasing him.
    
    ‘Why does that figure?’ Sonja said, smiling. She wasn’t going to let this go. And maybe because it was her, so charming with her Auckland accent and big breasts, Harris suddenly laid out a fully formed theory.
    
    ‘Well, in life there are Parkers and there are Drivers,’ he began. ‘Drivers are able to maintain awareness and engagement even when life is boring. They don’t need applause for every little thing – they can get joy from petting a dog or hanging out with their kid and that’s enough. This kind of person can do cross‑country drives.’ He took a sip of his drink. Dogs were a hot‑button topic for us. Harris and Sam wanted one; I was ambivalent about pets in general. Are we totally sure about the domestication of animals? Will we not look back on this as a kind of slavery? But how to get out of it now when the world is so populated with dogs and cats that can’t fend for themselves? It’s not humane to just release them. It would have to be a group decision: No more pets after this. This is the last round of them. But that was never going to happen, even if everyone agreed with me, and literally no one did. Being anti‑pet (pro‑animal!) was one of my least winning qualities.
    
    ‘Parkers, on the other hand’ – and he looked at me – ‘need a discrete task that seems impossible, something that takes every bit of focus and for which they might receive applause. ‘Bravo,’ someone might say after they fit the car into an especially tight spot. ‘Amazing.’ The rest of the time they’re bored and fundamentally kind of . . .’ He looked at the ceiling, trying to think of the right word. ‘Disappointed. A Parker can’t drive across the country. But Parkers are good in emergencies,’ he added. ‘They like to save the day.’
    
    ‘I’m definitely a Parker,’ said Sonja’s husband. ‘I love to save the day.’
    
    ‘Wait, parking is exciting?’ said Sonja. ‘That seems counterintuitive. Wouldn’t driving –’
    
    ‘Think about it, hon, you have to get the angle just right –’
    
    ‘Okay, but are Drivers boring? I don’t want to be the boring, dependable kind of person.’
    
    ‘No, not at all,’ said Harris. ‘Drivers can have a good time more easily. That’s not boring.’
    
    ‘I want to be a Parker,’ Sonja said, pouting. ‘Too late,’ Harris said. ‘You can’t switch.’
    
    At this point I peeled away from the conversation. Message received. Harris and Sonja were grounded, easy going, people who liked to pet dogs and have sex whenever. And I was a Parker. What he called disappointed was really just depressed. I’d been a little blue recently, not a lot of fun around the house. Not like Sonja. I watched the two of them chatting – his barrel chest and graying black curls somehow looked boyish and his level of animation was totally unfamiliar to me, I guess she brought that out in him. It wasn’t jealousy exactly; being a third wheel is my native state. Sometimes Harris will seem to have rapport with a waitress or a cashier and I immediately cede to them as a couple – I internally step aside and give my place to the other woman, just for a few seconds, until the transaction is over.
    
    There was a small group of people dancing in the living room. I moved discreetly at first, getting my bearings, then the beat took hold and I let my vision blur. I fucked the air. All my limbs were in motion, making shapes that felt brand‑new. My skirt was tight, my top was sheer, my heels were high. The people around me were nodding and smiling; I couldn’t tell if they were embarrassed for me or actually impressed. The host’s father looked me up and down and winked – he was in his eighties. Was that how old a person had to be to think I was hot these days? I moved deeper into the crowd, shut my eyes, and slid side to side, shoulder first, like I was protecting stolen loot. Now I added a fist like a brawler, punching. I made figure eights with my ass at what felt like an incredible speed while holding my hands straight up in the air like I’d just made a goal. When I eventually opened my eyes I saw Harris across the room, watching. I could tell from his face that he thought I was being ‘unnecessarily provocative’. Or maybe I was projecting my parents onto him – that’s more something my mom would say – but he’s always leaned a bit traditional. On our second date I began revealing my peep show past the same way I always did, like a verbal striptease, until I noticed his face kind of shutting down. At which point I immediately began reversing the story, narratively putting my clothes back on, as it were, and minimizing the whole thing – a youthful misstep! Ancient history!
    
    Now he touched two fingers to his forehead and I did the same, relieved. We’d done this saluting thing the first time we ever laid eyes on each other and across many crowded rooms ever since. There you are. He didn’t look away. Dancers kept moving between us, but he held on for a moment longer, we both did. I smiled a little but this wasn’t really about happiness; it hit below fleeting feelings. At this slight remove all our formality falls away, revealing a mutual and steadfast devotion so tender I could have cried right there on the dance floor. Sure, he’s good‑looking, unflappable, insightful, but none of that would mean anything without this strange, almost pious, loyalty between us. Now we both knew to turn away. Other couples might have crossed the room toward each other and kissed, but we understood the feeling would disappear if we got too close. It’s some kind of Greek tragedy, us, but not all told.
    
    I wandered off the dance floor and into the master bathroom, washing my hands with the host’s facial cleanser. Of course it wasn’t too late to switch from Parker to Driver – anyone with a driver’s license could drive across the country. I could see myself pulling up in to the driveway with dusty tires, Sam running to greet me and Harris just standing in the doorway. He’d salute and I’d salute, but this time I’d walk into his arms, knowing I was finally home in a way I’d never been before.
    
    By morning the idea had taken hold. Why fly to New York when I could drive and finally become the sort of chill, grounded woman I’d always wanted to be? This could be the turning point of my life. If I lived to be ninety I was halfway through. Or if you thought of it as two lives, then I was at the very start of my second life. I imagined a vision quest – style journey involving a cave, a cliff, a crystal, maybe a labyrinth and a golden ring.
    
    ‘I’ve driven across the country,’ said Jordi. ‘It’s not that great.’
    
    ‘It’s not supposed to be! Is a silent meditation retreat “great”? Do people hike the Pacific Crest Trail because it’s “great”? And this is even higher stakes because if my mind wanders too far I’ll crash and die.’
    
    ‘Oh god, don’t say that.’
    
    ‘But my mind won’t wander! I’ll be totally present all the way there and all the way back. And for the rest of my life I’ll tell people about this cross‑country drive I did when I was forty‑five. That’s when I finally learned to just be myself.’
    
    Of course I was always myself with Jordi; she knew I meant be myself at home. All the time.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Harris had found an old foldout map of the United States and was tracing his finger across it. ‘If you take the southern route you can go through New Mexico and spend the night in Las Cruces.’ I was holding a plastic hairbrush and trying to focus on all the red and blue squiggles, but my eyes bounced off them.
    
    ‘Couldn’t I just put New York City into my Google Maps?’
    
    ‘But there are different ways to go. Different routes.’
    
    He said I should take an extra week so the drive wouldn’t eat into my New York days.
    
    ‘Really? That’s more than two weeks without you guys.’ I had never been apart from Sam for that long. Each time they ran past us I tried to hand them the hairbrush; surely at seven one could be the steward of one’s own tangly hair.
    
    ‘Well, you don’t want to drive for a week and then just turn around and come home. You should really take three weeks to make it worth your while.’
    
    ‘Three weeks? No, that would definitely be too long apart.’ He was being generous because I had done a lot of childcare recently while he worked with his twenty‑seven‑year‑old protégée, Caro. Is protégée the right word? Ingenue, whatever. He’s a record producer, which is actually ideal – there’s no competition between us but he knows what an artistic soul needs. Early on I called her Caroline; Caro felt too intimate, like a pet name.
    
    (‘Only the press calls her Caroline,’ Harris had said.)
    
    (‘That’s fine. I don’t mind being like the press.’)
    
    But it wasn’t just that he owed me childcare; Harris doesn’t have a lot of conflicted feelings vis‑à‑vis the domestic sphere. I didn’t either until we had a baby. Harris and I were just two workaholics, fairly equal. Without a child I could dance across the sexism of my era, whereas becoming a mother shoved my face right down into it. A latent bias, internalized by both of us, suddenly leapt forth in parenthood. It was now obvious that Harris was openly rewarded for each thing he did while I was quietly shamed for the same things. There was no way to fight back against this, no one to point a finger at, because it came from everywhere. Even walking around my own house I felt haunted, fluish with guilt about every single thing I did or didn’t do. Harris couldn’t see the haunting and this was the worst part: to be living with someone who fundamentally didn’t believe me and was really, really sick of having to pretend to empathize – or else be the bad guy! In his own home! How infuriating for him. And how infuriating to be the wife and not other women who could enjoy how terrific he was. How painful for both of us, especially given that we were modern, creative types used to living in our dreams of the future. But a baby exists only in the present, the historical, geographic, economic present. With a baby one could no longer be cute and coy about capitalism – money was time, time was everything. We could have skipped lightly across all this by not becoming parents; it never really had to come to a head. On the other hand, sometimes it’s good when things come to a head. And then eventually, one day: pop.
    
    Harris was using a highlighter directly on the map and telling me I could always decide later to stay a few extra days.
    
    ‘That’s the great thing about driving; you can play it by ear.’ He could be generous like this for the reasons I just explained. Not me! I always wanted him back right on the dot – extended trips, school holidays, a child being too sick to go to school, these things run a chill down the spines of working mothers whose freedom is so precarious to begin with. Still, I loved this about Harris, how he always encouraged me to stay longer and have fun. I reminded him I had to be back by the fifteenth anyway. Of course, he said; obviously.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Jordi and I were sipping milkshakes; mine strawberry, hers chocolate. Once a week we meet in her studio and eat junk together. Usually desserts we’d eaten as kids but almost never again since we’d discovered the healing power of whole grains and fermented foods and how sugar was basically heroin. This was part of a larger agreement to never become rigid, to maintain fluidity in diet and all things. At home I baked high‑protein, date‑sweetened treats. No one knew about our medicinal junk food, are you kidding? Harris and Sam would both be jealous, each in their own way. Similarly, I never told Harris what I jerked off to.
    
    ‘But maybe you guys could role‑play it?’ Jordi suggested. ‘Do you guys role‑play?’
    
    ‘Never.’
    
    ‘We don’t, either.’
    
    We decided then to tell each other exactly how a typical fuck played out in our marriages. We couldn’t believe we’d never done this before. If there was a good reason, neither of us could think of it.
    
    ‘Who initiates? You, right?’ I knew she was that sort of totally present, body‑rooted lover who felt like sex was a basic need.
    
    ‘Yes,’ she sighed, ‘it’s always me.’
    
    ‘I’m the initiator, too, actually, but only because I’m trying to get out ahead of the pressure.’
    
    ‘How often?’
    
    ‘Once a week.’
    
    ‘Wow,’ she moaned. ‘I wish I was having sex once a week!’ I laughed. We were so opposite.
    
    ‘I see it like exercise,’ I said. ‘You don’t ask yourself if you want to exercise, that’s the wrong question.’
    
    ‘You don’t exercise.’
    
    ‘I know, but if I did, I imagine it would be similar. I also don’t love getting in pools, by the way. Sunday nights! Packing for trips! Any transition. Whatever state I’m in I just want to stay in it, if that’s not too much to ask.’ It was, though, for a married person. Sometimes I could hear Harris’s dick whistling impatiently like a teakettle, at higher and higher pitches until I finally couldn’t take it and so I initiated.
    
    I went step by step, demonstrating some movements, saying who put what where, how many times I came, how it ended.
    
    ‘Geez,’ said Jordi. ‘So many positions.’
    
    ‘Yeah, that’s more his thing. I’m completely inside the movie in my head. It’s like I have a screen clamped in front of my face.’
    
    ‘What’s on the screen?’
    
    ‘Oh, you know, I’m a gross stepfather getting a blow job from my nineteen‑year‑old stepdaughter, or I’m the stepdaughter, getting tucked in. Or I’m flipping back and forth between them. There’s a lot of special tucking in involving boners.’
    
    ‘A stepfather and she’s over eighteen,’ Jordi laughed. ‘Very legal.’
    
    ‘It’s consensual! They’re mutually obsessed with each other; that’s a big part of it. You probably just think about Mel.’ ‘You don’t think about Harris?’
    
    ‘No, I do. Same dynamic, but with an intern or assistant. Usually I’m Harris being seduced by her. She’s reassuring me that my wife will never know and finally I just let her suck it.’
    
    ‘Geez, I feel so unimaginative,’ Jordi said. ‘I’m just like, ‘Body feel good. Me want.’’
    
    ‘You’re present – that’s much better! A body‑rooted fucker.’
    
    ‘Is there another kind?’
    
    ‘Mind‑rooted.’ I pointed my thumb at myself. ‘But I’m hoping to be more like you after my trip. Now you go.’
    
    ‘Oh, it’s so boring compared to you guys.’
    
    I was pleased she felt this way.
    
    ‘Just tell me.’
    
    She took a sip of her milkshake and pulled her mountain of black curls into the hair band she always wore around her wrist.
    
    ‘Sometimes it starts when we’re asleep, we just kind of start having sex without even knowing it. So we’re half‑awake and sort of sloppy and then it gets more heated and . . . oh god, it’s not . . . sexy‑sounding like you guys.’
    
    ‘Keep going,’ I said. I was starting to have a bad feeling.
    
    ‘Well, often we’re in a kind of ugly position, like with both our legs wrapped around each other, kind of in this tight ball, and I really like my mouth to be overfilled so almost her whole hand might be in my mouth so there’s drool running down the sides of my face and we’re just, you know, humping, kind of like animals. I’ve actually thought about how ugly this must look, like two desperate cavewomen. Usually we’re too asleep or lazy to go down on each other or use a dick so there’s just, like, a bunch of fingering, or not even that, just grinding. Sometimes I will literally just hump her butt until I come, without even fully waking up. Sometimes I fall asleep with my fingers in her cunt and when I wake up they’re all pruney.’
    
    I was quiet now, bludgeoned by this vision of intimacy. It wasn’t a matter of having lost at this conversation; I had lost at life.
    
    It was almost midnight. Moonlight and lamplight came through the window and her sculptures gleamed around us. They were Jordi’s own body but morphed, ghoulishly skewed toward animals, cars, monsters, always headless, in wood or limestone or plaster. We wouldn’t see each other again before my trip.
    
    ‘You know you can just fly if you want,’ she said. ‘Are you saying that because you think I’ll crash?’
    
    ‘No, no, not at all. Just that if you don’t transform . . . that’s fine, too.’
    
    I stared at her in the half‑light and she looked straight back at me.
    
    ‘I’m just making it harder for myself, aren’t I?’
    
    ‘Maybe.’
    
    I came into the house my usual way, like a thief. I turned the lock slowly and shut the door with the handle all the way to the left to avoid the click of the lock. Took off my shoes. Rolled my feet from heel to toe, which is how ninjas walk so silently. I was often two or three hours late because I had trouble admitting that I was planning to talk to Jordi for five hours. But how could it be any shorter, given that it was my one chance a week to be myself? My heart was pounding as I tiptoed through the living room. I know the quietest way to wash up, too: picking up and putting down the cup and face wash with this technique where you pretend each thing is heavier than it is. Imagine the cup is made of brick, so that as you put it down you’re also lifting it up, resisting its weight – the opposite of this would be just dropping it, letting gravity put it down. When I walk past Harris’s bedroom I think glide, glide, glide.
    
    When Harris comes in late he slams the door cheerfully behind him. He’s trying to be quiet, but not that hard. His mind is on other things, and why not? This is his house. Why behave like a thief? He doesn’t see how each moment can be made terrible if you only try. There can be a problem every second so that life is a sort of low‑grade torture. Then, when you are free, like when I was eating dessert with Jordi, it feels really, really good, like a drug high. So: grit, grit, grit, then: release. Joy. This works especially well for a life built around grueling self‑discipline culminating in glittery debuts and premieres. Grit, grit, grit, then: ta‑da! The thing that links the two states is fantasy. As a girl I fantasized about the perfect dollhouse, now I fantasize about the moment when I would finally reveal what I’d been making in the garage and be suddenly seen, understood, and adored – or at least get to stay in a nice hotel. These rewards really took the edge off life, carried me through the endless cleaning and cooking and caring and working. As a child I knew these weren’t just fantasies. One day I really would leave this house, these people, this city, and live a completely different life."

    "text": "When my eye fell out of its socket, I called for my mother.

    ‘Ma! Ma! What’s happening to me?’ I cried.
    
    She came running into the room from the kitchen, flustered, knife still in hand from chopping onions. ‘What’s wrong?’ she asked. She seemed annoyed that I had interrupted her flow of work. It took her a second to look down at the floor, where my eyeball lay. ‘Oh! Oh God forgive us!’
    
    Ma couldn’t bring herself to touch it; she picked up my eye using two spoons. We weren’t really sure what to do with the eyeball, so we plopped it in the bag of frozen peas she used to make pulao. The entire time I kept one hand over the hole in my face.
    
    We called my father, who was at work. Ma put him on speakerphone so I could explain what had happened.
    
    ‘My eye fell out!’ I said.
    
    My father came home immediately. Ma was in hysterics, pacing back and forth, phoning family and friends and friends of friends who might know what was happening to me.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    The day started off like any other. My father was the first to rise. As usual, he woke the rest of the household with his loud retching over the bathroom sink. Ma got up soon after, heading to the kitchen to heat up leftover daal and cook fresh roti for our breakfast. Sometimes, if I was especially hungry, I asked her for a fried egg. I didn’t that day.
    
    I remembered watching my father that morning as he flagged down a rickshaw and climbed onto it. Off he went to work. After he was gone, I played some songs on the harmonium. Ma was in a good mood and came in to watch me for a bit. She always said my singing calmed her, although I could think of a few instances throughout my life when the sound of my voice had driven her berserk.
    
    It was a few hours later, while I was preparing for the visit of a student, when the eye fell out.
    
    My father took us to the family doctor – a stocky, talkative man we had been visiting ever since I was twelve. I think he was related to my father through some long-winded connection. A cousin of a cousin, maybe. I couldn’t be sure. I watched the two men discuss my condition, occasionally dropping in some personal anecdote or news about the extended family, but otherwise they stayed mainly on course. Ma had brought along my eye in the pea bag, which was now dripping condensation on the floor.
    
    ‘I know exactly why this is happening!’ exclaimed the doctor. ‘You must take her to the marriage market!’
    
    All attention shifted to me.
    
    ‘The market?’ Ma replied, hand over her mouth. ‘But –’
    
    ‘You’re an expiring woman,’ said the doctor, pointing at me. ‘This happens to women of a certain age, you know, to the ones that put off getting married for work or school or whatever various reasons . . .’ He trailed off and looked at my father. ‘She’s in rot now. You’ll have to take her to the market before it’s too late.’
    
    ‘How much time do we have?’ my father replied.
    
    ‘How much time do you want?’ said the doctor. ‘Thirty-four years old! Not young anymore, eh? I don’t think there’s much time at all!’
    
    ‘And the eye?’ I asked. ‘Can you put it back?’
    
    ‘I am sorry,’ replied the doctor. ‘But no, I cannot.’
    
    The doctor gave me an eyepatch to wear and instructed me to keep the area clean. My father was quite silent in the taxi home. I asked Ma to let me sit on the left side of the car, so that I could look out the window through my one remaining eye.
    
    ‘Say something!’ my mother exclaimed. ‘Your daughter is falling apart!’
    
    My father grunted. ‘You heard what the doctor said. She is not young anymore. Perhaps we waited too long. We should have started looking a long time ago.’
    
    ‘We can start looking now.’
    
    ‘No, no one will take a one-eyed woman. We must go to the marriage market, like the doctor said.’
    
     
    
     
    
    That night Ma slept next to me, just in case something else happened. Restless, I kept turning towards her. In the glow of the air conditioner lights, I could see her rough outline, even with one eye. She was on her back and didn’t turn towards me.
    
    It was so cold that night. Somehow I was simultaneously shivering and sweating. Even with the wintertime duvet I felt a chill penetrating deep into my bones. Ma seemed to be awake too.
    
    ‘Ma, what will happen to me now?’
    
    She held my hand. ‘Don’t worry so much. Your father took the day off work tomorrow. In the morning, we will figure out what to do.’
    
    ‘Will you really take me to the market?’
    
    ‘I don’t know.’
    
    ‘Will I still be able to play the harmonium?’
    
    Ma sighed. ‘I don’t know.’
    
     
    
     
    
    When I woke in the morning, I peeled off my blanket to find that one of my legs had shrivelled up and turned black, detaching from the rest of my body just below the knee. Looking at it, I felt a strange mixture of disgust and wonder, the former because it was a ghastly sight overall, and the latter because I was amazed at my body’s capacity for self-destruction.
    
    I thought of the house geckos in our flat. Once, some twenty-odd years ago, Ma had thrown a book at one on the wall of our living room, cutting off its tail. Ha! I finally got it! she said, rejoicing in her victory. Three weeks later, I noticed the same gecko loitering on our flat walls once again, its stubby, regrowing tail sprouting from its tiny body. I wondered if my leg would come back that way.
    
    When my parents saw my dead, gangrenous leg, the severity of my situation must have dawned on them. My father skipped breakfast – unusual for him, as he was generally a hungry man – to schedule a house call from our family doctor. Ma phoned my grandmother, who arrived an hour later with freshly-made samosas.
    
    ‘Oh, you poor thing!’ said my grandmother, sitting next to me on the bed. ‘Look at the state of you!’
    
    ‘Hi, Nani. How are you?’
    
    ‘Oh, who will marry you now?’ she cried. She glared at my mother. ‘This is all your doing!’
    
    Ma looked down at her feet. I grabbed a samosa from the paper bag Nani had brought with her. It was my favourite kind: filled with ground beef and perfectly crispy on the outside.
    
    ‘Amma, we didn’t know –’
    
    ‘Don’t “Amma” me! I told you how this happened to my brother-in-law’s daughter! He waited too long, encouraged her to study and work instead of settling down –’
    
    ‘Amma, how was I –’
    
    ‘– and she rotted! Expired, just like your daughter will now! You modern women, with your modern ideals. Well, look at where it’s gotten you. A one-eyed, one-legged woman no one will marry!’
    
    I failed to see what was so modern about studying and working. The men in my life had been doing these things for decades, and many of them were very old-fashioned. I kept silent and chewed. I was very tired. Besides, despite being present, this entire conversation between mother and daughter seemed to be going on entirely in my absence. I felt I had very little to do with it.
    
    ‘She had dreams!’ Ma yelled. ‘She was an excellent harmonium player. Still is!’ She shook with emotion. ‘She’s good, she’s on TV, she’s on the radio, she makes a significant amount of money from her lessons. People are desperate to have her teach their kids, did you know that? All because I gave her that freedom, I put her in harmonium classes, I took her there every weekend! Not even her father helped . . .’
    
    My father entered then. ‘Amma, thank you for visiting,’ he said. ‘If you ladies are done arguing, the family doctor is on his way.’ His gaze shifted in my general direction. I noticed he couldn’t quite look me in the eye. ‘Tomorrow we are taking her to the market.’
    
    The family doctor was about an hour late. He always made us wait when we visited him at the hospital too, so this didn’t surprise me. He looked at me with an expression of pity that was simultaneously full of smugness, as though he very badly wanted to say I told you so but couldn’t. It would have been very cruel of him to do so. The doctor fitted me with a prosthetic, prescribed me some medicine and told my parents there could be no more delay. They had to take me to the marriage market immediately, or my rapid decay would result in death, probably within the next two days. Ma and Nani let out cries of pain and panic, while my father nodded stoically. I was just happy to be able to walk again, even if I did stumble here and there.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    The following morning (fortunately, no other body parts had fallen off), Ma and my father were to take me to the marriage market. There was a certain degree of preparation required beforehand. With the help of the prosthetic leg, I was able to take myself to the bathroom to bathe. I took off my eyepatch and ran lukewarm water over my face, washing off the grime of the past two days. Once I was clean, Ma dried and styled my hair, applied heavy makeup on my face and dressed me in her finest sari. My father bought a fresh eyepatch from the pharmacy for me to wear.
    
    The marriage market, as suggested by its name, was a gathering place where the city’s single women put themselves on display for eligible bachelors. It was located at a convention centre. Women were priced, then assigned booths on the large, sprawling floor, where men were floated freely around, conversing, and ultimately choosing their spouses. Marriages occurred on-site, and most of the men who went in alone came out with a wife of their choosing. Most people – whether that was a woman on display or a man casually browsing – were accompanied to the market by their families, who helped vet, barter, and choose the best mate for their children.
    
    I had heard stories of the marriage market from friends and family, but these tales had always carried an element of detachment. I would never have imagined that I would become one of the market’s offerings. I suppose I was somewhat naive, in a sense, thinking I had more time.
    
    After we arrived, my parents and I stood in line for a booth assignment. I looked around and observed – as well as I could with my one remaining eye – the hordes of women that had come to take part in this grand exchange. They were of all ages – fresh-faced, newly-adult women, middle-aged women, older women, and even the geriatric. I also noticed a few expiring women, just like me, wearing eyepatches or wigs to conceal balding heads, or using crutches.
    
    Once we were at the front of the line, the ticketing attendant took one look at me and asked, ‘Expiring?’
    
    ‘Yes,’ said my father. ‘But it is still early, and slow. She is a very good harmonium player. You might see her on the television sometimes.’
    
    ‘And age?’
    
    ‘Thirty-four. But looks younger, doesn’t she?’
    
    The attendant, a young boy, no older than somewhere in the mid-twenties, said, ‘She’ll need a discount sticker.’ He reached for a bright orange sticker on his desk and peeled it off its backing, stood up and reached over to stick it on my forehead.
    
    ‘What does it say?’ I asked my father.
    
    ‘Discounted.’
    
     
    
     
    
    We went in. I was sure my parents had determined a suitable price for me, but I didn’t care to find out how much that was. I felt my value was diminishing, anyways, with the discount sticker and my missing eye and leg. Not that they were exactly missing. I knew exactly where they were (the eye was still in the pea bag, now back in the freezer, and the leg – well, my father had simply thrown it in the rubbish bin).
    
    Ma set up the booth with photographs of me throughout the years. She also put out business cards. My father arranged a few pamphlets containing my biodata –information about my schooling, work experience, and musical achievements. I didn’t remember ever making one, so it must have been my parents’ own creation, a carefully-constructed document of my identity as it existed in their eyes. Ma positioned me at the front of the booth, shifting my limbs and adjusting my sari – the way a shopkeeper would a mannequin’s – to maximise my appeal to potential suitors.
    
    As I stood there, watching one man after another walk past my booth, take one look at my eyepatch and quickly scurry away, I thought about what my life might look like after the market. Would I still have the freedom to sing and play the harmonium, the way I did while living with my parents? I suspected life as I knew it would be over, that my craft would have to take a backseat as I became one half of a whole, a wife to a husband, a mother to a child that would take root in my broken body. Suddenly I was overcome with emotion, a profound sadness I hadn’t let myself experience until right then. Also my legs – especially the one with the prosthetic – hurt from standing so long, and it was very hot inside the convention centre. I wept.
    
    ‘Don’t cry!’ warned my father. ‘You’ll scare off the potential suitors.’
    
    Ma gently – and silently – wiped away my tears.
    
    The first man to speak to my parents was a doctor-in-training. He was thirty years old and had been married once before. He said his first wife had passed away from natural causes, though it was unclear what these causes were.
    
    ‘Oh, may her soul rest in peace. When did she pass away?’ asked Ma.
    
    ‘Last week,’ replied the man.
    
    The second man must have been older than my father. He certainly had more grey hairs than my father did. He looked at me briefly, read my biodata intently, and spent an oddly-long amount of time going over photographs of me as a teenager. He was a businessman and spent much of the year travelling.
    
    ‘What kind of business?’ asked my father.
    
    ‘Oh, you know the kind. Shipping and trading.’
    
    My father really did not know the kind.
    
    The third man was the only one to address me directly. I think he recognized me from my brief stints on television, which came about when a few channels asked me to perform on one of their nationally-broadcast music shows. I’d made good money like this, and used my earnings to buy my parents gifts, or finance road trips with friends.
    
    ‘Discounted, huh?’ asked the third man. ‘Ridiculous! Do they know what a star they have here?’
    
    My father seemed to melt at this comment. ‘That’s what I told them! She’s a musical genius.’
    
    ‘Half a star now,’ I replied.
    
    The third man looked at me. His gaze was intense and full of curiosity. ‘Time caught up to you?’ he asked.
    
    I shrugged. ‘I barely saw it coming.’
    
    ‘Yes, well, I suppose you wouldn’t, not with one eye.’
    
    I laughed then. Really laughed. I appreciated someone approaching my situation with humour, although it did all still feel hopeless overall. I looked closer at the third man. He had a nice face, and a smile that was slightly off-kilter, but endearing regardless. He had the look of someone who knew something you didn’t.
    
    The third man bought me that evening. The formalities were quick and uncomplicated. There was an uttering of words, a signing of papers, and a commitment to be with one another till death did us part. My parents hugged me goodbye as I prepared to go to my new home. By the end of the night, I felt generally optimistic about life with the third man. Or, as he was now, my husband.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    There was kindness in the beginning. I like to remember it that way.
    
    But marital life required some adjustment. I came to realise how much I had taken for granted throughout the years – having both eyes, legs, and the freedom that came with being an unmarried, childless woman. The truth was I was very comfortable at my parents’ home; it had never really occurred to me that said comfort was at the expense of Ma’s constant labour. More importantly, I had been very free. If, for instance, I wanted to see a friend for poori and tea in the middle of the day, I could. If I wished to watch a late-night artist showcase across the city, my father (albeit begrudgingly) would accompany me. I’d stay up till the early hours of the morning watching natoks on television or playing songs on my harmonium, and no one could tell me anything. I had a solid circle of friends whom I could count on for a good time. My life had belonged entirely to me; I had been a bird in an unlocked cage.
    
    Now that I was on the other side of things – a wife to a man – life became very different, and I felt like I was always running out of time.
    
    My husband was a university professor. I liked to think we had that in common, that we had both taken on educating roles in life. However, my husband taught mathematics, and as a result (or perhaps due to the fact that he was naturally drawn to mathematics), he was very formulaic in his thinking. Very exact. He wanted for us both to wake together, and for meals to be served at certain set times. He wanted the house spotless at all times, and demanded quiet when he needed to grade papers or take a nap after a long day of teaching. I failed to understand how he could live life by such rigid rules, but I soon learned that it wasn’t for me to understand at all.
    
    I say there was kindness because my husband gave me grace, even if it was only during the initial months when I was still getting accustomed to life as his wife. He taught me certain things, like how to cook his favourite foods, wash his clothes, and how to behave when he climbed on top of me at night. He even let me play my harmonium – which my parents had dropped off along with the rest of my things – whenever I wished. In fact, he enjoyed it when I did. It was one of the reasons he had married me. When I sang, my husband would shower me with praises, telling me I had the voice of an angel. Those early days were nice, in a sense, but I wouldn’t call what laid between us love. Something resembling it, sure.
    
    About half a year into our marriage, some of my students’ parents reached out to me about resuming my harmonium lessons. I ran the idea by my husband.
    
    ‘I deal with enough overgrown children at the university,’ he said. ‘I don’t need more in my house. Unless you want to have one of our own.’
    
    I ignored the suggestion. ‘I could go to them,’ I counter-offered. ‘That’s what I used to do back in the day.’
    
    ‘With your one leg?’ he retorted.
    
    I never mentioned the idea again. I couldn’t bear the thought of my students being around someone as unwelcoming as him. What he said was true. I was a half-woman, with my one leg and missing eye. But my husband had known both these things before he chose to buy me at the marriage market. What good did it do him to taunt me now? I began wondering why my husband had purchased a discounted woman like me in the first place. He was relatively young (a man’s thirty-five was very different to a woman’s thirty-five), good-looking, and he had a stable job. His family, when I met them, seemed polite and welcoming enough. Why didn’t he leave a half-woman like me to the half-men (who weren’t called half-men at all, but just men)? Sometimes I thought he liked that I was wounded – that having my shortcomings so prevalent made him feel better about his own.
    
    It was around the eight-month mark that I became a whole woman again. One morning I woke to find that my right eye was back, as good as new. I think the new eye had even better vision than the old one. My leg, too, grew back with haste, just like the gecko’s tail from my childhood flat. It was an odd feeling, to have a functioning eye and leg after spending so long without them. It felt like a rebirth. And a death of sorts too.
    
    My parents were overjoyed; they came over with sweets – rasgulla and sandesh, my favourites – to celebrate the occasion. ‘I knew it!’ boasted my father. ‘I knew your husband was a good match as soon as I saw him at the marriage market! Look at you, my daughter, whole again!’
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    My husband was kind, and then he was not. With men, it is always the same story.
    
    My harmonium, which my husband had encouraged me to play, save for when he needed to sleep, became of utmost annoyance to him. ‘Keep it down, I’m grading papers!’ he’d say, or a simple, ‘Be quiet!’ If he had doted on me at first, any semblance of fondness was gone by the time we reached one-and-a-half years of marriage. The change was gradual, but it did not go unnoticed. My husband became short-tempered. He began to spend more time at the university, often staying out late with friends or colleagues. I grew suspicious, but never jealous. In a way, I felt like this man, this stranger I had married to save myself from the clutches of my body’s expiration, had always only ever been a stranger. He had never belonged to me, nor I to him. I knew that he kept a part of himself stored away in a secret place, a place that was forever out of my reach.
    
    Once, in the dark, I asked my husband whether there was somebody else. I told him I wouldn’t be angry, and that I was only curious.
    
    ‘No,’ he said. There was just enough hesitation in his tone to let me know I wasn’t being paranoid. ‘You’re being paranoid.’
    
    ‘Am I?’
    
    ‘Yes, you women are always overthinking. Now sleep.’
    
     
    
     
    
    I imagined our marriage as an egg: flawless and smooth at first, until gradually, cracks began to appear. Who caused them, I didn’t know. I imagined the yolk of it – my husband’s secrets, my resentment towards him, our general unhappiness – oozing out of the cracks on the shell. A rotten egg, that’s what we were.
    
    Ma came over frequently, especially towards the end. I think she could sense that I was preparing for departure. During one of her visits I lay my head down on her lap. She ran a hand through my hair and hummed one of my favourite songs. My husband was at work.
    
    ‘Ma, I’m going to leave him.’
    
    Ma’s hand froze. ‘Leave?’
    
    ‘Yes.’
    
    ‘And go where?’
    
    ‘Back to you and my father,’ I said. ‘Won’t you have me?’
    
    ‘You’ll die,’ she said, voice quaking. ‘The rot will come back.’
    
    ‘I’ll take it, Ma.’ My face felt warm, then tears.
    
    ‘Oh, what would people say?’ cried my mother. ‘A woman of your age, if you separate from him . . . No.’ Her tone turned stern, the way it used to sound sometimes when I was a child, and refused to study. ‘This is just what marriage is,’ she went on. ‘It’s new to you, so you don’t know how it is –’
    
    ‘I don’t need to know how it is anymore.’
    
    ‘You became too used to your free-bird life, your adventurous ways . . . Always running around the city, spending time out with God-knows-who! Your father and I allowed some of it, I admit, letting you go to those concerts and make those television appearances, oh and the radio –’
    
    ‘That made me happy, Ma,’ I cried. ‘I was so happy then.’
    
    ‘When your father and I first married, I cried every night for a month. But slowly, I came to accept my situation. Soon, with time, you will do the same.’
    
    I had always thought my parents were a happy couple. It occurred to me that there was much that Ma never told me. ‘I don’t want to do the same!’ I howled. ‘I had a good life before him. I don’t see why anything had to change!’
    
    ‘You were fading away! You were becoming half a woman!’
    
    My tears streamed down and onto Ma’s sari. ‘I’d rather have death than this kind of life.’
    
    Ma kept silent. She no longer hummed. She resumed running her hand through my hair, which felt very comfortable. Except for when her fingers caught in the tangles.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    As it turned out I didn’t have to leave my husband at all. I was preparing dinner one evening, months after Ma’s visit, when he entered our home with a woman in tow. She was young. I would’ve guessed she was in her mid-twenties, at best.
    
    ‘Who is this?’ I asked him. ‘Hello,’ I said to her.
    
    ‘I’ve married again,’ said my husband. ‘I went to the marriage market and picked her up today.’
    
    ‘What?’
    
    I had a strange experience then. As I looked at my husband, then at his new wife, then back at my husband, I left my own body and entered the woman’s. I was watching this ridiculous scenario through her eyes. What must she have thought of me, in that moment, wearing my raggedy, fraying nightgown and brandishing the wooden spoon I was using to stir the pot of daal on the stove? More importantly, what did she see in him, this man that had disappointed me in so many ways, and (though she didn’t know it) would soon do the same to her? To her, I must have seemed like the only obstacle between her and the picturesque marital life of her dreams. An angry, scorned first wife.
    
    It was a tragic situation, but slightly comical.
    
    ‘It is time for you to leave,’ continued my husband. ‘I have brought divorce papers –’
    
    ‘All right,’ I said.
    
    ‘All right?’ he asked.
    
    I realised my husband expected some resistance here, that perhaps I had been assigned the role of desperate wife – which I had no idea how to play. The truth was I felt no desire to stay in this home with a man who had only ever used me to alleviate the loneliness of his life. Half or whole, I decided then that I would face whatever fate lay ahead of me, whether that was a slow demise through further limb loss, or a quick, painless death as I once again became an expiring woman.
    
    I signed the papers right there at my husband’s dining table, grateful to still have two working arms. I can’t say I felt much in the moment except for relief – a sense of weightlessness that I hadn’t experienced in many, many months. As I watched my (now ex) husband embrace his new, fresh-faced wife, I felt no anger or resentment. I only thought of what lay ahead of me.
    
    ‘You’ll die,’ said my ex-husband as I left. ‘You’ll die without me.’
    
     
    
    That night, back at my parents’ flat, the atmosphere was one of overwhelming happiness and monstrous tragedy. We did not know how much time I had left, or what I would lose next. There was little scientific evidence as to how fading-away worked, and most women cured it by marrying. Well, we had tried that. I played the harmonium late into the night, as much as I wished, filling up our flat with the sounds of my sa-re-ga-mas.
    
    Ma slept next to me, just like she did the night I lost my eye so many months ago, and like she often did when I was a child.
    
    ‘I’m sorry,’ she whispered to me, just before I entered the world of dreams. ‘We should have looked into other ways to save you.’
    
    ‘It’s okay, Ma,’ I murmured. ‘You did what you could. It was all you knew.’
    
    The next morning, and for the rest of my life, I stood on two legs, and looked at the world through fresh eyes."

    "text": "When they start the announcements to say the plane is landing, thank you for flying with us, put your seatbelt on and don’t be wandering about, trying to use the toilet, all the rest of it, I press my forehead against the window.

    A cloud stretches across the sky. Bright white like hotel sheets. Unbroken, so I can’t see anything below. The airport. Or where the sea turns into the Lagan. Farmhouses and their neat green fields. Wild patches of forest. The navy ikea warehouse. The mountains. My da, recovering from his operation.
    
    When he called on Tuesday evening, drunk, and asked me back, the first thought I had was about the woman he’d been seeing. I vaguely knew she was younger and they’d met in a pub. I asked could she not help and he paused. Then he said he thought she’d moved back to Lisburn. I said had she moved back or did he think she had. He said he didn’t know.
    
    No. I said. You can’t not know. She’s either living with you or she’s not. 
    
    Right. He said. Right. Yes. No. No she’s not.
    
    I could have hung up the phone then and there. It wasn’t as if it had a whole lot to do with me, really. And it wasn’t even clear what he was asking me for. To come back and stay for a few weeks. To do what? I’m no nurse. And he’s hardly bedbound, taking his food through a straw.
    
    I wondered if there was someone else I could get in the mix. We could share, or ideally they could go instead of me. If not that woman he had on the go, maybe my sister? My mum? Ha! I raised my eyebrows there, just thinking about that one. Not a chance.
    
    Right, how long would you be needing me back? I said. It might be tricky, with work. You know. Silence. Then he said if I could come in the next few days and stay over the coming weekend, maybe the one after too, he would appreciate it. I’d be grateful, son. He said. My lips stretched into a line. Two weeks he’s wanting. Two weeks?
    
    Right. I said. Right. But then I remembered the Saturday I had coming up. Kimberly’s school friend Sophia’s wedding, at a big country house in Buckinghamshire. All Kimberly’s school girlies drunk on prosecco, drinking from three in the afternoon, competitively not eating anything. There’d be tears from one of them at some point, quite possibly Kimberly. And no free bar, so I’d have to buy rounds of cocktails and shots and God knows what to keep up with the other boyfriends and husbands. When I’d asked would there be a free bar, months ago, Kimberly called me cheap and then selfish, and then we were arguing and she was crying and locking herself in the toilet. Later she shook her head while she said I had no ambition in the voice I hear her use on work video calls. It was one of those arguments where it becomes about every argument you’ve ever had, or wanted to have, but held back.
    
    Compared to all that, how bad could my da’s really be? I could head down over the weekend, go out for a few drinks with the boys, see if Ciara’s about, help him tidy up, take my work laptop to a cafe during the week, back on the Friday. Worst case the Sunday. No bother.
    
    Right, you know what. I said to my da. I think work will be fine with it. I’ll say it’s an emergency or whatever. I’ll book a flight for Friday evening then, or Saturday morning.
    
    Thank you, son. He said.
    
    But now it’s Saturday, late morning, and I’m walking through the airport, past the Tayto welcome sign and out to the taxi bay, and I’m getting these texts from him, every few minutes, saying he’ll collect me, then that he can’t because there’s a problem with the car, then that he’ll order a taxi, and next is he can’t order one but if I order he’ll pay, and I’m in the mind to block his number and book on the next flight back.
    
    I stand blinking in the sun, my T-shirt sticking to my back, faffing around with the taxi app.
    
    When we pull into his street he’s standing in the doorway, waving. He looks small and his hair is grey. He hasn’t lost his looks though, he has a kind of chiselled thing going on. He doesn’t look infirm; I can’t see any crutches.
    
    Right son. He says, as I walk around to the boot of the taxi for my bag. Need a hand there, do you?
    
    He’s smiling but I can see panic in his eyes. He always seems mystified as to how to behave around me, as if being a parent has never stopped feeling surreal to him. The way I imagine an amputee might be about their circumstances. He seems frightened of me, almost. I suppose it’s not ideal for him, having me to stay for the first time in God knows how long when he’s in this state. I nod and smile, trying to force happy eyes.
    
    He pinches a lock of my hair. You’ve grown your hair. He says.
    
    Right. I say. Right. Yes. Thank you. Will we go inside then?
    
    In his living room the full extent of the problem hits me. Plates and cups piled under his coffee table. Beer cans and wine bottles. Plastic bags everywhere. I can see a pair of trousers slung over the back of his sofa. And the smell of the place, like sour milk and old wine. Jesus Christ.
    
    Right. I say. I’ll put my bag down here, will I? I set it down on the coffee table, the one surface in the room free of debris. Right, I need the bathroom here.
    
    The bath is full of clothes. A toilet roll has unravelled across the floor and the bin is on its side.
    
    Dad. I shout from upstairs. Why are the clothes in the bath?
    
    I walk out onto the landing and shout again. He comes and stands at the bottom of the stairs.
    
    Why are they in the bath? I say. The shirts and trousers?
    
    Right. He says. Yes. Yes, they’ve just come out of the wash. They were drying on the radiators.
    
    And then? He doesn’t answer. Did you take them off the radiators and put them in the bath? I say. He walks back into the living room.
    
    The kitchen looks like a bomb’s hit it. More dishes and plastic bags. Three bin bags tied up by the backdoor with flattened cardboard boxes stacked beside them. I open the fridge and there are empty takeaway boxes filling the shelves. I find tomatoes spotted with fur, onions sprouting long fingers and a tube of green slime. The remains of an ancient cucumber.
    
    I’m throwing out these old vegetables. I shout over my shoulder. They’re absolutely stinkin’ dad. Disgusting.
    
    He says something but I can’t hear what.
    
    They’ve all turned colours they shouldn’t be. I hear him on the stairs and then opening and closing doors upstairs.
    
    I’m going out to buy things. I’m telling myself as much as him. Equipment. Bleach and things. 
    
    Out in the street I look back at his two-storey red brick terrace. I can’t see him in the upstairs bedroom but it’s possible he’s in there, standing back from the window. I wave, just in case, and walk round the corner before I take my phone out.
    
    I click through to my mum’s number. I could call, but what to say? She has her new life now, her new husband who’s a doctor, and fair play.
    
    And if this new life goes wrong she’ll claw her way to another one. Probably an even better one, knowing her. If she lost her job tomorrow she’d have another lined up the same afternoon. And if she couldn’t find one she’d be out sweeping the streets. She grew up on the Bogside and ended up working as an HR manager at KPMG. She knows you have to keep going forward no matter what. I mean everybody sort of knows that, but she really knows it.
    
    Your da is the sort of man you give one chance. She used to say, during their divorce years. It doesn’t work, you cut your losses. Get out as quick as you can. 
    
    She was too tough for him. He underestimated that. I suppose there were a lot of things I didn’t understand about her either, and probably still don’t. I never even thought about the way she would carry on, the way she would talk, until long after I stopped living with her. If you’re ever in a situation where someone is shooting at you, where you’re being shot at, don’t run. Get down on the ground and lie flat. Don’t try to run. That was one she used to say all the time, on the walk to school, if she was taking us instead of the childminder. Now can you walk that last bit by yourselves or I’ll miss the start of my meeting?
    
    When he had his affair he thought he could scrape back into her good books. No chance. She changed the locks the same day. He came back and was banging on the door. She stood in the window and phoned his mobile. Fuck. Off. She said, when he answered. And I really, truly, mean that. I mean it. 
    
    I thought she might have been calling his bluff but the day with the chicken I knew it was real. She was never one for making dinners but during that whole business she had me and Maureen sitting at the table in the evening, eating our Dunnes Stores microwave lasagnes on plates with a salad. On the Sunday, she announced we would be having Sunday lunch. I looked at Maureen and she was staring straight ahead, frowning. My mum had bought a rotisserie chicken and coleslaw and there were oven chips and steamed frozen vegetables in dishes.
    
    Help yourselves to vegetables and I’ll serve the chicken! She declared, when we were seated.
    
    That was when I saw him, carefully pushing down on the handle of the glass door to the conservatory at the bottom of the kitchen. He would have come down the alley with the bins and then climbed over the fence and crept up through the garden. His body was pressed against the glass.
    
    I said nothing but she would have seen the look on my face. She spun around. Out! She shouted. Get out!
    
    He was already in the kitchen, approaching the table, holding his hands up in the air. I made a mistake. He said. Grainnie. I made a mistake.
    
    Out! She shouted. You will not ruin this lunch. No. 
    
    Thirteen years. He said. Grainnie. Thirteen years.
    
    She stepped forward and picked up the plate holding the rotisserie chicken. He grabbed it too. I never knew why he did that. He panicked, I suppose. She pulled it back towards her and the force of the two of them tugging sent the chicken flying into the air. It landed on the kitchen tiles with a sound like a smacked bottom. I couldn’t believe it had happened, but there it was, on its back on the floor. She looked like she would kill him.
    
    They’re my children too! His voice cracked. He’s my son. Grainnie, he’s my son!
    
    Stay where you are. She said, holding her hands up beside her head. Nobody move. I’ll stick it under the tap.
    
    That seemed like the opportune moment for me and Maureen to skulk off for pizza and the computer. I looked at her. She nodded and we slid out of our chairs. They were so busy shouting their lungs out they didn’t notice. They’ve barely been in the same room since.
    
    I look down at my mum’s number again. I hold my finger above the call button and then put the phone back into my pocket.
    
    In the Spar I stand in front of the cleaning products, weighing up my options. I choose bleach and blue cloths. What else? Sponges. There’s window cleaner, but that’s the least of his problems. Bin bags. Another bleach. Green surface cleaner spray? The label says it can be used on any surface. Right, let’s get that too. I grab beers, orange juice, eggs, bread and butter on my way to the tills. At the checkout I buy him a Galaxy bar.
    
    Back at the house he’s nowhere to be seen. Dad. I shout. I’m back with the shopping.
    
    I set my bags down on the kitchen table. Dad?
    
    My phone vibrates. A text from my da: Might have a lie down here son. 
    
    I laugh. Fair play to him. I reply: No bother :). I’ll clear up
    
    I start in the front room. At first I’m sorting tins from plastic for recycling but by the middle of the first bag I’ve given up. I just chuck everything in together. Plastic cutlery. Tins. Wine bottles. The old bits of toast I find wedged down the side of the sofa. The only saving grace is the size of the place puts a limit on the mess.
    
    On my third bin bag I check my phone. No more messages from my da.
    
    One from Kimberly: Missing you! And a picture. A selfie of her in her wedding outfit.
    
    I type a reply: Sooo hot. Delete it. I look at my emoji options. The flame? Not quite right. I type Sooo hot again. Stick with that. I add: How’s the wedding?
    
    She replies instantly: Yes! Fun!!
    
    Very shrill.
    
    Another Kimberly message: Emma-Kate and Harry engaged too now!!! Last week! They waited to tell everyone in person 
    
    Oh Jesus. Another of the school girlies engaged. More pressure there. More evenings where we have to have dinners as couples and Kimberly goes to the bathroom and the girlies ask me why I haven’t proposed yet. They’ll say she wants a special location. Edinburgh Castle is the latest. A place we’ve never been. They’ll go on and on about it, plastered. Why can nobody ask me for anything when they’re sober?
    
    I reply: Omg. Class! Tell them congratulations from me 
    
    She replies: I will!! 
    
    Another message: How is your dad?
    
    I type: Jesus it’s bad. Delete it.
    
    Where would you even start with explaining him to Kimberly? She’s never met him. She’s met my mum. And then our mums met once, in London. It was like watching a cheetah and a flamingo sitting at the table having dinner. Kimberly’s mum Sara is thin and always wearing grey. Well, both the mums are thin. For different reasons, and different kinds of thin. They’re both blonde too, but different blondes. My mum’s would be more yellow. She was wearing a leopard print dress and red high heels. Kimberly’s mum asked mine what she’d done earlier. My mum said she’d gone to a museum. She said the name of an artist whose exhibition had been on. Sara pronounced the name back to her in a French accent. Well, that was it. My mum asked her what she did for work. I looked at her. She knew fine rightly Sara had always been a housewife. Sara said that Kimberly’s father had been an investment banker before he retired. And yourself? Said my mum, topping up her wine glass. It was all downhill from there. I said to Kimberly after, about them being like a cheetah and a flamingo, and she asked which one was the cheetah. I just looked at her. Well I thought it was a lovely evening. She said.
    
    I type: He’s grand like. Just needs a hand tidying up. He’s resting now
    
    I close that chat and open the one with Liam. I type: What time tonight then? I’m around from whenever
    
    I can see he is typing. I’m easy. 7? 8? Will we grab dinner before or what? 
    
    I reply: I reckon I’ll eat with my da. 8?
    
    Sweet! He replies.
    
    I open my chat with Ciara. I type: Short notice, but I’m around this weekend. Are you about? 
    
    I can see she has read it. My face feels hot. I put my phone down and pick it up again.
    
    She replies: Hello, well this is a surprise
    
    Another message: A nice one, I mean. Of course!
    
    I catch myself in the mirror, smiling down at the phone.
    
    Another message: I have a birthday I can’t get out of this evening, but shouldn’t be a late one. Or tomorrow, depending when you fly back? How come you’re back anyway?
    
    Ok sweet, I’ll be about tonight. I’ll give you a message later. If not will we say tomorrow?
    
    And it’s my da, he’d an operation. I’m helping out for a bit 
    
    Sorry to hear that. Is he alright? 
    
    Aye long story, I’ll tell you in person
    
    Ok sweet. Let’s keep in touch this evening then? 
    
    I type: Yes! For sure I look through my emojis. Beaming smile? Too matey. Too . . .  asexual. The heart eyes? Too far the other way. Would the sunglasses be funny? What would be the joke? Right, no emojis.
    
    I send: Speak soon xx
    
    I can see a message from Kimberly. I ignore it and start on the kitchen. The vegetable crisper is worse than it appeared on first inspection. Papery garlic skins plastered over the bottom. I manoeuvre it out of the fridge. But how would you clean it? I fill it with water from the kettle and stick bleach in. The acid lemon smell fills the kitchen. I leave it to sit while I take the bin bags out.
    
    His majesty surfaces when the worst is over.
    
    Right. Have you thoughts on dinner? He says, standing in the kitchen doorway. There’s a wee Indian place on the next street. Tandoori Dream it’s called.
    
    Right. Hello. I say. Yes. I’ll eat anything. 
    
    I set the table with plates and cutlery when the food arrives. He heaps white rice and beef curry onto his plate.
    
    That’s beautiful. He says, before he starts eating. For some reason this annoys me. That smells gorgeous. 
    
    Yes. Nothing beats a curry. I say. So did you sleep ok earlier?
    
    Right. Yes. He says. So have you been to any gigs lately? What bands are you listening to? 
    
    He’s said nothing about how tidy the place is. I start to wonder if sitting in front of the TV and sticking some rubbish on wouldn’t have been better.
    
    Are you still cooking? I say.
    
    That beef is beautiful. He says.
    
    You were into your cooking there for a while? I say.
    
    Right. Yes. He says. Yes. Any good shows you’re watching? 
    
    Right. I say. Ok. None come to mind. I was thinking to go out after dinner. I’ll get some pints in with Liam and some people. 
    
    Right. He says. Yes. Get the drinks in with the boys. Good man.
    
    I stick my head into the living room to give him his Galaxy bar before I leave. I got that for your dessert. I say. He’s watching TV with a bottled beer. I toss it at him. He surprises me by catching it.
    
    I check my phone after I fix my hair in the hall mirror.
    
    Messages from Kimberly: Miss you!!!
    
    Pictures of the wedding, a card with Kimberly written in swirly writing, the couple cutting the cake, a group photo of the school girlies, another selfie.
    
    I reply: Apologies, busy with my dad. Gorgeous! Looks like a class day
    
    I stick my phone back in my pocket before any other messages come through.
    
    At the pub I text Liam while I wait for the second serving of my Guinness: Where yous at?
    
    I find him at the pool table, with Rory and Conor. The sight of Rory makes me wince. His hair. No amount of combing it this or that way can take the bad look off it at this stage. He’d be better off hacking it all off. You can see too, under his jacket, that he’s gone the shape of a dessert spoon. He’s a curved back and stomach. Jesus, the sight of him makes me feel about a hundred. Conor and Liam are still in good nick, at least.
    
    Liam waves me over. Alright man. He says. He slaps my back and grasps me into a half hug. Great to see you. I repeat the gesture with Rory and Conor.
    
    Looking well. Says Rory. Looking very well. 
    
    And yourself, big lad. I say, as we sit down in a booth. And yourself. I notice their Guinnesses are only a few inches down; we’re not out a round.
    
    Right so. Says Liam. Conor is just telling us about the new girl he has on the go. Conor’s beaming.
    
    Oh aye? I say.
    
    Twenty-three. He nods, he holds his left hand up, to make the numbers with his fingers. Two. Three.
    
    What happened there with your woman? I say.
    
    Oh that’s over. All over. He says, shaking his head. Long story. Long story.
    
    Well, twenty-three, cheers to that. I say. Yes. Twenty-three is the perfect age. 
    
    Liam laughs. The perfect age, is it? Why’s that? Conor is still beaming. Rory has a dreamy look on his face.
    
    Twenty-three-year-old boys still don’t really know how to fuck. I say. She’ll think you’re God’s gift. But you can have some kind of conversation with her. It’s not like she’s still in school. But then, at the same time, you’d sound wise. 
    
    Don’t talk nonsense. Says Liam, laughing. Twenty-three-year-old boys don’t know how to fuck. He scoffs. Yes they do. Catch yourself on. 
    
    Obviously they can. I say. Technically they CAN. But they haven’t a clue what they’re doing. I hadn’t a clue. Liam shakes his head, lifts his Guinness to his lips. You hadn’t either! I say. Admit it to yourself.
    
    He’s right. Says Conor, laughing. Think about it and he’s right. You’d have had to have had a girlfriend a fair while. 
    
    Exactly. I say. So now Conor. That’s you off into the sunset now is it?
    
    I wouldn’t go that far. Conor laughs. She’d be quite thick like. 
    
    That has me spitting my Guinness out. You can count on Conor never to sugar coat it.
    
    So how’s your da then? Says Rory.
    
    Grand! I say. Aye grand. Nothing too serious. Right. Another round then lads? Liam offers to come to the bar.
    
    As we wait for the drinks he asks me again. So things are good with your da? We’re watching the barman, not looking at each other.
    
    Oh aye. I say. I think so. 
    
    Right. He says, putting a hand on my shoulder. But if you need to talk. 
    
    Right. I say. Yes. I put my hand on his shoulder too. Then we both drop them. What were my hands doing before? Just by my sides was it? Doesn’t seem right.
    
    I look around for something else to talk about, anything. I spot a familiar face on Liam’s left. Brown eyes. Long shiny hair. Sean’s little sister’s friend, or cousin? But what’s her name? Geraldine? No. Katy? If I introduce her to Liam she might say it.
    
    Alright. I say. I lean over and touch the inside of her wrist. She smiles. Good to see you. Very good to see you. I say. Oh and this is my friend Liam.
    
    Hello, I’m Roxanne. She says. Jesus, yes. Roxanne. How did I go forgetting that one? Not too many of those you meet.
    
    She glances away from me to nod politely at him. Then she’s back, smiling up at me. There’s something in her face. Adoration? I mean, she’s drunk. But she clearly has a thing for me.
    
    I was almost not going to say hello there. She says. I wasn’t sure you’d recognise me.
    
    What. You? I say, laughing. No, I wouldn’t have forgotten you. I can see her face flush. If there’s one thing I know about women it’s that they all want to think they’re unforgettable. So what are you at tonight? I say.
    
    Oh it’s a friend’s birthday. Upstairs.
    
    A birthday is it? I say. And what age is it? 
    
    It’s her twenty-fourth. She says. Actually it was mine too there, a few weeks ago. 
    
    I glance at Liam, I can’t help it. And then I bark with laughter at the look on his face. I rub my mouth right after, as if I could wipe the laugh away. That starts Liam laughing too.
    
    What’s the joke? She says.
    
    Ah it’s too long a story. I say. It’s not a good joke anyway.
    
    Right. Liam says, nodding to the pints. Will we get these back upstairs? 
    
    She hugs both of us before she heads back off to her birthday, but she definitely lingers on me.
    
    Those looks will fade. Liam says, laughing, on the way up the stairs. I tell you.
    
    Do you reckon she was that good looking? I say. I think it’s the long hair. Picture her without it like. 
    
    Oh god. He says. Guinness sloshes out of one of his glasses and onto the floor. I didn’t mean her.
    
    I know. I know. I say, laughing. Believe me. I am well aware. 
    
    As we approach our seats I get the fright of my life. Ciara is sitting in the booth, nodding along as Rory talks. She’s frowning in concentration. She always looks like that when she’s listening. And she always says sure, a lot, and nods. And you feel like she understands. And you find you can talk to her about anything. And then whatever she says about it is always surprising, because you can never really tell what she’s thinking. Which is not the only surprising thing about her. For example, every time I see her naked I’m surprised at how muscular her arms and back are, because her hands are so delicate. And every summer, when she has freckles on her nose, there is something strange about that, something uncharacteristically childlike. And the last time I slept with her I found myself saying I would end things with Kimberly. And I was surprised I’d said it but didn’t want to take it back. I couldn’t tell what she was thinking, though, which was terrifying.
    
    She took a photograph of me later that morning. She’d never done that before. I asked if I could see it and she said no, but she did show me some others. She asked me to help her choose between five to submit for an exhibition. I barely remember the photos. But I can still see her hands pointing out certain details. Then she had to go to work at the museum shop.
    
    She turns around and sees us and the concentration in her face opens out into a smile. A bright smile, but with cheekiness underneath it, with raised eyebrows. I feel like I’ve been kicked in the stomach. My face goes red. The thing is nobody else smiles like that.
    
    Hello! She says. She doesn’t stand up.
    
    Right. Hello. I say. My voice sounds shrill. Right. So, what are you doing here?
    
    It’s good to see you too. She says. The birthday I’m at is upstairs and I thought I’d have a wander around. I had a feeling you’d be here too. 
    
    Yes. No. Good to see you. Of course. I say. Great to see you, definitely. Yes. So it’s upstairs? Whose birthday is it again? I can feel my face going redder and redder.
    
    I don’t think you know them. She says.
    
    Right. Yes. I say. So what age are they turning?
    
    What? She says. Why are you so interested in this birthday? She’s the same age as me.
    
    Right. Yes. No. Great. No reason. I glance at Liam.
    
    What is it? She says. Why are you looking at Liam?
    
    Someone we know was out for a birthday pub crawl, we were hoping to avoid it. But he’s older. 
    
    Right I see. She says, shaking her head. I don’t know if she believes me. Well, Rory was just telling us about his Tinder exploits. It sounds tough out there. You were in the middle of the latest one? Did you hear from her again?
    
    Rory starts on about the date they’d had, and how well it had gone, and the follow up messages. I wonder how she’s got him onto this. But that’s what she’s like. She doesn’t seem like she’s judging you, so you find yourself telling her things. I told her that once. I’m not judging. She said. Or I try not to. You can’t get anything out of anyone that way. I hadn’t a clue what to do with that response. I tried to make a joke out of it, saying that if the photography thing didn’t work out she would make a great therapist. I think it’s all the same thing really. She said. I mean, I think that’s what art is about. Trying to understand people better. I didn’t know what to say to that. The sincerity of it.
    
    Liam and I take our seats. I’m opposite Ciara and I consider stroking her leg with my foot under the table.  I don’t even realise how bad an idea that is until my left foot is poised and ready to go. We sip our pints as Rory talks. She catches me looking at her as Rory is explaining about how he saw this girl out, after being ignored, and she pretended she’d got a new phone, and smiles.
    
    Do you fancy another drink? I say to her. We’ll go to the bar, will we? It’s my round.
    
    Thank you. She says. But I’m not drinking, actually.
    
    Right. I say. Right. Yes. Just tonight or? 
    
    No. Not just tonight. She says, smiling. I’m not really a good drinker, you know.
    
    When did that happen? I say.
    
    She laughs. What, not being a good drinker? I think always. I stopped four months ago, actually five next week. I’ll tell you all about it later. I should head back up here, but we’re going back to Claire’s after. You should all come. 
    
    Right enough. Rory says, as if she’s inviting him personally.
    
    Yes. I say, shooting him a look. Yes, we’ll all come. 
    
    Liam watches her walk across the room then turns to me. I would actually take another there, if it’s your round again?
    
    When last orders are called they’ve had six pints each. I’ve slowed down and stuck to four. Not exactly as sober as Ciara will be, but not far off. My phone is out on the table so I can see when messages come in. More from Kimberly light up the screen. I leave them. It’s not out of the question that I’d have had an early night.
    
    When I glance over and it’s Ciara’s message I grab it off the table. Liam and Conor snort with laughter.
    
    Look at you. Says Conor. Get a hold of yourself man. Liam laughs harder and Rory asks what we’re laughing at.
    
    We go into an off-licence on the walk over but we needn’t have bothered. There’s gin, vodka, whiskey, even tequila, gathered on the kitchen counter. It’s a tiny, grotty space. There’s a white cooker with its steel legs visible. Plywood cupboards. A plastic table with wooden chairs. I make us vodka lemonades and we head through to the front room where people are sitting on tattered sofas or standing in small groups.
    
    Ciara introduces us to birthday girl Claire. She has an oily chin and her hair is too short for her face so your eye can’t help but be drawn to it. Happy birthday, thanks for having us! I tell her, as we go round in a circle, saying our names. Right, good to meet you. Says Liam.
    
    Yes! Says Rory.
    
    Great. And what’s your name? I hear her ask him, as I take a seat on the sofa arm beside Ciara. A boy is drawing out lines on a shiny black book balanced on his knee.
    
    One for your friend too? He asks Ciara. Ciara turns her head to look up at me.
    
    You are? I say to her. She nods.
    
    Is it coke? I say to your man. He nods. Aye go on then. Thank you. I can stick you some money over? 
    
    Na, don’t worry about it. He says, as he goes back to organising the lines.
    
    She turns to me. I know. I know. But I’m not trying to be totally sober, like. She says. I had an edible earlier. I would still do coke, MD, whatever. Acid the odd time. Not ket, but you know I never did. Drugs never did me in the way drinking did, though. She smiles. I suppose I wouldn’t ever have afforded a drug problem. So there’s that too. She laughs. It’s not exactly a real laugh, but not totally without humour either.
    
    I hold my hands up. I didn’t say anything. No judgement from me. I could stand to cut back on the drink too.
    
    Well it’s getting older, isn’t it. She says, nodding. Can’t treat your body like shite. 
    
    I watch her cover one nostril with her thumb as she snorts her line. She wipes powder from her nostril with one finger. Gracefully, somehow. Then she passes me the book.
    
    When I look up from my line Rory is sitting there grinning at me. Any of that going? He says. I want nothing more than to tell him to go away, well away, but Ciara asks her friend before I can say anything. He says that’s grand.
    
    Thank you. Says Rory, still grinning. So here, how are the photographs going?
    
    Well. She says, glancing behind her to check on the progress of his line. They’re going. No. Yes, it’s going alright.
    
    I’d have thought there’d be no money in it? He says.
    
    God is there not? She says. There was me thinking there was. Well, thank you for telling me. 
    
    Rory takes the book. She has a good way of dealing with questions like that. Or if someone tries to wind her up deliberately, rather than just being gormless like Rory, saying what about a pension or buying a house, she’ll say something like: Well I don’t draw a pension yet, I’m not even thirty or I’m not in the market for a house just now, but thanks for asking. She raises her eyebrows as if it’s all a big joke. It’s not just the eyebrows, though, it’s the whole demeanour. It’s impossible to embarrass her, you only end up looking stupid yourself. I don’t know how she does it, but I suppose if I did it wouldn’t work.
    
    Well, here, it’s good to see you. She says to me. What brought you back? You said your dad was it?
    
    With Rory listening in I can’t very well go into the whole situation. I tell her he’s fine, mostly, having issues with his mobility and cooking, and that I offered to come back for a week or so.
    
    A week or so? Right. She nods. And what’s Kimberly at then? Did she come back too?
    
    I glance at Rory. He takes that as his invitation to speak. You were saying she was at a wedding? He says. Or was that tomorrow?
    
    I can’t see Ciara’s face and I don’t dare to turn around.
    
    Well of course it’s today. I say, tutting. Who gets married on a Sunday? Have you ever known anyone to get married on a Sunday? 
    
    Fair enough, yes. He says, nodding pensively. You’re right, now you say it. They don’t, do they? So it’s today? And who is it? That’s the worst thing about Rory. You can’t even snap at him. He doesn’t notice. Everything bounces off him.
    
    One of Kimberley’s friends. I say. A school friend, I don’t know her so well. 
    
    I hear Ciara laugh from down at my elbow. A real laugh, with warmth and depth to it. There’s no snideness I can detect. So you thought you’d get out of it, did you? Didn’t fancy a night out with the girlies? She says. You used your dad to get out of it? What are you like! 
    
    No. No, he did need help. I say, laughing too, trying not to sound nervous. No, the two things are separate. I would have gone. I didn’t not want to go, no. I look down at her and she raises her eyebrows, but I don’t get the sense I’m in real trouble.
    
    The book comes back again. We each do another line. I scan the room, checking if Liam or Conor is nearby for me to send Rory their way. Liam is in the corner, chatting to a pretty girl wearing a leather skirt. Great legs. Not fair to land him with it. No sign of Conor. Right, he’s my problem then.
    
    I like weddings. Says Rory. He’s gazing into the distance with his dreamy look. I like the dancing, all the different age groups. Good craic. 
    
    Hmm. Says Ciara. I suppose it depends who’s getting married.
    
    Yes. Good craic. I say, searching in what he’s said, for a hook to a different conversation.
    
    Have you thought for yourself man? He says to me, still with the dreamy expression. Would you be getting married anytime soon? Would you propose, do you reckon? 
    
    Ciara laughs. A sharp bark. But still warm, on balance. I think.
    
    Right. Well, no. I say. No, I hadn’t planned. I won’t. With Kimberley. I don’t think it’s the right thing. It’s a for now thing.
    
    Is it? Says Rory. Oh I didn’t know that. Now his face is imploring. As if I’ve said something grave.
    
    I don’t think he knows what he wants either, Rory. She says. Or he does but he says one thing and he means another. That’s what he’s like.
    
    Oh. Says Rory. Oh right.
    
    I can tell she’s looking at me, not Rory. He stares at me too, with doleful eyes. I turn to face her.
    
    It’s complicated. I say. That’s all it is. 
    
    What’s complicated? She says.
    
    You know. We live together. I say. Her dad owns the house.
    
    She looks at me like I’ve announced I’ve an alien with me, hiding under my jacket. Jesus Christ. She says, kneading her forehead. So you move somewhere else. That’s what you do in that situation. You. Move.
    
    No. I say. No, but it’s not that easy. It’s not the same as it is for you. To just move. You don’t have to. Well. It’s not as easy. I stop myself from saying that she just does what she wants. Because I know what she’ll say to that: why don’t I? And I have no good answer there.   
    
    No, go on. She says. What is it I don’t have to do? Really? How can it be my fault if you don’t like your life? It’s nothing to do with me. No, you know what? I won’t have it. I have to make the same choices as anyone else. I don’t have a magic key or whatever it is you think I have. You can all joke about me not having money or whatever stupid thing it is next time. Have a good laugh. But you can’t carry on as if I have a magic key at the same time. 
    
    Oh no I wasn’t joking. Says Rory. I’m sorry. 
    
    Shut. Up. She says, without turning her head.
    
    Sorry, yes. He says. Right. I’m away to take a piss here. He gets up and slides out of his corner, his stomach almost grazes our faces.
    
    I didn’t say you had a magic key. I say. I can sense the room watching us. That’s not what I said. 
    
    Don’t speak to me like I’m stupid. She says. Don’t give me that. You know the key is metaphorical. You know what I’m talking about. 
    
    She’s right. I do know what the magic key is: it’s when I act as if she’s been given special permission from someone, somewhere, to live the way she wants to and I haven’t. The fact is neither of us has special permission. Or, I suppose we both do. You could look at it that way.
    
    Sorry, yes. I say. I do know. I shouldn’t have said that. I’m sorry.
    
    Right. Let’s forget about it. She says. Is there another line of coke there?
    
    She snorts hers then passes me the book. I’m glad of the conciliatory gesture, thinking we really are putting it behind us. Then she starts talking.
    
    So the wedding was today and you flew in this morning? She says. And you texted me today. Right. And when did your dad get out of the hospital? 
    
    I weigh up whether I should lie. No, not worth it.
    
    Right. I say. So it was two weeks ago he got out. But he was saying he was fine. And he was saying his girlfriend was there. Well, no. It’s not that he was saying she was, but he wasn’t saying she wasn’t, if you get me.  
    
    Yes. She says. So when did he ask you back?
    
    Thursday. I say. And then with work.
    
    But you could have come on Friday? You could have come to help your dad on the Friday. She says. When are you leaving? Actually you know what, don’t bother? I’m going to head home here. 
    
    I don’t think she’s serious but then she’s on her feet and getting her things together, saying goodbye to her friends while everyone looks at me like I’ve about seventy heads. God knows what she’d have done if I’d told the truth about when he called.
    
    I smile and nod and follow her out into the street. She’s about a dozen houses away but she’s not running. That’s something.
    
    Ciara! I shout. She stops instantly; the second good sign. That’s another thing I know about women, though. They all love a big, grand display. Even Ciara. To be chased after, phoned in the middle of the night, praised in superlatives. You can make up for a lot by doing something like that. You just have to not be embarrassed to do it. Look, I’m sorry! I shout. Here, wait there. I jog towards her.
    
    She’s standing under a lamp post, framed by orange light. I try to get a read of her body language, planning what to say. Her arms are folded, but her shoulders are hunched. She’s made herself small. She’s not poised for a shouting match; it’s a hug I think.
    
    I pull her towards me and she doesn’t push back. No, she wraps her arms around me, tighter than I was expecting. Her face is buried in such a way that it takes me a few seconds to realise she’s crying.
    
    Ciara? I whisper. I try to lift her head but she shakes it, presses herself further into my chest.
    
    It’s the coke. I can hear her say. It’s the coke. It’s the coke. I’m crying because we did all that coke. 
    
    I smooth her hair. The thing is she won’t have wanted to make a scene. I wait until I feel her body relax.
    
    Will we go back to yours? I whisper.
    
    She pulls away. Slowly, though. She wipes under her eyes. No. She says. I don’t think so, you know. 
    
    It’s a no that wants to be a yes, though. A no that wants to be talked around.
    
    Just to talk, I mean. I say.
    
    She laughs, the relieved laugh that often follows a cry. That’s what we do isn’t it?
    
    I’m not that drunk. I say. If you don’t want to take me home because you think I’m too drunk, I can promise you I’m not that drunk.  
    
    She wipes under her eyes again. No it’s not that. 
    
    If it’s because you have things to do tomorrow then I promise I’ll leave, I won’t be a pest. 
    
    No it’s not that. I don’t have work tomorrow. 
    
    If there’s someone you’re seeing you can tell me. I say. I’m a big boy. 
    
    No. Nobody in particular anyway. 
    
    I can see I’m getting there. I take her hands.
    
    Seriously. I say. The wedding. I explained that badly. I know. Words start coming from nowhere. When my dad got out of hospital he was saying it was all fine, and he never mentioned your woman had left. I don’t even know when she did. I don’t think it’s specifically the operation. But he is bad. Jesus, you should see him. 
    
    She squeezes my hands. I can feel every emotion I’ve had for the entire day fighting to get to the surface.
    
    And it’s just me. I can’t. 
    
    I know. She says, she moves her thumbs up and down the outside of my hands. I breathe in and out. I know. He’s a drinker too, isn’t he?
    
    Oh, yes. I say. Well yes but no. He’s a big drinker, like. But that’s not the problem. It’s more like a nervous breakdown, I suppose you would call it? I want to laugh but I’m scared I’ll lose control and cry. You know that kind of way? 
    
    Yes. She says. I think I know. 
    
    You know what it is? He won’t face up to anything. Words from nowhere again. I don’t know what happened with this woman this time, but it’s always the same. It never works out, and then she’ll vanish, and he’s back to square one. It’s like he can’t see the consequences of anything, or he doesn’t want to. Then things never work out how he wants. With my mum, you know, that was predictable to everyone but him. He never got over her, you know. I stop for more deep breaths.
    
    I know. She says, massaging my hands with her thumbs.
    
    This time he seems to just want to hide himself away. I say. It’s like he never accepted his life was his real life. Do you know that kind of way?
    
    I think I know the way you mean. She says.
    
    Right, sure. I smile, the threat of a cry seems to have dissipated. Yes, fair play. 
    
    We can get a coffee if you want to talk about your dad? She says. This week sometime?
    
    What, still no? I say.
    
    You don’t really want a pity fuck. She says but she hasn’t dropped her hands.
    
    I might. I say.
    
    She laughs then.
    
    Does anyone make you laugh like I do? I say. Anyone else? I’m pulling out all the stops here. I didn’t even call you crazy earlier. I could have. 
    
    Thank you. She says. Thank you for affording me that dignity.
    
    I know why you’re annoyed. I say. I said I was thinking of leaving Kimberley and didn’t. But can I remind you, you never said anything in that conversation. You didn’t say to do it. You said nothing. 
    
    It’s not my decision to make. She says.
    
    That’s not it. I say. The truth of it is you don’t think it would work between us. But I know it could. 
    
    She smiles. So there’s your decision made?
    
    You still haven’t said what you think. 
    
    Do you think you wouldn’t resent me if you had to live with me?
    
    Well, you wouldn’t. There’s lots of things you don’t do. For example, you wouldn’t want me to propose. 
    
    She shakes her head. I’m not sure that sounds how you want it to sound. 
    
    You know what I mean. 
    
    You’re right. I wouldn’t want that. Don’t propose. She says. Here, do you know what the phrase object permanence means?
    
    What? I say. Actually, yes. Yes I do. It’s when a baby can’t remember their toy unless it’s in front of them. But no. I don’t have that. If that’s what you’re saying I have. 
    
    For a few seconds I think she’s going to kiss me.
    
    Right. I’m away to bed, here. She says. Goodnight.
    
    She still hasn’t let go of my hands. To bed? You just had to ask. I say. One last try, why not.
    
    She squeezes my hands before dropping them.
    
    Then the coffee? I say. Let’s do that. This week.
    
    Sounds good. She says. Text me.
    
    I watch her walk down the street. I think about running after her but this time the grand display is to let her go.
    
    Back at my da’s I find his lordship asleep on the sofa in his newly-clean living room. Not lying down, just sitting with his head slumped forward.
    
    No chance of getting him up the stairs. I pull the blanket out from under him and try to negotiate him onto his side. He grumbles in his sleep and starts to hum.
    
    In the name of the Father. He shouts. His eyes open.
    
    Jesus don’t get religious on me now boyo. I whisper.
    
    What? He says. Son. What? My son. You’re my son. You’re the same as you always were.
    
    Right. I say. Thank you. Bed now. 
    
    He lies down on his side and is straight back asleep. He’ll have no memory of this in the morning. As if he’d bring it up if he did.
    
    I sit down on the bed and get my phone out. I can see messages from Kimberley. I swipe them off the screen. I open my chat with Ciara.
    
    I type: Talk tomorrow? No, no question mark. Jesus Christ, man. Not a question mark. What are you playing at? No, but not nothing after that tomorrow. Can’t just leave it sitting there like that. xx? Aye, try that.
    
    I type: Home safe? Talk tomorrow xx. Yes, much better. Send.
    
    And I do mean it. We will talk. I’ll text, I might even call. She’d like that.
    
    I can see her friends from last night asking about me. What was his craic, then? Did you get rid of him. She could say: oh aye, he’s always chasing after me but he has a girlfriend he won’t leave. He’s lonely because of stuff with his dad, and he’s had a big crush on me from way back.
    
    Jesus she could tell them I phone her every year on Christmas Eve and if she doesn’t answer I leave about seven messages and voice messages too. God the things she could say.
    
    But she wouldn’t do that. I trust her. That’s probably why I do any of that stuff.
    
    I’ll tell her that tomorrow. Or I’ll as much as tell her. I’ll say, I appreciate you not making a big thing or what have you the other night. She’ll know what I mean.
    
    She replies instantly: Yes! Just in. Speak tomorrow xxxx
    
    Four x’s? Very nice.
    
    There’s a conversation there we haven’t ended. I’ll pick it up tomorrow. But, whatever, tomorrow doesn’t solve tonight.
    
    I open up Instagram and type Roxanne into the search. No hits in the first few profiles. I try a different spelling before navigating to Sean’s profile. I search his followers under Rox. Yes, there she is. Bingo! Follows me already. Good stuff.
    
    I unzip my jeans and reach my right hand into my boxers. I swipe through her photos with my hand on my dick, using my left hand to navigate the phone. Holiday photos in a bikini. Night out photos in bodycon dresses. Not doing it. Probably can’t even get hard in person because of the coke. But in the morning? Different story. I click follow back and then open up the messages.
    
    What would be the worst thing I could possibly send her?
    
    I want you to suck my dick and then let me cum on your tits and then let me spread it all over them while I finger you
    
    I smile at that. Tame in my old age.
    
    I want to bend you over your bed and fuck you in the ass
    Will you let me cum in your asshole?
    I’m scared about my dad and I’m lonely. Can I spend the night with you?
    I’m a spineless prick
    
    Jesus. God. Fuck.
    
    I type: I really want to fuck you so badly. Delete it.
    The really. Too much?
    I type it out again: I want to fuck you so badly
    Somehow more too much than it was with the really.
    I type: I really want to fuck you sooo badly 
    
    Yes! Send!
    
    I can see she’s read it. The moment of truth. She starts typing. She replies: Hello! You still out then? "

    "text": "Finn opened the door. Finn Lykke opened the door wearing jeans and a freshly-ironed, white shirt, he had made an effort. He gave me a hug and I felt more at ease while it lasted. Unni, Helle and I followed him into the living room which looked much like the living room where we had spent last Saturday except this one was empty, there was no one on the sofa, Finn said that Stein and Lars had gone to get beer; fortunately they soon turned up with bags that jingled with promise and set them down on the table, it was starting to look like a party. We opened the beers and drank and Finn sat down next to me and put his arm around me and seemed taller than the last time we had seen each other and much more relaxed than last Saturday, what a difference one meeting on an ordinary Wednesday could make. They had played an ice hockey match that morning and had won, they said, and they drank to that and clinked their bottles, we all drank to that, and Finn had scored a goal, they said, and described it and I imagined Finn in his ice hockey kit, his helmet and cage and big shoulder pads, how he wove and criss-crossed his way forward, hitting the puck with his stick, slamming it into the goal. I realised that I was more in love with the version of him in his ice hockey kit than the one sitting next to me on the sofa, I avoided looking at him, I drank.

    Luckily Lars put on some music so loud that it was difficult to talk, that was the whole point, I guess, he pulled Unni out on the floor and Stein pulled Helle out on the floor and Finn pulled me out on the floor and we danced with a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other, Lars changed the records and we danced more slowly and we set down the bottles and stubbed out the cigarettes and put our arms around each other and started to make out.
    
    We made out to lots of songs before Finn took my hand and guided me out into the hallway where no lights were on and there, in the twilight, we made out more passionately. He pressed me softly against the wall and slipped his right hand under my jumper and under my best bra and cupped my breast as promisingly as he had done in the playground at Berg College just a few days ago, and after what I thought was nice but long enough, he removed his hand, took mine and led me towards the stairs, then up the stairs, up the steps to the first floor where I assumed the bedrooms were.
    
    I will never forget it, the stairs leading up to what I guessed must be the bedrooms. The carpet stair runner, burgundy with a golden border which didn’t go right to the sides of the steps so you could see the wood, the runner itself was kept in position by thin metal rods in the corners of each riser. How strange, I thought while Finn Lykke led me up the stairs to the first floor that I was on my way to something I would never forget, which would become a chapter in my life, one of the most important. Even before it had happened, I already knew that it would be a chapter in my life that I would never forget, I knew in advance that it would be unforgettable. How strange was that? On my way up the stairs on a burgundy runner with a golden border held in place by thin brass rods in the corners of each riser behind Finn Lykke in his jeans and freshly-ironed, white shirt.
    
    We reached a passage with four closed doors, he walked to the one furthest to the left and I followed with my hand in his until he let go of it, opened the door and turned on the light in what looked like a guest bedroom, it seemed uninhabited. A made-up bed and a bedside table, a window facing the road with the curtains closed, a sink to the left of the door, a chair to the right. He closed the door behind us and started to undress, he undid, without fear it seemed to me, the buttons of his freshly-ironed, white shirt, took it off and tossed it on the chair, bent over his belt and the zip of his jeans, took them off and tossed them on the chair as if I weren’t there, then he took off his socks, first one, then the other and stood in front of me in his underpants, then he took off his underpants and stood naked in front of me with fair pubic hair and blond tufts under his armpits, small, almost inverted nipples, but he didn’t seem to notice me. Suddenly he looked lost and went back to the clothes he had just thrown on the chair, picked up his jeans and searched the pockets and while he was busy doing that, looking for something in the pockets of his jeans, I undressed as quickly as I could in order to do it without him looking at me, I put my clothes on the bedside table, my best jumper, my best trousers, my best bra, my best knickers and socks, I put everything on the bedside table and slipped under the bedspread and the duvet while he was still rummaging around his pockets for something without saying a word, in a great silence. I lay under the duvet, watching him, naked, with fair pubic hair and blond tufts under his armpits, then he found what he was looking for, a condom, I could see, which he tried to open, but couldn’t. He tried to tear off the wrapper, but he still couldn’t, he had to use his teeth to finally get it out and then he tried to put it on, but failed because he didn’t have an erection, his small, pale, flaccid penis dangled between his thighs. I turned carefully and slowly towards the wall so the bed wouldn’t creak and draw his attention to me, but my ears pricked up when I heard the snapping of rubber and his breathing, his frustrated breathing because he couldn’t put on the condom. Then I heard him approach the bed, he came towards the bed in which I lay and he lifted up the duvet and climbed in and lay down behind me, leaned on his elbow and touched my shoulder in order to turn me over. I turned over voluntarily, I rolled onto my back and he kissed me and got on top of me and started moving his hips in the way men do during sex, as I had seen in Unni’s dad’s porn magazines and his blue movies, and which I had so often imagined and dreamed about, except Finn wasn’t inside me. I didn’t know much, but this much I did know because I used tampons when I had my period and knew what it was like to have something inside me, and he wasn’t. His head slumped over my shoulder, his panting wet mouth brushed my neck, he moved his hips as men do during sex, except this wasn’t intercourse because he wasn’t inside me, I didn’t know much, but this much I did know.
    
    I whispered to him that he wasn’t inside me. Finn, you’re not inside me, but he didn’t seem to hear me, he was wrapped up in himself, his panting breath against my neck, the back of his neck flushed and tense. Finn, you’re not inside me, but he carried on thrusting his hips against mine, he leaned on me with all of his body, with his whole weight, with his face in the nape of my neck and his hair in my mouth. Finn, you’re not inside me, but he still didn’t hear, he panted and groaned and pushed, then he suddenly stopped, raised himself up on his hands and swung his legs over the side of the bed, he got up and stood in front of me, he still didn’t have an erection and the condom slipped off. He bent down, retrieved it and held it up to the light from the ceiling lamp to study it, went over to the sink, turned on the tap and filled the condom with water, he held it up to the light once more and examined it to make sure it hadn’t burst, he said, so he did know that I was there. He had filled the condom with water and held it up to the ceiling light to see if there was a tear or a hole in it, but it looked intact.
    
    I sat up slowly and swung my legs over the side of the bed, I took the opportunity to get dressed while he checked if there was a hole or a tear in the condom he had put on his penis, which hadn’t been inside me, my best knickers, my best bra, jumper and trousers and socks and I tiptoed to the door, I put my hand on the handle and turned to him and said that I was going to join the others. He glanced at me and nodded, busy with his own stuff, the condom. I walked down the stairs I had only just walked up so filled with anticipation, on the burgundy stair runner with the golden border kept in place by slim gold- coloured metal rods at the corners of each riser, on my way down from something I would never forget, which would become a chapter in my life, a defining moment. I could hear music from the living room, soft and romantic, the others were making out in the corners of separate sofas, but they stopped when I came in and they looked at me curiously, Helle and Unni with grave and solemn faces, I smiled cautiously and sat down in a vacant corner and could feel their eyes on me, but I didn’t say anything, there wasn’t much to say, after all, there was nothing to tell. Then we heard footsteps on the stairs and in the hallway, and soon afterwards Finn Lykke entered the living room, nicely dressed in jeans and a slightly crumpled white shirt and made a beeline for the sofa where I was sitting, he had a smug smile on his face and his gait was like Unni’s when she walked into the playground in the morning after spending the previous evening with Lars behind the bus shelter after the Workers Youth League meetings. Finn entered the living room and walked towards me with his new, casual swagger, as proud as a peacock, sat down next to me, put his arm around my shoulder and whispered in my ear: Now I’ve made a woman of you.
    
    And that’s how I became a woman.

    "text": "An hour before surgery Dr Duncan ducked into the men’s bathroom. The women’s was another twenty-minute walk away and usually, on this side of the hospital, the bathroom was empty. But there was Ian, a surgical resident, posed against the grotty sinks. His phone lifted above his head, angled down, one hand moving beneath the blue of his scrubs. The moment he saw her, he stopped. A statue. But he did not withdraw his hand. The shape of his fingers flattened as he launched into an apology.

    It’s just a photo, he spoke softly. It’s just a photo, honestly.
    
    I shouldn’t have been in here, Dr Duncan replied. It’s fine.
    
    Still he did not withdraw his hand. He put his phone beside the sink, screen down. Unhygienic, she thought, looking at the phone, imagining the dirty glass pressed to his ear. The bathroom’s details were otherwise familiar. She knew which cubicle had the cracked toilet seat, which tap ran viciously hot. Before he could say anything else she stepped back into the corridor.
    
    Had things gone differently, Dr Duncan would have let Ian take the lead on the appendectomy. He’d have had the opportunity to gently push the tube, containing the light and camera, through the opened belly button and watch the inching of the large intestine as it appeared on the screen. Instead she would perform the first cut. Skin prised underneath the blade. The camera sunk in. She would have remarked, had Ian been holding the scalpel, that the large intestine was like a sea monster, mythical, moved along by its own pink pulse. She would have shaken her head and expressed her awe at the human body, asked him to consider that he might be the only person to ever see this part of the patient, that it was important not to let the significance of that intimacy pass you by. But Dr Duncan had changed her mind.
    
    Ian paused, seemingly unfazed, beside the operating table. His hands in blue latex gloves. He did everything handsomely. He was gay, very gay, in his own words, and the other female residents flocked to him, knowing they wanted a piece of the ancient light that bounced off his body.
    
    At Dr Duncan’s command, Ian dutifully took the disposal razor and tried to shave the top rows of the patient’s pubic hair. He struggled to find the right angle, twisting his elbows this way and that, dragging too lightly across the tough hairs, then too hard, threatening to nick the skin. One of the nurses flinched. When it was done, the low boil of a rash left behind, he did not look at Dr Duncan. He focused on the screen that showed the camera’s worming journey.
    
    This would be the last operation of Dr Duncan’s shift. Later she would collect her son from the airport. He’d chosen a cheap flight, one that landed just before midnight. She had not seen him in a few months. Alex, who had grown up to be tall and broad, who was also handsome.
    
    As the camera advanced through the bowel, she hummed quietly, a kind of theme tune. Alex had got into a decent university, if a little far away, and at eighteen was now old enough that they indulged in similar tastes; he claimed to like red wine, which he swished and swilled, named music she remembered from when she was his age. He’d told her, on his last visit, that he and his friends had drunk the bottle she’d sent to him out of stained mugs, knowing it might rile her. She resisted. Well, as long as you enjoyed it. Oh, we did, he said, insinuating what was just out of shot, the part of the picture she couldn’t see.
    
    Through the belly button she filled the patient’s abdomen with gas, pushing out the walls of the large intestine, making it easier to navigate the sluggish turns. After that came the camera and the private, fleshy undertones, the surfaces slick and shining.
    
    The appendix appeared. Half of it already distended, deep maroon, a twisted and flashing smile. Dr Duncan was satisfied. She had been right. The patient, who had arrived yesterday evening, complaining of pain in her right-hand side, no fever but an elevated white blood cell count, had been suffering from appendicitis. Now it had been caught before a perforation. She announced this to Ian, asked him to look at the appendix, veins drifting thin as hair, the bloated glow. He nodded over her shoulder. Briefly her elbow made contact with his chest.
    
    The patient had tattoos. Not only down her arms but, as Dr Duncan looked back at her body from the screen, along the tops of her thighs. One was a quote in cursive that was too difficult to read upside down, then a giant flower, maybe a magnolia, that bloomed all the way to her knee. There was a smaller scene, birds across a sunset, a boat, the whole thing very elaborate.
    
    Dr Duncan had her own tattoo. In black ink along her ribs, on the left-hand side. It was Alex’s full name, Alexander, done when he was already twelve years old. She’d practised writing it out beforehand, wanted it in lower case, lengthening the first ‘e’ so it would not be immediately recognisable as his, adding a flourish to the ‘r’. A literal impulse, she knew. Her body was already marked by his birth, the scar of the C-section faint but still visible across her stomach. It was around the time that the name she’d given him had begun to permanently change, his loud friends calling him Al, or, inexplicably, X. Her ex-husband, too, who had never said Alexander. Right from the beginning, he had always used Alex. These were the names her son chose to have on his homework, the signatures he gave on her birthday cards.
    
    At the parlour, sitting on an old leather sofa, she’d been asked about placement. The tattoo artist listed body parts with bizarre distortions, inside finger, soft bit of forearm, lower-back dip, upper-back spine, pelvic gutter. Just somewhere it won’t be seen, she’d stated. He’d twisted then, pointed to his own ribcage. Yes, there.
    
    Dr Duncan clamped and quickly clipped the appendix free. It was then scooped out in a small wire basket, which, despite the meticulously tried and tested design, always made Dr Duncan think of catching fish in a deep-fat fryer. At the incision’s entrance, she repositioned and slowly pulled the appendix through. The patient’s skin puckered, beastly, glorious, protesting with an organised spill of blood.
    
    Hey presto, she said aloud.
    
    Ian smiled too large behind his mask, she saw the lift of his eyes, thrilled by a catchphrase that barely belonged to her.
    
    The whole idea, she added quickly, was of course to avoid perforation while it was still inside the body, thus the basket, thus the swift and gentle exit.
    
    Thus, Ian echoed, hey presto.
    
    Dr Duncan did not advance. She let the appendix hover over the patient’s body. In Ian’s tone she’d heard the arrogance of a private joke, where no joke had been shared. He stood, hands outstretched and empty. She took another few seconds. Brought the appendix close to her face. Saw again confirmation that her instincts were good, that she’d been right to operate. She pinched it and felt the leathery resistance of the infected end. The other half was still bright, spongy. Another couple of days though, even one more day, and it might have burst.
    
    She passed it on to Ian, who stepped away. Set the appendix in a metal bowl. A nurse collected it. From this moment on it would become a specimen, sent to the hospital lab for a few further tests, which would most likely reveal nothing they couldn’t already see.
    
    On the way to the airport she would need to stop at the supermarket. Dr Duncan wondered whether she should buy the body wash her son liked. Last time she’d noticed, when she’d gone into the bathroom after he’d used it, a strong minty smell that carried on the residual steam. He’d brought with him small, travel-size containers, a brand she didn’t recognise at first but had since seen in a pharmacy, on the shelves of the supermarket. Maybe he used something different, now. That had been two, no, three months ago.
    
    The small opening in the large intestine was stapled shut. Gas was released from the patient’s abdomen. Later she might experience a pain both sharp and blunt between her shoulder blades, as if she had been flicked and the flick had held, as a few escaped bubbles travelled north. The patient, hopefully, would have only one night in hospital before being discharged. There had been an anomaly, blood in her urine, but this could be an oncoming period, unrelated to the appendicitis. On admission the patient could not remember where she was in her cycle. Mid? she’d replied, eyebrows raised, as if this was something Dr Duncan could confirm.
    
    She allowed Ian to stitch the incision across the abdomen. She pointed at the opened belly button, the smaller, second incision to the left.
    
    Do those too, and do them well.
    
    He nodded, his eyes on the abdomen.
    
    Yes?
    
    Yes, I’ll do them.
    
    Alex saw her tattoo when he was thirteen, a year or so after she’d had it done. They were on a beach holiday and she’d opted to wear a bikini. It was just the two of them, her divorce already under way and her ex-husband living moodily in a new city. She waited, that first day in the sun, for Alex to ask what was written beneath her armpit. He stalked the shoreline, crouching to sort through shells, his legs and ankles thick with those interim years, his body not yet ascended into the muscle and stretch of teenagedom. He glanced at her tattoo, or at least she thought he had, but said nothing. She became bolder, turned, angled her left-hand side so it faced him. Still nothing. He was a private child and it seemed he’d given her this in return, a privacy, whether she wanted it or not. She supposed, applying suncream to the backs of his legs, his neck, the tops of his ears, the places he forgot, that this was being a mother.
    
    The nurses wheeled the patient into the recovery bay. Many patients, as they saw Dr Duncan standing over their bodies, the pain of which they could not yet feel, would sob softly. She knew that this was for various, impersonal reasons. Namely the thinning out of the general anaesthetic, the patients arriving back into the world on a foreign, tidal pull. They would remember nothing of the interaction afterwards.
    
    As the patient’s eyelids bobbed, the eyeballs searching underneath the delicate skin, Dr Duncan stood beside her and waited. The patient’s hair was short, curly, shaved beside the ears. As she opened her eyes Dr Duncan could see the surgery’s effect, her pupils lost to its heavy weather. Sure enough the patient began to sob silently, to reject the tube in her throat. Her hand, the cannula tugging in her forearm, moved to find Dr Duncan, who squeezed her palm.
    
    It’s all fine, everything is fine, it went very well indeed.
    
    The patient nodded. Fell back to sleep.
    
    Another mother – was it her own? – said to her that you knew a child’s body best in illness. It was true enough. When he was six, Alex had two bouts of pneumonia. In bed for a month, then more. She intuited when he was lying on his back from the distant wheeze in his exhale. If he was lying on his front, the note would shift into a whistle. A long, boneless breath meant he could not easily be woken, that his fever remained at a peak. She could recall the scatter of his room, toys boxed in by other toys, arranged in concentric audiences, just as he’d left them before he was ill. She never tidied them away. The bears watched the toy soldiers who watched the race cars who watched the marbles. There was the pretty way Alex looked at her, too, eyes glassy, his hair spread neat and still against the pillow. As an adult he claimed not to remember any of it. She’d tried to prompt him. Mentioned the splendid delirium of his dreams. That when she’d soothed him he’d press into her neck and offer solitary, wandering words. Rhubarb, otter, flute. He’d only shake his head. Sorry, guess I was pretty out of it! Key, grass, hat.
    
    Ian watched Dr Duncan reassure the patient. The way he leaned into the door frame, his hip tilted, arms folded, indicated that it was she, Dr Duncan, who might have something to learn. To leave the room she had to walk right up to him, see his arms fall back to his sides, palms wiped briefly on his thighs. He moved with her into the corridor. An urgency in his proximity. He spoke too close to her ear.
    
    That all went smoothly, didn’t it?
    
    What do you think?
    
    Her authority was lessened, she felt, by the way her shoes squeaked against the pale green linoleum. She did not want his apology. It was building in him, she could feel it, that terrible crescendo. Twice he inhaled deeply. Twice he released the sigh through his nose, sounding all the dramatic tones of a poorly played instrument. Nothing had to be acknowledged. In this, the aftermath, they ought to dim the bathroom’s unforgiving brightness, let the scene, the slow movement of his hand, recede into whatever darkness. Time would take care of things. When it came to the next appendectomy she would likely let him make the first cut.
    
    She kept on walking, though was no longer sure where she should walk to. She was concerned Ian might place his hand on her shoulder. He kept pace, watching his feet, or listening to hers.
    
    The first or second day of his residency she found Ian’s eyes washed up on her collarbone. He watched the movement of her two necklaces, how they’d entwined, seeking out the disc the size of a thumbprint, St Christopher hunched over and on his sanctified way. Later, when she’d removed her jewellery for a gallbladder procedure, Ian had watched again, this time following her fingers as she’d worked the two clasps, then dropped the necklaces into the small dish.
    
    Was there anything else?
    
    No, no. Ian retreated.
    
    Dr Duncan slipped into a nurses’ station. Brewed a coffee. Ran through the meals she had made Alex on his last visit. On the final night she’d cooked a chicken chasseur, a dish she’d recently learned. It had never occurred to her to take apart a whole chicken, to lever the knife through the joints, slide out the breasts. Alex wandered into the kitchen. Mum, Jesus, that’s a bit intense. Still, he’d stood and watched, impressed, unable to fight his own fascination. Once she finished the job, her hands washed, she turned to face him. He was holding his breath tightly. It was a child’s habit, the lesson learned early on, an attempt to pause fear, to force the chest steady. Between them was an anticipatory silence, the rock before it hits the water. She waited. He certified some unknown feature of her gaze. Said absolutely nothing where there was something. He gave up their moment quickly, breaking it with a yawn, a faux stretch. He pointed at her new and enormous knife. Fucking hell, so when did you buy that?
    
    She checked the clock above the sink. The surgery had been faster than scheduled. Alex would be at the airport waiting to board. He did like to send a message, to let her know that it was all on time, add the crossed-fingers emoji, sometimes a blue heart. The university was not so far away. If he’d learned to drive then he could have covered the distance by car. But he’d shown no interest, none of the usual boyish and chaotic excitement that she had seen in his schoolmates. When she’d pushed, explained that it wasn’t so hard, that he should really get on with it, his lack of interest had become a kind of protest.
    
    Dr Duncan had taken the next day off. She would not be around to, if all went well overnight, discharge the patient herself. She wanted some time with Alex. Had not told him though, it occurred to her now, and he might have made other plans. There were still a couple of school friends that hadn’t yet gone to university, working instead, saving money to travel. There was a moment when Alex might have done the same. A couple of years ago he kept a world map preciously on his bedroom wall. Made his own key, a star for where he definitely wanted to go, a circle for a maybe. Dotted lines showed flight paths, a few costs had even been labelled. But then his plan had changed with no explanation, the whole map ripped down. Not thrown away, she’d noticed, but folded and slid underneath his bed.
    
    She decided on a lasagne. An old dish, the kind of thing she’d batch-cooked when Alex was still a pre-teen, enjoyed a little fame for it, his friends requesting it when they came to stay. They could eat it tomorrow night. She’d already ordered some decent red wine online, planned to put his palate to the test, and he’d roll his eyes but be quietly pleased.
    
    Her office was small and virtually pointless. She was almost never in it. But she took a moment now to check her phone. Sipped her coffee. Yes, Alex had sent two messages, All on time! Followed by his blue heart. She replied with a thumbs up. She ought to write a shopping list, knew the way her mind could slip once she left the hospital.
    
    A gentle knocking. Ian spoke into the crack in the door, not showing his face.
    
    Do you have a minute?
    
    Exactly one.
    
    So it would have to happen, this apology. He did not enter the room immediately. She imagined he rehearsed his lines again, a phraseology second-guessed and adjusted.
    
    Are you coming in?
    
    He closed the door gently. Please, she wanted to scream, dear God, don’t create an atmosphere. The office was ugly. There were no paintings on the walls, not a photo in sight.
    
    How can I help?
    
    I just wanted to say that before, he cleared his throat, with what happened before, I don’t want you to get the wrong idea, those photos, they were just for my boyfriend, that’s all, it’s just a bit of fun.
    
    There was a benefit, at least, to being the bearer of forgiveness. In the long beat of an apology, there is a luxury of seconds, a surplus, permission to really look at a person. The expert melancholia in his eyes. His skin very clear, his nails very short, a nice shape. A scar, like a white comma, across the knuckle of his pinky finger.
    
    Please. She held up her hand. It’s fine, like I said before, I shouldn’t have been in the men’s. She leaned forward for effect. I should say though, while we’re here, that it’s just important to be professional. That’s all I ask, for you to conduct yourself in a certain way. Don’t get upset, it’s just part of the job, an easy part if you’d just let it be easy.
    
    He sucked in his cheeks.
    
    I do, I do see.
    
    Good, that’s all I ask.
    
    She pretended to dial a number. Nodded. Waved him back out of the door.
    
    Dr Duncan wondered if it was true, whether Ian really had sent the picture to his boyfriend, if he even had only one boyfriend. And whoever it was for, what was understood about the image, then, once it was received, once it had left the hospital’s apparently irresistible space and travelled elsewhere, into a different room, a different building entirely. The body translated and re-translated, then well used by somebody else. It was a favour, she guessed, that would have to be returned. Ian had held the phone above his head so carefully, lifted his chin precisely to the right, left room for the flat of his stomach, the bulge of his crotch, the landscape of his fist visible through the thin cotton. She could’ve counted the knuckles.
    
    Dr Duncan and Ian were not close, but at fifty-seven, her gender, the fact she was a woman surgeon, had meant interest in her life where there had been none before. It was a temperamental currency but she was happy to engage, to say yes when invited to speak, to nod in empathetic agreement that it must have been terribly hard.
    
    Ian’s fixation was Dr Duncan’s time in Strasbourg. She told him she’d been the only woman studying and specialising in laparoscopic procedures at the university there, although it wasn’t the truth. There had been at least two, no, three other women she could remember. She recalled his wide expression, her fingers on her St Christopher pendant as he listened, asked questions. The conversation had delighted him. He wanted to travel, he spoke to the history of laparoscopy, pointed out the obvious, that it was not one man that had invented, or even pioneered the concept, but a series of separate nineteenth-century surgeons who had all landed on the same thought, across different continents. When Ian said ‘man’ he added air quotations, not to doubt their maleness, she gathered, but to acknowledge the deficit. It was always the daring predictability of the human body that enamoured him, he’d added, wanting to impress her, that these ‘men’ would individually come to the same conclusion, that the appendix would be found at the end of the large intestine. Yes, she’d agreed. Suspended as a lone piece of grammar. He’d liked that.
    
    When it came to words, her ex-husband had been no good. Every thought of him she resisted, the eye of her memory half shut. There was one that broke through with irritating regularity. A fight, only medium-sized, and him with a small towel wrapped around his thickened waist. The sentences that left his mouth. He stood damp and stupid in the corner of their old bedroom. Hence, he shouted. Thus, therefore, ergo. Periphrastic, she should have accused.
    
    There was nothing left to sign. Thankfully no new emergency admissions that needed her. Dr Duncan locked her office door. Normally, she’d throw on jeans, boots, leave on her clean scrub top. Maybe a jumper. But this time she wanted a gentle difference, to look a little less like his mother. Her mascara was clumpy, old and barely used, but she applied it in persuasive strokes. Lipstick on, then removed, it was too much. There was, as it turned out, a line. Hair down, brushed, she sprayed through dry shampoo and hated, really hated, the sweet smell. She went to switch out her jewellery and then stopped.
    
    She sat back at her desk. There really was nothing in the room to look at. She didn’t know if the other surgeons, those with offices, bothered with pictures. Perhaps an ailing plant. Ian had stood there and seen nothing else of her. Only a torso, her face and neck. The St Christopher, which he already knew.
    
    She took out her phone. Typed gay porn into the search bar. Chose the first website, with its promise of FREE and SKILLED MOUTHS. She scrolled down the page, each video on offer played briefly, the highlights, she supposed, as her thumb slid over the screen. One after another. Volume up, then down. SEXY STUDS squatted on a blue carpet. An open car door, a man bent over another man’s lap, a third man in the passenger seat. Denim was unbuttoned, hard cocks revealed. No underwear, she noted. There was a state of readiness. A kiss with an apocalyptic urgency. In an empty gym, they knelt, sucked, eyes not closed but opened. Moved like winners. She had expected something else but didn’t know what.
    
    In the women’s bathroom she pumped pink soap into her hands. She leaned closer to the mirror. Decided she looked nice, the mascara was worth it. But the lipstick had not been properly removed, caught in the cracks. She rubbed her mouth with the back of her hand.
    
    A few bits of paperwork to sign and then she could leave. She walked out of the hospital, unlocked her car and sat in the driver’s seat. She always took exactly a minute, hands placed on the wheel, without turning on the engine. It wasn’t a ritual so much as a reckoning with the world, the one that existed separately to the hospital’s surging and specific reality. It was the light. Tonight, her vision smoky with fatigue, it was a navy blue, full of shadows and gaps, almost everything reduced to its simplest shape. There was a time, during her first months as a general surgeon, when she found it hard to reconcile, to decide which was truer, the hospital or the rest, whatever came after. Now she knew it didn’t matter. It was only the light. Her retinas adjusting, contracting.
    
    Alex had taken a similar flight last time, landing late. Once again she would be picking him up after a long shift. When she was younger she’d woken up to the sound of traffic cones hitting her bumper, having briefly fallen asleep at the wheel. She didn’t sleep well. Alex had been an insomniac toddler, in need of company. He’d quietly enter their bedroom, wake her up by placing his cold hands on her cheeks. For a few years, too many years maybe, she’d made up a single mattress for him on the floor beside her.
    
    She started the engine. Would skip the supermarket for tonight. There’d be a chance to go first thing, before he was up, breakfast would be ready before he’d even realised she had gone.
    
    It was expensive to park at the airport and so she’d instructed him to wait by the kerb. She spotted him easily. His lovely shoulders in a nice shirt, a new jacket, both black and stylish. She saw, too, that he was talking to somebody, laughing into his phone. He spotted her seconds later, waving, hanging up as he did so. She did not ask, once he’d settled into the passenger seat, who it had been and he did not offer the information either. An ellipsis strung between them. A slight and shifting tension, elbow to elbow.
    
    She asked ordinary questions.
    
    How was the flight, had he eaten, what were his plans, how was his course, did he have enough money?
    
    He answered fully. Kept his phone in his pocket. She heard
    it vibrate.
    
    They picked up a pizza. He was tired, happy to eat in front of the TV. Later, when he’d fallen asleep on the sofa, she picked it up and tried to guess his passcode. Not his birthday, not her birthday. He slept on, his lips pursed, the way he looked as a child, his hands slid down his trackpants to grip his knees. It was a decision as obvious as her tattoo. Not a sense of ownership but an impulse, fragile, that deserved to be acted on. There was no futurity, what she expected to find, and then what she might feel as a consequence. She’d tried his father’s birthday, not that either. There had been no pets in the family, no short and beloved names she could try and translate into the numeric. He stirred, repositioned his body. She stood beside him. The phone glowed in her hand.
    
    Alex’s screen saver was a pile of small, pinkish shells on a wooden surface, either a dining table or a windowsill. The image was zoomed in, his fingers dragged across the screen to enlarge what he’d noticed. It meant nothing to her. A shaft of light fell across the centre of the pile, turning those shells pinker. She supposed Alex had found the moment beautiful, enough that he wanted to look at it every day, every few minutes, however often he lifted his phone to his face.
    
    As if she had caught its scent, Dr Duncan thought of the second house she had bought with her ex-husband. It had been her favourite. A purchase made on certain romantic whims. The complication of wisteria, untended for decades, across the arched, single-glazed windows. A large pond in the back garden, supposedly made by seventeenth-century monks, surrounded by rare varieties of self-seeded mint that had once been planted in a kind of holy herb garden. Out the back of the house, over a wall, was a field, also theirs. At the closest end was a large, grassy mound. A burial cairn, empty after raids over the ensuing centuries, of which they were now the official guardians.
    
    Alex, too, had loved that house. He’d just turned nine. Together they bullied her ex-husband into taking it on. He was put off by old buildings, thanks to childhood summers spent in a great aunt’s collapsing cottage, where he’d placed a Bible beneath his pillow, believing it would ward off any evil as he slept.
    
    Alex made a brief friend at his new school. A boy with a laugh that came out of nowhere, it made her jump, leaving such quiet in its wake. For a month or so the boy would come over every other day, staying for dinner, the pair of them obsessed with treasure. Thrilled to find a small blue apothecary bottle beneath a floorboard, a possible arrowhead in the garden. Their archive collected on a kitchen windowsill, where it had stayed, even after the friendship had ended. Together they kneeled over portions of earth and dug ferociously. Celebrating, high-fiving, grabbing each other’s shoulders over broken bits of clay pipe, shards of pottery, shapely stones.
    
    That summer, from her bedroom window, she watched them poised on the mound, the burial cairn, lying on their stomachs, positioning and repositioning their shattered objects. Alex took on the boy’s laugh, getting louder, and they then laughed into each other, heavily, sides colliding. Reached across lower backs to move things this way and that. There was a secret formula, a pattern they wanted to achieve. They liked, if it was the weekend and could wait out the dusk, to turn over onto their backs and lie underneath the fading orange sunset. And she’d let them. n"

    "text": "There are times when I think of cutting my hair, times when I think of cutting my throat, and other times when I think of screwing out my eyes. Forgive me, Doctor, it’s just a way to talk about myself, and about Armance.

    A sense of perplexity comes over me, I no longer know what to say; that is, in general, when one suddenly falls silent, thought wanders as though in expectation and then there it is – a novelty or a reflection.
    
    I start thinking about all this on the train – since I know the landscape by heart it’s not hard to do. I always travel first class, and always sit by the window. I could just about be permanently lost in thought, given the frequency of my displacements.
    
    I also have a habit of sitting on a rock by the river to read Stendhal or look at the river and the stones.
    
    I have absolutely no parents, no friends in particular, my life runs serenely, sweetly.
    
    A young woman has been living in my house for some time and I often meet acquaintances of hers to whom I offer drinks in my beautiful glasses. Miss Armance is very good company, she was born twenty years before me and wears her hair back, always neat. We met on the Milan–Gotthard–Zurich direttissimo train of the Swiss Federal Railways.
    
    She was sitting almost directly in front of me and one noticed her right away on account of that strict look she has at all times; now that I know it, I hardly notice it anymore, except on rare occasions; though there was a time when I couldn’t help going to her room at odd hours of the night, to see whether she might have let herself go a little (or not at all), to hear a story, or to be caressed.
    
    And she was so strict, so frightfully fierce. In the train compartment she had looked at me in such a mean way, and kept doing so. And so I took up my newspaper trick, I pretended to read, to look out the window in which her face was reflected, I smoked, blew my nose, picked up a book, looked up, and she was no longer there.
    
    Naturally I thought once again, with a sigh of relief, that I have too much imagination. I don’t think much of the very silly, even gullible, person that I am. But one starts to conjecture right away through the entire length of the Gotthard Tunnel – about ten minutes.
    
    She wears a kind of scarf I like very much – reddish, wide and comfortable – with a well-cut suit. Has it ever happened to you while on a train or a streetcar, or while riding a taxi, that you catch sight of someone you’d like to meet right away, just like that, or when you’re at a cafe, looking around, just so, I’d like to emphasize, for no particular reason?
    
    I remember once, on my way to Lindau, on the Bodensee, a thin tall man with gray eyes came into my compartment, I was a young girl on my way to school and was reading a book in French that I didn’t understand. The man started talking to me, asking whether I understood that book, and it struck me – how experienced he was.
    
    Then came the station, and I went back to school, crestfallen. Several years have gone by and I still think about it, like a wolf. I wouldn’t hide my desire to see him again (and to devour him).
    
    Often when I look at swallows in flight I wish I could fly: I love the sky, I look at the clouds and have no taste for extravagance. Lately I’d heard a girl ten years younger than me recount her dreams, about hens and metamorphoses. Not that the dreams of others particularly intrigue me, but I can become perplexed at the majesty of certain dreams I’ve never dreamed. As soon as Armance bid me goodnight, I would wait until she had fallen asleep to find out what might happen to her; I go into her room and watch; every now and then she moves her lips, or becomes agitated, I start to hum, finding it absurd to see one person asleep and another one standing there.
    
    I can never sleep in her bed, I absolutely detest getting tangled up.
    
    Armance starts telling her tale again. She is slipping into a sea of lizards and experiences a frightful tickling in her feet. I immediately feel pins and needles in my feet and I’m awake. Oh well. Could I ever understand my Armance?
    
    Out of coquetry, or a desire to compare, I look at myself in the mirror and I am decidedly determined to become more graceful, desirable, I spread sea-light pale blue eyeshadow on my lids and brush my hair a hundred times each day.
    
    I remember a dwarf playing in the sand in Camargue with a friend, I would have liked to have been an angel, to run after them, suffocate them, then turn into a mole.
    
    I detest Armance’s friends, I can’t stand them, I keep looking at my watch and they seem to never go away, and besides I’m not having a good time, and it seems ridiculous that I should have to wait for nightfall to have a conversation with her. I’m sure that in a few minutes she’ll smile at me simply because she is a bitch, and in one moment precisely everyone will smile at me; naturally I act as though nothing happened, maybe I’ve never been perfectly happy, but I know one shouldn’t be too patient.
    
    I don’t wish to put anyone on guard, but careful. Arousing is not allowed.
    
    Because then I can’t fall asleep. And what happens next is that since I am not sleeping I start thinking, scrutinizing my feelings, I go back to Armance, don’t say a word to her, adore her, go back to my room, drink a glass of milk and fall asleep again.
    
    I wake up in the morning and ask to be taken to the beach, it’s hot, I drink white wine and we’re especially cheerful. Everyone’s drinking, it’s like a picnic, we’re all friends, I no longer need to plot anything.
    
    How do I know whether I like the sea, how could I imagine that Armance can’t swim? And that all you need is a slip and you fall off a cliff ? Let’s rejoice.
    
    Go without taking offense, so that I might go back to sleep and watch over Armance as she sleeps.
    
    It’s raining, raining hard and I don’t think the weather will clear.
    
    . . . ‘The first thing is to understand whether a person’s openness might be a positive sign with respect to another person.’ This is a problem I have in love.
    
    Everyone has their moment. I don’t know what to do with this rainy afternoon. It gets the time it deserves.
    
    The calendar. There are many calendars in my house. Miss Armance has been living in the other room for months. Gazing at the calendars I see a kind of balance sheet, a summary, no way out. On the 3rd of June I could have hit her I was so furious. Categorically. It’s a good thing I make a note of everything, otherwise she’d be right all the time. I don’t have a comeback all lined up, and don’t immediately realize what is going on, I mean that all you’d need is a distraction and I just know that these so-called friends would become – what? Brothers, maybe something more, lovers perhaps, Armance my dear, and all the while I bite my nails.
    
    And today, a Tuesday, is another afternoon like the one before it. If they steal I devour, I’m alive and well, so why does Armance go on torturing me, and if she pretends to be as I want her, why doesn’t she take her so-called friends to tea at Babington’s or elsewhere, for instance? She’d come back at dusk more beautiful than ever.
    
    The calendar says that from November of last year to today I have spent only one afternoon at home. Brooding.
    
    My solitary afternoons, the movie theaters, the aimless taxi rides, what a nightmare when we won’t be allowed to smoke in taxis anymore, Armance, what will I do with my life then? And what of my afternoons?
    
    One afternoon I picked scented roses from a vine, with all their little green leaves, and the petals so pale blue blown in the breeze, which is what happens when I look at the sky, with tears in my eyes I put down my Rozenkrantz."

    "text": "Your girlfriend is some kind of sexual deviant, but it is not as much fun as you first thought.

    You’re that one lad in your year who grew about four inches between the last day of spring term and the first day of autumn term. Ever since, the girls at school can’t get enough of you. Again, you thought this would be more fun than it actually turned out to be.
    
    They come and sit next to you when you just want to eat your sandwiches in the courtyard in peace, listen to music and think about your favourite WWE wrestlers. Suddenly one of them will yank your earphone out and say through a mouthful of chewing gum, Watcha listening to, handsome? Or a girl will kiss you on one of your premature sideburns and you’ll be dimly aware of her saliva for the rest of the day. It’s nothing to do with you; they are just programmed to like tall men. Something to do with the caveman times, and who can slay the biggest wild pig. You’re starting to notice that everything in the world boils down to meat, blood and bones – evolution is all on the surface. The truth is, despite appearances, you’d rather be killed than kill. Your mate Dave said if you picked one of them to go out with, the rest might leave you alone.
    
    Your girlfriend isn’t like other girls, which is why you asked her to go out with you in the first place, when you freed her 20p from the vending machine in the dinner hall, and she turned her watery eyes towards you and looked at you like a brain-damaged bird. That’s what you thought of: a baby bird you’d once seen dying in a splat on the ground after presumably falling out of its nest. Huge, wet eyeballs, and its chest rising raggedly, up, down, up, down. You knew you should’ve done something but you left it there. It was a hot sunny day and some parts of it – the bones in its neck, the tips of its wings – were already drying out, turning plasticky. You figured it wouldn’t be long until nature took its course, or for somebody braver than you to come along and drop a brick on its head.
    
    In front of the vending machine, your future girlfriend held out her beaded purse. You dropped the silver coin in, and she zipped it closed and put it in her satchel without thanking you. Everyone at school carries a rucksack: Nike, Adidas, Rip Curl; decorated with pin badges and Tipp-Ex expletives. Yours is Animal and covered in cool S’s. She had a brown leather messenger that closed with a flap and a magnet. Not a spot of graffiti.
    
    Do you want to get some chips or something after school? You said it too quickly. It wasn’t like you to be shy. She just shrugged. Her expression hadn’t altered throughout the exchange, and you found that oddly charming. It was boring always knowing what people were thinking; it was annoying. You couldn’t imagine this girl chewing your ear off, laughing like a hyena, flirting with your mates. It was as if you’d discovered a new land or species, and now all you had to do was stick your flag in it before somebody else noticed. By rights you were out of her league, but you didn’t know until you saw her waiting under the cherry tree by the gates whether her shrug had meant yes or no. You guessed that gave her back some power.
    
    It was the unbranded chicken shop where everyone went on dates. It was the cheapest place in town. The strip lights flickered and the ketchup was watered down with vinegar. Sometimes the chicken was still frozen in the middle. You bought her chips and she surprised you by eating them very fast. You were too nervous to be hungry. Besides, it was a Thursday and you didn’t want to spoil your mum’s meatballs. You pushed your chips towards her, and she ate those too.
    
    I should warn you, she said, ketchup on her chin, on the back of her hand. I like to have sex a lot. It was the first proper thing she’d said to you. You slid some napkins over which she ignored. You asked her if she wanted ice cream, and she shrugged, which you were learning to take as consent. You bought her a strawberry dream: three shades of pink layered in a plastic vase.
    
    I like to do it in uncomfortable places, she said, cream running down her forearm.
    
    If there’s a patch of slimy mud or some coarse gravel or some freshly fallen snow, and nobody’s around, your girlfriend is going to take off her panties and lie in it. Her skin is like British Museum marble, and she’s got this incredibly pink pussy that always looks sore. You were fascinated by it at first, but now watching yourself go in and out of it turns your stomach, like seeing a shoe rub a blister.
    
    Your girlfriend has long red hair and maybe this is why you thought she was attractive. Red hair is like a trick played on lads’ minds. Sometimes you wonder if she’d be pretty at all if she shaved her head. The hair on her pussy is ginger and her eyelashes are very pale. If you asked her to shave her head she would. Her obedience frightens you, and you’re increasingly careful not to ask for anything.
    
    At first, doing it with her was satisfying, if a little strange. Lately, she’s not letting you finish. It’s like she reaches a point of maximum discomfort, and therefore satisfaction, and then gets up and starts getting dressed, leaving you there flailing. Come on, she says. And you follow her home with it tucked into your waistband, waiting for the moment you can lock yourself in your parents’ downstairs loo and finish the job over the bowl. Your girlfriend is turning you into a deviant, and it isn’t even your fault.
    
    All you really want to do is fuck her in a bed. Take your time; look at her instead of over your shoulder. Catch your breath and decide if you even like her. She lives in a caravan with her step-dad: in her bedroom with the door closed and music playing, you can still hear her dad opening lagers in the lounge and coughing. Your parents are religious, which means when your girlfriend is over you have to leave the door wide open. You have had sex with your girlfriend 114 times so far, and not once did you have it in your own bed. Not once did you feel safe and unhurried.
    
    I’m getting into strangulation, she tells you one afternoon over chips. Her ceaseless list of fetishes distracts from the distracted way you have to be with her. Your time together is always just beginning or about to end. I like the feeling that at any moment I might die, she says. Here, you try. She stretches over the table and blindsides you by putting her hands around your neck. She is stronger than she looks, much stronger. You choke and make a girlish sound. You can feel half-chewed chips climbing your oesophagus. You knock over your Coke, panicking. The family in the next booth are craning. With your larger hands you snatch at her bony fingers.
    
    You should’ve said if you didn’t like it, she says.
    
    She has retracted back to her side of the booth, and slumps over her chips. Your crotch is soaked with Coke; you know you should be angry but you’re not. She chews with her mouth open, not taking her eyes off you; walks her fingers up to your cup of barbeque sauce.
    
     
    
    One of the things your mother says is to always have a plan. You plan to build a bed of nails and fuck your girlfriend on it. Your girlfriend doesn’t make you happy, exactly, and you have very little in common. She isn’t interested in wrestling. But lately you’ve spent so much time together it’s getting difficult to remember what you did before. There’s an intensity to the way you are with her that you’re afraid you won’t find anywhere else – something between fear and protectiveness; excitement and shame. Perhaps your bed of nails will cure her deviancy, like Miss Jameson says prayer will cure the homos. It will be a grand gesture designed to bring you closer. You’ll tend her wounds. You’ll find a different way to be with one another. Perhaps she’ll swear chastity and you’ll gallantly join her, pretending to mind, secretly not minding. You’re tired of feeling dirty. The lads at school buy their girlfriends miniature teddy bears with plush red hearts over their bellies. The same lads call the girls sluts and make them cry on purpose. The girls attach the teddy bears to the zippers of their school bags, like proof of something. The only thing you can be sure of is that cuddly toys aren’t reflective of whatever it is you have with your girlfriend. You’ll make a bed of nails, because your girlfriend proclaims to love pain, and it’s about time you gave her something real.
    
    Miss Allingham-Mills is excited by your bed of nails proposal and says not enough young people are interested in meditation these days. She wants you to make a Design Folder charting your project from conception to completion, highlighting any pitfalls along the way and offering suggestions on how they could be avoided if you were to undertake the project a second time. You say you only want to make a bed of nails, not go on and on about making it. She wishes you luck in finding another fully stocked workshop. You make the folder.
    
    Your girlfriend comes to watch you work at lunchtimes and after school. One evening, walking her home across the fields, you find a rabbit lying on its side under a hedgerow. Its eyes are swollen to double the normal size. Flies hover. You think it’s dead, then one of its legs starts to jerk. Ergh, you say. Come on. She shakes your hand off. It’s mixy, she says. We have to find a rock. You look around until you find a big enough rock and she says, Ready? You say yes, but soon realise you can’t do it. Fine, she says. She takes the rock and you turn your back. You will never forget the sound.
    
    It turns out that a bed of nails is a very easy thing to make. You could probably have done it in a day or two, if you didn’t have to do it around your other lessons. After a week, the nails are in place, though they are all wobbly in their holes. You need to put more screws in to get some pressure, says your girlfriend, swinging her legs from one of the work benches. You tell her you know that already. Just fill in the folder, you say. What do you want me to write? she says. Anything, you say.
    
    Miss Allingham-Mills tests the tension in the nails by pinging them at random with her fingers. They make a twanging sound. Nice finish, she says, stroking its smooth edges. How about showing it in assembly? She asks to see your folder and your girlfriend hands it over. Miss Allingham-Mills flicks through it, nodding and hmm-hemming, apparently satisfied.
    
    The night you finish it, you have a dream that an animal is sitting on your chest – its breath is sweet and rank like junk food. You wake up fighting for breath, your heart hammering, and realise you have orgasmed in your sleep.
    
     
    
    A bed of nails isn’t especially heavy but it is an awkward thing to carry. You didn’t think this far ahead. You ask Dave to help you carry it along the old tramway to the bridge where you’ve been a couple of times already with your girlfriend. He says he will do it for a Mars bar and a look at your girlfriend’s tits. You ask her and she shrugs. You buy a Mars bar from the vending machine where you first met her. Dog walkers pretend not to stare as you and Dave pass with the bed of nails. You have secured two leather straps to help carry it. Walking behind, your girlfriend pets the dogs. At no point does she offer to help.
    
    The path continues over the bridge, while a smaller track forks off, leading to the water. You tell Dave it’s just down this way. He insists you are the one to walk backwards down the slippery mud. As you’re the one getting laid, he says. Fair enough, you say. You huff and skid and swear, tread carefully as you can. You focus on your girlfriend waiting on the main path to try to incentivise yourself. You do not feel remotely horny.
    
    Timber! says Dave, and the bed of nails smacks into the mud under the bridge, splattering you both. There is graffiti on the domed ceiling. There is some white dog shit in the far corner. This is the closest you’ve ever got to fucking your girlfriend indoors. Go on, then, says Dave. And you give him the Mars bar. And the rest, he says. You call your girlfriend down and a moment later she appears, with the light and the water behind her. Her hair burns like sodium in the last of the day’s sun.
    
    Go on, says Dave.
    
    Your girlfriend looks at you. You shrug.
    
    She turns her face to the side and down, as though something in the mud of the riverbank has caught her eye, and lifts up her T-shirt and fleece in one.
    
     
    
    It is less than an hour later and you and Dave are walking back along the old tramway and both of your backs are bleeding, 200 tiny holes. Dave takes out his Mars bar and opens the wrapper, and drops the wrapper on the ground. You walk in silence. Everything hurts. You put your hand up your sweater and wince when you feel the damage. Your hand comes away bloody. A dog walker passes, going in the direction of the bridge and says, Good evening. You both say, Good evening. And then your friend takes a ragged sob.
    
    Do you want this, Dave says. You tell him you don’t especially like Mars bars, but you’ll have it if it’s going free. Have it, he says, and gives it to you. When you reach the car park, you feel sick. All you can taste is chocolate. All you can feel is a wet, unhygienic pain.
    
    I’m going this way, says Dave. Though of course you know where he lives.
    
     
    
    You’re not really sure how it happened but your girlfriend told you to lie on the bed of nails and you found you wanted to. What’s my name, she said, pulling your jeans off while Dave stood frozen against the wall, a smirk dying on his lips. Elenore, you said. What’s my fucking name, she said. Elenore! A dozen birds erupted from a nearby blackthorn. Say my name say my say it say it. Elenore! You were crying. Elenore! You were bleeding. Elenore, Elenore. You were so in love.
    
     
    
    You look back at where Dave has disappeared. He broke much sooner than you, and you hope he’s okay, though if you’re honest, you don’t care very much. He didn’t have to be such a pussy. You had planned on walking home yourself. Everything is suddenly so new, so confusing. You thought you needed to be alone for a while. To look at yourself long and hard in the bathroom mirror. But you surprise yourself by turning around. Hello again, says the same dog walker from earlier, returning to her car. A bag of shit swings merrily from her belt. The dog is leashed now, so close to the road.
    
    I left something, you tell her.
    
    You’d better run, says the dog walker. It’ll be pitch dark soon enough."

    "text": "Hal had a bad shoulder. Danna had no patience for it. She felt Hal was selective about what the shoulder could take. They could fuck in whatever position, he could carry her bags at the airport, but if Danna wanted to book a duo Pilates session ever, Hal was in agony. He often said it like that: I’m in agony. Hal and Danna were sitting on a restaurant patio, eating cheeses. Hal had the ball game up on his phone. In the morning, they’d leave on a short vacation in celebration of Danna’s birthday; the night before a vacation, they never ate
    at home.
    
    Hal was moving his right shoulder in circles: forward, backward, forward. When he did his shoulder exercises his face always became vacant, upsettingly so.
    
    ‘Who’s winning?’ Danna asked.
    
    ‘Not us,’ said Hal. He rolled his shoulder harder. ‘Jesus Christ,’ he said. ‘Fuck.’ He made a disgusting noise of relief and rubbed his right shoulder with his left hand.
    
    Hal had no shame about pain. He’d grown up loved. Danna had been loved too, but by parents who were doctors. There’d been no room for pain in Danna’s house; her parents were amputating feet and resecting bowels. The only person who’d ever cared to hear about Danna’s pain was Hal. It was what made her love him right away: how seriously he took everything about her. When Danna had a headache Hal brought out his special headache hat, an ice pack in the shape of a crown. When Danna had strep, Hal shone a flashlight in her mouth to look at her tonsils twice a day and gave her creative descriptions of how they looked. The left one looks like a striped candy. The right one looks like a blobfish.
    
    Hal held his silverware in the European style because his mother had grown up holding it that way. He could flex his butt cheeks independently of one another, on command. He’d published a chapbook straight out of grad school about an empty field and time passing and dedicated it to Danna. Danna had intrusive thoughts sometimes about Hal getting crushed by the train or stabbed by a bum on the train or stabbed by Danna herself in the middle of the night while she sleepwalked, which she’d never done, but which she always feared she might spontaneously start doing. The thoughts made her very sad most of the time. But sometimes when she had them she didn’t feel anything at all, and she wondered what she’d feel if Hal died for real. Sometimes she thought nothing. She wondered if that meant she didn’t love him. She wondered if that meant she shouldn’t marry him. She wondered if anyone should marry anyone. She wondered if she’d have these thoughts if she were marrying someone very rich. She wondered if she’d have these thoughts if she were marrying someone who wasn’t very rich but who wasn’t Hal. Eight years in, Hal felt like another her, somehow. She knew his body better than her own, she loved how silky he was, she could tell by the hitch of his voice exactly what he was thinking and exactly why he was thinking it, she could watch him struggle with a jar and know whether he would be able to get it open, she could tell by the way he headed toward the bathroom whether he was going in to shit or trim his nails, she could tell from how he looked at his phone who he was texting. She could trace his behaviors and failures and strengths to the behaviors and failures and strengths of his parents and of his brothers. She could make the worst and thickest noise when she orgasmed and feel safe in the certainty he’d love it. When he couldn’t penetrate her, which was often, because Danna had a tight pelvic floor, she knew exactly the sorts of phrases to whisper in his ear while he jerked himself off with one hand and cupped his own balls with the other, the order to say them in, which ones to repeat, which one to save for last, which one would make Hal get that sad look in his eyes that meant he was about to bust. She felt liable for him. She had the capacity to hate him. She had the need to manage him, protect him. She and Hal cared for each other. They popped each other’s pimples. They fingered one another’s assholes. They did each other’s dishes. And so, they’d recently decided, they would become engaged to be married at the end of the summer.
    
    Danna’s great dream was to commit double suicide with Hal at sixty-five so that neither of them would ever have to endure the humiliations of old age. Danna’s mother had had a pair of patients who’d done just that about five years ago, walking into a canal together with rocks in their pockets. They were elderly communists and they’d had enough. When Danna imagined herself and Hal as old communists who’d had enough, walking together into death, it felt realer to her than the present. For this reason Danna wondered if maybe what she really wanted was just to die.
    
    Now Danna’s mother was texting. Have fun. I am very happy for you.
    
    Danna blinked at the text. ‘Um,’ she said out loud, ‘why does my mom think we’re getting engaged this weekend?’
    
    Hal didn’t answer her. He had his hand over his mouth: that meant Brandon Marsh was at bat. Danna knew better than to press him. She went on the website of the jeweler who was making her ring and looked at the piece that would be ready for her in nine to twelve weeks: sometime in August. It was a gold band, channel-set with small squares of lapis lazuli. It wasn’t one of a kind. Probably several other girls had it. Danna hoped that in a year she’d still think it was chic. It was what Hal could afford. Danna had never dreamed of an engagement ring; she’d dreamed of being someone’s favorite. The ring proved that she was Hal’s.
    
    ‘Because we leave tomorrow? Or because they’re fascists,’ Hal said, after a time. ‘Fascists without a dream in their heart.’ Danna ignored it when Hal deployed these kinds of non sequiturs; they were an affectation he’d shaped for the purpose of getting attention from his father – a radical who hated children, a deadly serious writer of dense, unpopular novels. Hal had had to say things like They’re fascists, fascists without a dream in their heart from the time he was a child, probably, just to get his father’s head out of the London Review of Books. To Danna, understanding the roots of someone’s tics or pains better than they understood them themselves was the purest love could get.
    
    ‘Ah,’ said Hal. Marsh was out. Danna handed him a piece of cheese and he ate it without looking at her.
    
    ‘It’s just ball,’ they said at the same time; it was what they said when something was wrong.
    
     
    
    Hal drove. Danna texted and listened to lo-fi beats and watched Instagram stories and checked the weather and looked at photos from May 2018 and November 2017 and searched StreetEasy for one-bedrooms under $3,500 in Fort Greene Park Slope Crown Heights Prospect Heights Gowanus Williamsburg Greenpoint Carroll Gardens Columbia Waterfront District Brooklyn Heights Clinton Hill Windsor Terrace Prospect Lefferts Gardens and checked the stock market and opened TikTok and watched a TikTok of a dog licking a baby’s head and one of a woman talking about being diagnosed with stage four cancer while pregnant and one of a woman showing off her collection of Chanel ballet flats and one of a man adding jam to yogurt to make a high-protein dessert and one of a baby allegedly seeing a ghost and one of a nonbinary relationship advice expert who was saying that the thing women are looking for in a relationship is a man who will fight for them and then Danna closed TikTok and took a picture of the highway and uploaded it to Close Friends and checked Slack and looked on Depop and read all of the notes in her notes app and googled can you buy car over 100k miles reddit and opened Maps and zoomed all the way out and scrolled to Russia and zoomed in on parts of Russia and thought about vastness and Stalingrad and goats by the roadside and coldness and fur hats and how society had been constructed and how race had been constructed and how borders had been constructed and about one of her beautiful acting-school classmates from Kyrgyzstan and about visiting Kyrgyzstan, and then she googled visit kyrgistan american legal and americans visit tibet legal and paused the music and opened TikTok once more and watched a TikTok of a Tibetan girl that popped up first thing and a video of a Kyrgyz girl that popped up second thing, which made her think about her Kyrgyz classmate’s eating disorder, which made her think about her own eating disorder, and her mother’s eating disorder, at which point she began to feel huge in her body, so she went back to looking at apartments and requested a tour of an apartment on Lincoln Place for Tuesday, when they’d be back, and then she rested her head against the window, breathed in heavily twice, thought hazily about the Lincoln Place apartment’s wide wood floorboards – so much wider than the floorboards in their current place – and fell asleep to the dream of them.
    
    ‘Danna,’ Hal said in his emergency voice, ‘Danna,’ rousing her.
    
    Her stomach squeezed in on itself. Her arms went numb. She braced for whatever.
    
    ‘Am I getting off here,’ Hal asked, frantic, ‘or am I going straight?’
    
    ‘I’m asleep,’ Danna said. Her ears hurt. Her big headphones were still on. She lifted the right earpad and placed it behind her right ear. She looked through the windshield. They were veering right, toward the exit. ‘I don’t know, I don’t know, I think –’
    
    ‘Fuck,’ Hal said, whipping his neck left. ‘Fuck.’ He pulled the wheel hard. Then they were on the grassy triangle between the exit and the highway.
    
    ‘Ahh,’ Danna said. ‘Jesus fuck.’
    
    They were stopped just in front of a murder of sturdy orange barricades, little cylinders bunched together like kindergarteners. The car lilted to the left. They were upstate-ish; there were hills.
    
    ‘Fuck,’ Hal said again, and tried to merge back on to the road.
    
    ‘Stop,’ Danna said, ‘stop, is the car okay?’ It was a rental; she had a sudden vision of being taken to court and squeezed for everything she had.
    
    ‘Nothing happened,’ Hal said. ‘We’re just on this part.’
    
    ‘Something happened,’ Danna said. ‘You’re not on the road.’
    
    ‘This is the road,’ Hal said.
    
    ‘It’s not the road,’ Danna said. ‘It’s the triangle. Stop. Stop moving. Put it in park. Put it in park.’
    
    Hal wouldn’t put the car in park. Danna pulled up on the emergency brake.
    
    ‘You’re, like, freaking out,’ Hal said, shifting furiously into park.
    
    ‘You drove off the road,’ Danna said.
    
    ‘Because I didn’t know where to go. You were supposed to be on Maps.’
    
    ‘Stop gaslighting me,’ Danna said. ‘This is serious.’
    
    ‘This isn’t serious. I just need to know which way.’
    
    Suddenly Danna’s head was vibrating. Her fancy German headphones were letting her know she was getting a call. ‘Mommy,’ said the lady who was the automated voice of Danna’s headphones. ‘Mommy.’ This was what the headphones said when Danna’s mother was calling. Danna declined the call.
    
    ‘Hold on,’ she said to Hal. She looked at Maps. ‘It says go straight.’ Danna looked up and ahead. ‘It’s a toll road here.’
    
    ‘I know,’ Hal said. ‘Which is why I got confused. We didn’t rent the – the thing, the whatever –’
    
    ‘What thing –’
    
    ‘The pass, the special pass that beeps. For tolls.’
    
    ‘They can bill by plate,’ Danna said. ‘There’s a whole bill-by-plate lane,’ she said, pointing to it, ‘right there.’
    
    Hal followed her point, but he was making the face he made when he didn’t want to have things clarified or simplified, when he wanted to be confused, when he wanted to shame Danna with his confusion. ‘Where?’ he asked, squinting.
    
    ‘The – the far lane, there,’ Danna said. She pointed harder.
    
    ‘Fine,’ Hal said, pissed. He looked over his shoulder, disengaged the emergency brake and put the car in drive. He hung a hard left and floored the gas. The car rocketed across all four lanes. Lots of people honked.
    
    ‘HAL,’ said Danna, grabbing at the wheel, yanking it toward her, stopping Hal from smashing into one of the toll booths. Hal braked. A worker inside looked up like: Whoa.
    
    ‘Do you need to get out?’ Danna asked. ‘Do you need to get out and let me drive?’
    
    ‘I’m a good driver,’ Hal said.
    
    ‘So why is this happening, why are we doing this? You need to calm the fuck down. Take a fucking breath, dude.’
    
    ‘Don’t call me dude,’ Hal said. ‘I hate it when you call me dude.’ He took a breath. Hal was good at parallel parking and little else when it came to cars.
    
    ‘Let’s switch,’ Danna said, unbuckling. ‘We need to switch for a little.’
    
    ‘There’s cars,’ Hal said.
    
    ‘We need to switch,’ Danna said, and they did. Then she guided them through the toll booth and onward, toward the place they were paying money to visit.
    
     
    
    The resort was not as nice as it had seemed online. Nothing ever was. Danna should’ve known better than to expect real comfort; she’d first seen it on TikTok. There was a small woodstove in the cabin, a laminated card on a table nearby that said i work. Danna dreamed for a second that later they’d gather some firewood together and get cozy, maybe trade lazy oral on the floor before it.
    
    ‘Fuck, my eyes,’ Hal said, taking off his glasses to paw at his lids. ‘They’re so dry.’
    
    Danna’s phone buzzed. Giada – her oldest, simplest friend.
    
    I SAW STORIES
    ARE YOU THERE NOW
    RING PIC IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS IT HAPPENS IM DEADASS
    IS THERE CHAMPS IN ROOM
    OR FRUIT
    ?????????
    
    There were some photogenic mandarins, stems attached, on a low table near the woodstove – Danna squeezed them, testing for realness.
    
    Hal looked at the mandarins. ‘Aww,’ he said. ‘I love when they have the stems.’ He took a picture of Danna’s hand around the fruit, and Danna could tell by the way he moved his thumbs that he was tagging and posting.
    
    thers fruit, she wrote Giada, but its complimentary
    like he didn’t put it there
    ***theres
    
    ‘You didn’t order these, right?’ she asked Hal, double-checking.
    
    Hal made a face that indicated he hadn’t. Danna’s ribs crackled; she felt rageful, out of nowhere. She never would’ve thought to want special hotel fruit. But now that there was fruit, and not because of Hal but because it was always here for everyone, she felt unspecial.
    
    Giada texted a screenshot of Hal’s story of the mandarins, then three messages:
    
    IS HE PROPOSING OR DID HE JUST TAKE U TO THE CATSKILLS FOR BDAY
    IS HE PROPOSING OR DID HE JUST ORDER THE MOST AESTHETIC FRUIT FOR U
    BLEEEEEEBS
    
    Bleebs was what Giada said when she was feeling excited.
    
    ‘Is the ring secretly ready?’ Danna asked Hal. ‘Do you, like: secretly have the ring right now?’
    
    Hal looked frightened. ‘No,’ he said. ‘You’re on the emails with them too. You’d know.’
    
    Danna had wanted a full-transparency proposal. No surprises. No pictures. She would not make the engagement face. She would not put her hands over her mouth. She and Hal would go to the store and pick up the ring, and they would walk to the waterfront, and he’d put it on her finger, and they’d walk home slowly, talking as they often did on walks about how much they loved one another, and nothing about their relationship would be different. But now Danna felt a lack.
    
    Hal could see it in her face, apparently. ‘Is your mom bugging you about this? Is your mom making you feel like you should be engaged to me already when she doesn’t even want you to be engaged to me? Like I’m a dick for not proposing on your birthday when you told me you didn’t want me to propose on your birthday? Because your birthday was about your birthday and our relationship was about our relationship?’
    
    ‘Stop shitting on my mom,’ Danna said. ‘It’s Giada.’
    
    ‘Stop texting with Giada.’
    
    ‘You’re being really scary today.’
    
    ‘Oh, my God,’ Hal said. He put his hands in his hair. ‘We need to, like: I don’t know, dude, hit reset.’
    
    ‘You can’t call me dude if I can’t call you dude.’
    
    ‘Oh, my –’
    
    ‘You got so mad at me for calling you dude in the car. Like, so mad.’
    
    ‘I wasn’t so mad. I’m not mad. I haven’t been mad. I’m never mad at you, because you are the light of my fucking life.’
    
    ‘Shut the fuck up,’ Danna said, feeling crushed by love.
    
    ‘Don’t say fuck just because I said fuck,’ Hal said.
    
    In minutes they were kissing. Sometimes they got their wires all – it was stupid. Why was it so hard for them to hear each other? Sometimes it felt like they’d never met before.
    
    ‘Do you sometimes feel like you’ve never met me before?’ she asked him, breaking the kiss. He tried not to let her. ‘Do you ever feel like we don’t know each other and we’re strangers?’
    
    ‘No,’ Hal said, so simple. ‘Do you?’
    
    ‘I don’t know,’ Danna said. ‘I think it’s the driving.’
    
    ‘I made one fucking mistake. Because you weren’t navigating. Because you fell asleep. And I’d never begrudge you sleep. But I asked you to navigate.’
    
    Danna knew Hal was right. Only babies could get away with falling asleep anywhere. ‘Two mistakes, right next to each other. Two bad mistakes.’
    
    ‘Nothing bad happened.’
    
    But she felt like something bad had happened, even though it was, to be fair, objectively true that nothing had. In moments like this one Danna felt like something was growing out of her brain. Like she’d never know a moment of surety, or quiet. The might’ves were always branching, branching, carrying ugly blooms: the fear of missing something obvious, the fear of everyone but Danna knowing some great truth about what her life really was.
    
     
    
    Early the next morning Danna dreamed that she was one of two finalists for a prestigious magazine job. Then the other finalist died and Danna got the job by default. She woke up feeling so boundless and powerful that she suggested a hike; there was a four-mile loop that started behind the resort, and though Danna was not an outdoorswoman, she’d inferred from the Instagrams of others that shared experiences in nature could deepen the connection between two people in an exponential way.
    
    ‘Great,’ said Hal, ‘lemme shower.’
    
    ‘But we’re going on a hike,’ Danna said.
    
    Hal looked around as if at an audience. ‘So I can’t shower?’
    
    ‘No, it’s just: why would you? If you’re gonna get sweaty?’
    
    ‘I don’t get that sweaty walking,’ said Hal. ‘That’s you.’
    
    While Hal showered, Danna dressed and applied SPF to her face, her vulva already sweating through her lululemon tights. ‘You’re making it so hot in here,’ she screamed through the frosted glass of the sliding door to the bathroom, but Hal didn’t respond. He emerged from the bathroom as he always did after a shower, fully dressed; Danna was dismayed to find that he was wearing chinos and a button-down. ‘We’re going on a hike,’ she said.
    
    ‘I didn’t bring hike clothes,’ said Hal.
    
    ‘We’re dressed for totally different things.’
    
    ‘So?’
    
    ‘So I want it to be an athletic walk.’
    
    ‘It’ll be an athletic walk.’
    
    ‘I want to get sweaty, though.’
    
    Hal looked at her.
    
    ‘And when we’re dressed differently for the same thing it makes us both look retarded in completely different ways. Like: when I’m dressing for an athletic walk and you’re dressing for a casual walk, it’s like I’m alone in the pursuit of an athletic walk, and it’s like you don’t really want to be on the walk with me in the way I want to be on the walk.’
    
    ‘I want to be on the walk,’ Hal said. ‘In whatever way you want to be on a walk. I literally forgot the clothes. I wish I could be in the right clothes. I’m sorry.’
    
    ‘Thank you,’ Danna said.
    
    ‘But don’t say retarded, Danna,’ Hal said. ‘It doesn’t make you sound cool.’
    
    The hike was simple and beautiful, but Hal seemed to have decided that he wanted to use it to make a point to Danna about her self-absorption. Each time they passed anyone on the trail, a few minutes later Hal would go, ‘Do you remember what they were wearing?’ and Danna would have to admit she didn’t and Hal would poke her shoulder and Danna would tell him to fuck off. Things grew tense and, at a certain point, when they heard someone around the next bend, Danna looked at Hal and said, ‘Don’t you fucking dare ask me what they’re wearing,’ but when the path straightened out on the far side of a deep curve there weren’t people there at all. A mother bear with three cubs was crossing the trail many yards ahead of them, one cub swiftly climbing into the brush on the trail’s western side while the other two stopped in the middle to play, like dogs, pawing and biting. The mother bear turned her head. Danna made eye contact with her, and she felt the quality and the length of their eye contact to be profound. Then the bear turned back to her cubs, urging them along. The babies walked into the yellowing brush, and their mother followed behind.
    
    Hal smiled at Danna and squeezed her hand. He didn’t say a word, and neither did she. They walked forward: cautious, linked, studying the animals’ prints in the dirt.
    
    After the bears, Danna started noticing the smells around her more intensely, and Hal started periodically going ‘Ah, Jesus’, and reaching up beneath his sunglasses to wipe tears from his eyes, and both of them became more vocal about pointing out flowers and leaves they liked to one another.
    
    At the rough midpoint of the loop they stopped to sit on some large rocks and kiss and look at their phones and share some water from Hal’s water bottle, and Danna thought about what a perfect moment it would be for the moment of their engagement. Upon sitting down, Danna had pulled an expensive oversized sweater of real wool over her head to cut the chill in the air. Now, she felt thin and glamorous in the lazy way belonging to mid-errand celebrities. Once she’d seen Dakota Fanning in the old Chelsea Bed Bath & Beyond wearing an amazing plaid tunic, her hair silky and undone. Danna felt like that now, and it made her want to be seen and coveted and claimed. It was a pure, succulent moment, and she wasn’t prepared for it.
    
    She was furious with herself for abandoning belief in life’s rarity and insisting on having everything out in the open, within her control; for having rejected such a distinct milestone of the female experience, such an ancient love ritual, in demanding no surprises. She became hateful of herself and deeply crabby, and because she’d taken a ten-milligram weed gummy right before the hike, her crabbiness pursued itself inward toward no terminus she could see.
    
    ‘Did you take a video of the bears?’ Danna asked Hal, knowing he hadn’t.
    
    ‘No,’ Hal said, like it was the dumbest question ever. ‘We were standing in front of bears. I thought I was going to have to get big.’
    
    ‘The men we passed,’ Danna said, ‘early on the hike.’
    
    ‘Yeah,’ Hal said.
    
    ‘I asked you if you thought they were a couple or a father and a son or a father and a grandson or half-brothers or whatever.’
    
    ‘Yeah,’ Hal said.
    
    Danna beamed victory at him. ‘The old one was wearing a windbreaker and the young one was wearing a chore coat and suede boots.’
    
    Because there was no video record of the bears’ sweetness, the memory of it quickly faded. By the time Hal and Danna reached the end of the loop, Danna’s high was gone, replaced by a dry throbbing that seemed to come from her amygdala. When she complained about the pain, Hal put an arm around her and offered to cancel their dinner reservation in town and order them room service instead so they could eat while watching Neon Genesis Evangelion in bed. Danna, who’d found comfort in anime since she was small, and who was often made anxious and queasy by the specific emotional pressure of eating in a nice restaurant anyway, agreed that that was what they should do.
    
     
    
    The resort had a little spa, and, on their last day, Hal and Danna went for massages there. They were instructed to remove their clothes and don robes in a locker room, then head down the hall to a quiet room full of couches and armchairs to await the commencement of their appointments. On a long table at the far side of the room was a tall white pot of hot water, cups and saucers, tea bags, and a glass drink dispenser full of water, ice, and fruit. Hal got them both fruity waters and they sat together, sipping them, waiting for their masseuses. Another guy-and-girl couple was in the room too. They were talking angrily at a tall, visibly gay, managerial-looking man holding an electronic tablet.
    
    ‘He booked it like that online,’ said the girl of the couple.
    
    The manager tapped around on his tablet. ‘I’m not seeing on my end here, ah, a request for a female masseuse – on either of your reservations.’ He looked right at the guy. ‘I’d be happy to rebook you with one later on in the week. Or I can offer you your appointment right now, with our masseur Jay, who’s great.’
    
    ‘That’s a male,’ said the guy.
    
    ‘Correct,’ said the manager.
    
    The guy pointed to his girlfriend. ‘But she has a female.’
    
    ‘You know what,’ said the girl, ‘I’ll take the male.’
    
    ‘Babe –’ said the guy. ‘No –’
    
    Hal and Danna squeezed their pinkies together, hard. Danna felt grateful that they were themselves, and that they hadn’t requested masseurs of any particular sex because they were good and open-minded, because they understood certain things about sexuality and gender and the universe that not everyone could understand; they had found each other because of this fact, the fact that they were so much more specially attuned than most people; they were going to spend their whole lives stumbling into shining moments like this one, moments in which their love felt like it conferred onto them a lucky kind of righteousness. Then Danna thought of Hal pulling across four interstate lanes at once. She thought of how he’d probably been the one who gave her the non-warts kind of HPV, the less embarrassing but worse kind. She thought of how Hal never wiped the table quite right. She thought of how one time he’d gotten $4,700 into credit card debt and she’d cried and sat on the toilet googling number 47 spiritual significance, wondering if there was something to learn. She remembered, even now, that 47 was the atomic number of silver and the country code for Norway, that Mars took 47 years to complete an orbital cycle. She remembered coming out of the bathroom and telling Hal what to do to fix things, which was to call his father, and how Hal had said He’s not a rich man and how she’d said back Didn’t he win a Pulitzer? and how Hal had said A Guggenheim, Danna, in fucking 1989, and how Hal, then, had cried, and how she had walked to the door and said I’m gonna go get a bagel, and when I’m home, this is going to be fixed, and Hal had said It’s going to be fixed, and how things had been fixed because she had demanded they be fixed. She had put her mouth to the hose that reached into the gas valve of Hal’s soul and sucked a fix out of him. Danna thought about Hal’s father’s second novel, whose name she could never remember though it was the one that had gotten him the Guggenheim, though she could remember that it was about two young parents who hated each other and loved each other and fought physically and made up from the fighting by fucking and who once, in a pivotal scene, fucked in front of the newborn, which healed them emotionally. He’d published it when Hal was a toddler. There was a single copy hugged up in a shiny cellophane jacket displayed on a high shelf in Hal’s parents’ living room. Danna tried hard to picture the book and its title. Nothing. When Hal had first read the novel as a teenager, he’d stopped speaking to his father, and he’d started acting out and doing drugs, and he’d had to see a child psychologist, who told Hal that his father was, though an adult, really a lot like him – a boy doing his best – and that his mother, too, was just a girl doing her best, and that marriage was a difficult pursuit, and that by showing grace and understanding to his mother and his father, who were themselves just grown children pained and warped by their own parents’ insufficiencies, Hal would be able to live his life free of the burden of their mistakes, which did, in real life, include fighting and fucking loud and hard across all of the rooms of the house Hal had grown up in. Hal’s problems, Danna told herself now, came from that terrible disgusting incestuous novel, and the shelf it sat on, and the LED lamp that hung just above it, insisting upon the book’s rare specialness, prizing it even above Hal’s.
    
    Danna’s pinky felt numb. Hal was still squeezing it because the horrible couple was still giving the resort spa manager a tough time. Danna squeezed Hal’s pinky once, firmly, to tell him to stop squeezing so hard, and he stopped squeezing, but he kept his pinky locked with hers, and he gave it a little tug when the horrible couple said something particularly nasty to the manager, who was fixing their registration on an iPad. When the manager finally bowed his head and walked away, tucking his iPad under his arm, Danna let herself look at the couple straight on. They were smiling at each other.
    
     
    
    After their massages, Danna and Hal met up again in the waiting room, where they made cups of tea and sat in glowing silence. There was a video playing on a loop on a television in the corner; it showed escalatingly gorgeous drone shots of lavender fields in what looked like the south of France. When they’d had enough, they took their cooling teas with them to the steam room, and as they were the only ones, it seemed, left in the spa, they unbelted their robes and sat together half-naked and sweating and talking about how good they felt and about how horrible the horrible couple from the waiting room had been and about how excited they were to go back to the room and watch more anime and order more room service.
    
    ‘You want to fight for a life with me, right?’ Danna asked Hal.
    
    ‘Baby,’ Hal said, and kissed her shoulder.
    
    ‘Because I want to fight for a life with you.’
    
    Hal looked at Danna, seeming pre-upset. ‘You don’t have to fight for a life with me,’ he said. He said it without malice or strangeness, but Danna, for some reason, picked up both malice and strangeness in how he said it.
    
    ‘What do you mean?’ she asked.
    
    ‘All I want out of, like, my whole life is a life with you,’ Hal said. ‘So you don’t have to like – fight me for it. What do you mean?’
    
    Danna looked up at the wet ceiling and thought of how to answer in a way that wouldn’t destroy the womby post-massage safety they’d both just been feeling. She didn’t know how to explain that her whole life felt like a fight for itself, a struggle against her own every thought and fear; that she nightly had vivid, lucid dreams of having to stab a shadowy home invader with a dull knife over and over again until he finally died and relented his claim on her and her possessions; that she felt she’d never reach a place of true openness in any arena, possibly not even in her relationship with Hal, whom she often thought of as her twin, her brother, a pearl she’d formed from the grit of her own ugliness; so instead she told him she’d meant nothing, and she asked if Hal liked the flavor of tea he’d chosen. He said that he did, and then he asked if Danna liked her flavor, and she said that she did too. Then all at once Danna felt pretty bad; she felt hungover, like there was a nauseous ache in her chest and her head and her butthole; then she was asleep.
    
    When she woke up Hal was patting her face and saying, ‘Whoa whoa whoa.’
    
    ‘Did I just pass out?’ Danna asked Hal.
    
    ‘Yeah,’ Hal said, looking toward the door. He was holding Danna’s shoulders with both hands. She was slouching pretty badly. She realized his hands were kind of all that was holding her up. ‘Hello,’ Hal shouted, ‘excuse me, can we get a little help in here? Jesus fucking Christ,’ he said, because ceiling steam was dripping into his eyes. He blinked hard, trying to get it out, as he pulled Danna’s arms through the armholes of her robe.
    
    ‘I’ve never passed out before,’ Danna said.
    
    ‘It’s hot,’ Hal said. ‘It’s way too fucking hot in here. Hello?’
    
    ‘Have you ever passed out before?’ Danna asked.
    
    ‘No,’ Hal said. ‘I don’t think?’
    
    ‘How would you not remember?’
    
    ‘I think I blacked out for just a second that time I hit my head,’ Hal said, referring to a time a year ago when he’d hit his head, ‘but I’m not sure.’
    
    ‘How could you not be sure?’ Danna asked. She felt radiant, warm, in touch with a higher consciousness. She’d fallen out of her own existence and fallen back into it. As someone who’d now officially passed out, she felt part of a community, part of a new experience; she needed to know whether Hal could share in it, or whether he couldn’t.
    
    ‘How can I be of –’ said the tall gay iPad manager, pushing open the steam-room door, but he didn’t get to the word ‘service’. Danna watched Hal make desperate eye contact with him, and then she watched the manager prop the door open with a towel and duck out. She heard him press something outside and the steam stopped curling up at her from the floor. Soon the manager was back with a tall, sweating glass of water and a wet cloth. He handed both of them to Hal, who handed both of them to Danna, who felt no need for either of them.
    
    ‘I’m fine,’ she said. ‘It wasn’t like I thought it would be. I’m feeling fine. It was kind of the best I’ve ever felt?’
    
    ‘Please drink some water,’ Hal said. He took the cloth from Danna and put it on top of her head. Her pleasure deepened.
    
    ‘Can we go – can we go back to the room with the lavender video?’ she asked, and Hal nodded, and the manager nodded, and together they helped her stand and walk down the dim hallway toward the staging room, and they sat her down on the couch in front of the television, and masseurs and masseuses were bringing her cooler and cooler washcloths, and she couldn’t tear her eyes away from the drone footage, and suddenly there was a squat glass bottle of apple juice before her, and she felt like a baby, and she thought of Hal kissing her shoulder and calling her baby, and she looked over at Hal and told him that she was his baby, and she hugged him, and she sipped her juice, and she thought about her ring, and then, for practice, she made the face she hoped she’d make when Hal gave it to her."

    "text": "Spring should have been full of the odor of spring, of flowers and grass. There should have been blue, shallow scents wafting over the town, deep green odors that assaulted the nostrils like wine in a dark alley. But what the people of Wujiapo noticed under the setting sun was the stench of blood. Dripping red and drifting down from the ridge, one purplish-brown wave after another, like autumn persimmons in the midst of a green spring forest. What in the world is that? someone shouted. People carrying their dinner to the canteen stopped with their rice bowls held mid-air, lifted their heads and sniffed.

    Butcher Li’s family slaughtered another pig, someone observed.
    
    After a moment of silence, everyone went back to their food and drink. The next day was the end of March, it was market day – naturally the butcher’s family would slaughter a pig. But usually Butcher Li woke up early to slaughter his animals, so the meat was still fresh when he arrived in town. Why, then, was he slaughtering at dusk? And why was the stench so much more pungent than usual? The villagers didn’t give the matter much thought. Spring had come, the wheat had woken from winter with a surge of growth, the grass was thick. The fields needed to be hoed and fertilized, and, for those who had access to water, irrigated. Everyone was scurrying around like ants. No one had time to waste thinking about anyone else.
    
    Butcher Li lived up on the ridge by an intersection. When he gave up farming for commerce, it turned out to be fortunate that he lived near the road. He was now in the slaughter business, but still needed a way to transport his goods to market. It was also convenient when families in nearby villages were planning weddings or funerals and wanted to bring him a pig to slaughter. He had built himself a two-story tile-roofed house surrounded by a brick courtyard. The family used the first floor to slaughter pigs, and to sell sundries, food and drink. They lived on the second floor, which also had two small guest rooms. When someone passing by happened to be tired, they might stop and have a bite to eat or drink. If they became tipsy they would proceed upstairs. By the time the sun came up they’d have sobered up, and would drowsily pay their bill and head off.
    
    Even though these small rooms only had a bed and a desk in them, a fifteen-watt bulb and half a candle for when the electricity went out, it turned out that even the County Party Committee’s Party Secretary had slept in one of them. Someone claimed this was only because the Party Secretary’s car had broken down, and that he’d had no choice. You’re farting out of your mouth, Butcher Li retorted. Could anyone really believe that the Party Secretary’s driver would let his car break down? The real reason Party Secretary Zhao stayed, Butcher Li insisted, was because he wanted to visit an ordinary citizen’s house – to see how they were getting by, and to have a chat with a man like Butcher Li.
    
    The Party Secretary did in fact stay at Butcher Li’s for a night, in the east-side guest room. After this, Butcher Li’s business thrived. The table, bed, bedding, slippers, and face-washing basin were carefully cleaned and preserved exactly as they had been left by Party Secretary Zhao. As a result, the room’s price increased 50 percent, from ten to fifteen yuan a night. Everyone wanted to stay in that room. Even long-haul drivers would keep their foot on the gas, determined to spend a night where the Party Secretary had slept.
    
    Just as fine wine cannot be watered down, so Butcher Li’s house still stank of meat. The people of Wujiapo all knew this to be true. And now whenever something extraordinary happened to Butcher Li’s family, the villagers were not surprised. If the county’s Party Secretary had slept in the house, anything could happen there. When, as market day approached, Butcher Li slaughtered a pig in the evening instead of before dawn, filling the spring evening with the stench of blood, no one thought it unusual. After slaughtering and butchering the pig, Butcher Li took two slabs of pork, rinsed them and covered them in plastic wrap. That way no one would be able to tell that it wasn’t fresh pork when the meat was taken to market.
    
    Everyone was still idly eating and chatting in the village canteen. After emptying their bowls, some went home for more rice. Others didn’t want to go home, and tried to send children on their behalf. The children had just emerged from the houses with their own bowls, and didn’t want to turn around to fetch more rice. The parents complained that their children lacked filial instinct, saying that even after they had gone to the trouble of raising them, they were too lazy to return home to get them rice. The parents said that if they had known their children would turn out this way they would never have had them in the first place. The children were aggrieved. They had never actually said they wouldn’t go, and were being yelled at just for hesitating. Who asked you to give birth to me? they said. The parents were stunned, then grabbed the shoes they were sitting on and started hurling them, filling the canteen with dust. The other patrons quickly covered up their bowls to prevent their rice from getting dirty. Through the commotion came a shout. What is everyone arguing about? Is it wrong for parents to ask their children to go home to fetch them rice?
    
    The canteen fell silent. The children realized that they were at fault.
    
    As the villagers drank, they gazed at the road leading to the ridge and saw Butcher Li descending into the village.
    
    –
    
    Liu Genbao left the canteen feeling uneasy, like he was leaving the freedom of the open fields for an examination. When he got home, his father had already finished eating and was smoking in the courtyard, his cigarette flickering in the twilight. Genbao’s mother was in the kitchen washing up. The clanking sound of pots and dishes was drowned out by the sound of running water.
    
    Genbao stepped into the kitchen, took a rice bowl still half full of rice, and pushed it to the edge of the kitchen table. It seemed like he wanted to say something, but instead he just gazed at his mother, then bowed his head and walked outside.
    
    He squatted down in front of his father.
    
    What’s wrong? his father asked.
    
    Nothing.
    
    If something’s wrong, just say it.
    
    Father, Genbao said, I want to go to jail.
    
    His father looked at him in astonishment. Through the glow of the cigarette Genbao watched the old man’s face lose its soft, multi-hued expression and become like hard stone. The father removed his cigarette from his mouth and stared at his son as though he were a total stranger asking for directions.
    
    Genbao, what are you saying?
    
    Because it was getting dark, Genbao couldn’t see the surprise in his father’s eyes. What he saw was a mass of darkness. He removed one of his shoes and sat down in front of his father. He sat quietly with his arms on his knees and his hands interlocked, the way you might sit while peeling beans.
    
    Genbao, his father said, what were you saying just now?
    
    Father, I need to discuss this with you. If you and Mother agree, I want to spend a few nights in jail on someone’s behalf.
    
    Damn it, boy, are you crazy?
    
    Father, Genbao bowed his head, I’m trying to discuss this properly with you.
    
    There was a pause. Then his father asked, On whose behalf do you want to do this?
    
    On behalf of the mayor.
    
    His father laughed. And why would the mayor need you to do this?
    
    Just now, in the canteen, Butcher Li said that the mayor ran over a young man in his twenties, someone from Zhangzhai village. Butcher Li said that someone needs to take responsibility for the mayor’s actions. The mayor is the mayor. Who can make him take responsibility for anything? So someone else needs to go to the county’s transportation division and claim responsibility. They need to say, I’m the one who ran that person over – I had too much to drink at Butcher Li’s, and then I ran over the young man in my tractor. We won’t need to worry about what happens afterwards, because the mayor has already taken care of everything. Butcher Li said that the family of the man from Zhangzhai has already been given money. But whoever claims responsibility for the accident will need to go to the Public Security Bureau’s squad room and stay there for a week or two.
    
    The moon had risen in the sky. Wujiapo was so quiet it was like there was no village there at all. Genbao’s mother seemed to have heard everything he’d said. She didn’t immediately respond, and instead she brought a small flower basket and a stool outside. She placed the stool between her husband and her son, then placed the basket on the stool. She sat down in front of the flowers and looked at her son and her husband. She sighed, and joined the silence that was extending between them.
    
     
    
    By this point Genbao was already twenty-nine, but he had yet to find a wife and establish a family – and in this respect the Liu family was different. Not because they were poor, since they no longer were all that poor. They were just different. When the drought came, every other family in the village built tile-roofed houses, while the Liu family stayed in their original thatched-roof house. Genbao was a timid, honest man. When the family’s crops were being eaten by another family’s livestock, Genbao would lift his shovel to beat the animals like anyone else, but as soon as he did he’d remember that the livestock had an owner, and slowly he’d put the shovel away. Who would dare marry someone as cowardly as that? The family had tried several matchmaking sessions, but whenever a young woman came to the Liu house, she would take one look at Genbao and promptly leave without a word. Now Genbao had to struggle to set up meetings with women looking for a second marriage, much less a first.
    
    Half a year earlier, a relative offered to introduce Genbao to a widow. They didn’t specify what the widow looked like, but they did say that she was twenty-six and already had two children. Genbao was reluctant, but the relative said, Why don’t you meet her before deciding? Genbao agreed.
    
    To his surprise the first thing she asked was, Do you have any brothers?
    
    I’m an only child, Genbao replied.
    
    Does your family share a surname with any of the other families in the village?
    
    Ours is the only family in the village with the surname Liu.
    
    Do you have any relatives currently serving in a village or township cadre?
    
    Genbao shook his head.
    
    Sighing, the woman stood up. Then why in the world did you have me come all this way to see you? she said, angrily. Didn’t the matchmaker tell you that my first husband got in a fight with someone over land and water, and hung himself because the other person got the better of him? Didn’t the matchmaker tell you that I’m not looking for money, but for a man with power – someone who doesn’t need to bully others? At the very least I need a man who can avoid being bullied. The woman walked out of the house. She looked around the courtyard, then turned and stared at Genbao. Today is market day, she said, and I’ve wasted the entire day traveling twelve or thirteen li for you to see me. I could have gone into town to sell vegetables instead, and I would have earned seventy or eighty yuan. Instead you tricked me into coming here. I’m not going to ask you to compensate me for the entire eighty yuan, but don’t you think that at the very least you should give me fifty?
    
    What are you talking about? Genbao asked in surprise.
    
    You tricked me into wasting an entire day, so you should compensate me fifty yuan.
    
    Genbao ground his teeth. How can you be so shameless?
    
    Yes, I am shameless, the woman said. I won’t leave until you beat me or give me fifty yuan. If you won’t do either, I’ll start screaming. I’ll say that you fondled me as soon as you saw me.
    
    Genbao had no choice but to go back inside and fetch a fifty-yuan bill. He thrust it into her hand. Get out of here, he said. I don’t ever want to see you in Wujiapo again.
    
    The woman took the money and looked at it. If you dare to slap me right now, she said, I’ll marry you.
    
    Get out of here. I’ve given you the money, so go ahead and leave.
    
    You’re ill, the woman said, mentally ill. You should go to the clinic and get treated. The woman threw the fifty-yuan bill at Genbao and walked away. After taking several steps, she turned around and said, You’re a spineless wimp. Whoever marries you is guaranteed to be bullied for the rest of her life.
    
    To tell the truth, no one ever did bully Genbao’s family. But because their home only had a single door and a single courtyard, and they didn’t have close relatives or belong to a larger clan, Genbao was unable to find a wife. He was already twenty-nine, and in the blink of an eye would be thirty, which is to say that he’d lived half a lifetime. For Genbao to be almost thirty without a family or career left him unable to lift his head in the village, and made his parents feel a deep sense of regret, like they had let their son down.
    
     
    
    Genbao’s father finished one pack of cigarettes then picked up another. He didn’t immediately light a new one, and instead placed the pack at his feet. He took a handful of peanuts and began peeling them, but he didn’t eat them. He gazed at his son in the moonlight. Genbao was still sitting on his shoe with his head bowed, like a soft bundle on the ground. The father gazed at the family’s thatch-roofed house, which they’d never been able to afford to renovate. The house was short and dilapidated. On the slope was a grass pit that was near collapse. In the moonlight it resembled an open grave. There was the windowless kitchen, in the doorway a broken water jar. The pigsty, mud wall, door frame, and stone trough were all very sturdy, but for some reason the family had never succeeded in raising pigs. Whenever they tried, the pigs died. Then they tried sheep, but the sheep died. In the end the family turned the pigsty into a chicken coop. But even during the peak egg-laying season in summer the hens could go three to five days without laying. None of their hens could lay an egg every other day, much less every day, like some families’ hens – some even laid two eggs a day, or at least three eggs every two days. This is how the Liu family lived, and at that moment Genbao’s father seemed to be able to see it all laid out before him. He shifted his gaze away from the moonlight, ate some of the peanuts he was holding, and complained that they were dry and tasteless. Have some of these, his wife said, Uncle brought them down from the ridge today. Genbao’s father took a handful of peanuts and proceeded to peel them. Genbao, he said, eat up!
    
    I don’t want any.
    
    How do you know that if you plead guilty on behalf of the mayor, you’ll only get a week or two in jail?
    
    That’s what Butcher Li said.
    
    And who did Butcher Li hear it from?
    
    Why would he need to hear it from anybody? said Genbao. The mayor killed the man in front of his place. The Party Secretary even spent a night there once.
    
    So what will you do after you complete the mayor’s sentence? his mother asked.
    
    Give it a rest, the father said. You ask what Genbao is going to do after he gets out? What do you think he’ll do? Who asked the mayor to be mayor, or to make our son go to jail on the mayor’s behalf ?
    
    With that he turned and looked at his son. Genbao, if you really want to do this, then go ahead. Tell Butcher Li you are willing to go to jail for the mayor. But remember, Butcher Li’s real name is Li Xing, so call him Uncle Li Xing. Don’t call him Butcher Li to his face.
    
     
    
    It was hectic at Butcher Li’s. The family had added a couple of 200-watt lightbulbs to the courtyard, which drowned out the moonlight. One of the region’s mines was having a celebration, and many people had arrived with pigs for Butcher Li to slaughter. But the next day was market day, and Butcher Li couldn’t neglect his regulars. Butcher Li had to remove his regular cutting board and set up a larger one. He did the slaughtering himself, but had hired two young people from a neighboring village to help.
    
    There was a crowd in the courtyard – miners, village children, customers from local villages. Genbao could hear the bloody screams coming from the slaughterhouse all the way up from the village. He shuddered, but controlled himself. They were only pigs, not people. As he stepped through the courtyard gate, which was large enough for a car, there were already two slabs of pork hanging from the rack. A shirtless Butcher Li was dousing them with water. He dished out one scoop of water after another, and red blood flowed over the muddy ground and through a ditch to the back of the house. The stench of blood permeated everything. One of the young men helping Butcher Li was boiling a pot of water to scald the pig’s hide, while the other was shaving off the remaining hair. Pig hair has a peculiar stench, like animal hide roasting in a fire. Butcher Li’s house was filled with this smell all year round, and Genbao couldn’t imagine how the Party Secretary put up with it. But the Party Secretary had. There was a bright sign on the door of the east-side guest room that read: the county party committee’s party secretary zhao slept here. Genbao noticed that the west-side room had a sign now too, which read: the county’s mayor slept here. Genbao was confused. He hadn’t heard that the mayor had stayed at Butcher Li’s, but he figured he must have, because otherwise Butcher Li would not have put up a sign.
    
    Genbao squeezed through the crowd and went over to Butcher Li. He waited until Butcher Li had finished rinsing the slab of pork, then quietly greeted him: Uncle Li.
    
    Without turning around, Butcher Li wiped the drops of bloody water from his shoulder and used his forearm to wipe sweat from his brow. Then he started rinsing another bloody slab of pork. Is that Genbao? he asked.
    
    Yes, Uncle Li, it’s me.
    
    Butcher Li tossed a scoop of water into the pig’s abdominal cavity.
    
    Are you here to accept punishment on the mayor’s behalf ? This is a great opportunity. People burn incense for a chance like this.
    
    The bloody water splashed onto Genbao’s face, and he took a step back.
    
    I’ve discussed it with my father, and I’m willing to do it.
    
    Butcher Li tossed another scoop of water.
    
    It’s not simply a question of whether you are willing. Go inside and wait.
    
    Inside, Genbao found three other villagers sitting in the dining room. One was Wu Zhuzi, from the west side of the village. Zhuzi was in his forties, but his wife had recently run away with her children to a neighboring village, where she was staying with the younger brother of a village cadre. Another was Zhao Quezi, or ‘Cripple Zhao’, from the south side of the village. Quezi had been living a good life until a brick kiln collapsed and injured him. His life imploded, and he’d gotten into debt with the credit union. Then there was Li Qing, who had a business in town, and whose family had bought a GAZ car to transport goods to market. Genbao knew Zhuzi and Quezi were there to try to serve the mayor’s jail time, just like he was. But he wasn’t sure what Li Qing wanted.
    
    Li Qing’s head was bowed in embarrassment. He looked as though he had just stolen something. My younger brother graduated from the teachers college this year, he said, and I was hoping the mayor would be able to help arrange for him to return to the village to teach.
    
    Zhuzi gazed coldly at Li Qing and said, You’re already doing well for yourself.
    
    Li Qing bowed his head even further, his face redder than the bloodstained snow on the ground outside.
    
    Genbao sat down on the empty stool. Outside, a pig was crying out, rough and scary – like a train whistle, only shorter and the tones uneven. Mixed in with the cry was the sound of breathing and people shouting. After a while, everything fell quiet again. The blade had moved from the pig’s neck to its internal organs. All that remained was the sound of Butcher Li instructing his assistants to shave one pig and disembowel another – and the voices of those commenting on which pigs were lean and which were fat. It was warm inside, and Butcher Li, busy earning his money, seemed to have no interest in the young men waiting for him.
    
    Butcher Li’s wife and children were upstairs watching television, and the sound of martial arts descended from the rooftop like bricks and tiles. Genbao gazed up at the ceiling, as did the other three.
    
    It’s the middle of the night, said Li Qing.
    
    If you’re in a hurry you can leave, Zhuzi replied.
    
    I’m not in a hurry, Li Qing said. I’ll wait until sunrise if I need to.
    
    Quezi turned to Genbao. Brother, don’t make the same mistake as us. You don’t have a family, and you’re educated. If you end up going to jail for the mayor, your reputation will be ruined. Then how will you ever manage to marry and raise a family?
    
    Genbao wanted to respond, but he couldn’t think of what to say. As he was struggling to respond, Li Qing answered for him. It’s only by doing this on the mayor’s behalf that he’ll ever be able to establish a family. Genbao looked gratefully at Li Qing, and Li Qing nodded.
    
    Because Li Qing and Butcher Li were relatives, Li Qing was more at ease in the house than the others. He looked around, and even went upstairs to watch some television. When he came back down he went out to Butcher Li to ask him to make up his mind. But after a long loop through the house, Li Qing came back and said, Uncle Li’s busy. He told me we have to decide among ourselves which of us goes.
    
    Choose among themselves? But how could they choose? This was no solution, since none of them would choose anyone but themselves. The four of them stared at one another, but seeing that no one showed any hint of backing down, they all turned away.
    
    Time trudged forward like a rhinoceros. By this point the night was as dark as a bottomless well. They all sat there until the television upstairs fell silent. Butcher Li slaughtered five pigs in a row, and Zhuzi and Quezi fell asleep leaning against the edge of the table. Genbao assumed Butcher Li had completely forgotten about them. He wanted to go ask Butcher Li to let him claim responsibility for the mayor’s crime. If he was selected, he would head off right away; otherwise he could at least return home to sleep.
    
    Just then someone started pounding on the door.
    
    It wasn’t Butcher Li, but one of the young men who’d come to help him. He was pounding on the door with the knife he used for the pigs, and the fresh blood on the blade trembled like soft tofu and fell to the ground. Seeing that everyone was awake, the young man tossed four balls of paper onto the table. It’s already late, he said, and Uncle Li says that you shouldn’t keep waiting. Here are four lots – one of them contains a black pig hair, while the other three contain white ones. Whoever gets the black hair can be the mayor’s benefactor.
    
    Suddenly, the four guests were wide awake. The answer was before them. The lots had been made of paper from a cigarette pack, cut into four pieces. From the outside each was red and florid, festive and auspicious, but three contained white pig hairs. The guests all stared at the lots, their eyes large and bright. None of them wanted to make the first move.
    
    Take them, the young man said. Go ahead and take your lots, so that I can get back to the pigs.
    
    Without speaking, Li Qing picked up one of the pieces of paper.
    
    Everyone else followed.
    
    Genbao took the final lot. But before he had opened his, he heard Zhuzi burst out laughing. Mine is the black pig hair! My wife and child will finally be returned to me! He placed his lot in the middle of the table. A horrible smell radiated up from the black pig hair.
    
    Well deserved, said the young man in the doorway. You go be the mayor’s benefactor. Now everyone else can go to bed.
    
    Quezi looked at the white pig hair in his hand. Damn it, he said, I should have left ages ago!
    
    Li Qing looked at the black pig hair on the table, and without a word got up and walked away, kicking the door frame on his way out.
    
    Genbao also left without saying a word.
    
    Outside, a cool breeze was blowing down the mountain ridge road, and from afar wafted the green fragrance of the wheat seedlings. Genbao took a deep breath and discovered that he wasn’t in the least bit tired.
    
     
    
    When Genbao got home his parents were out. Entering the courtyard, he smelled baked buns. In the middle of the room there was a stool with a blue package on it. He opened the package and found the clothing his mother had purchased in anticipation of his jail time – pants, shirts, socks, and shoes. His mother had even packed a few summer shirts and shorts. The package also contained cloth shoes and three pairs of new military-style liberation shoes that his mother had somehow managed to purchase. Genbao had no idea why his mother had packed him so many different pairs of shoes. Even if he had been able to go to jail, he would still have returned within a week or two, so why so many pairs of shoes?
    
    By this point it was the middle of the night, and apart from the pig cries drifting down from Butcher Li’s house up on the ridge, there wasn’t a sound in the village. The room was permeated with the soapy-rotten smell of new shoes and old clothing, combined with the sweet noodle-paste smell of the shoe soles. Genbao stood for a while in front of the package, then went to the kitchen table. His mother had prepared him some dried food. The scent of baked buns mixed with chopped scallions and sesame oil flowed like water, dripping down from the table onto the floor. Each bun had been baked until it was as large as a griddle, and then cut into quarters. Each yielded twelve pieces, stacked neatly in the middle of the table.
    
    When Genbao saw the baked buns he began to weep.
    
    He went back out and stood in the middle of the courtyard. To the west he could see the entire sleeping village. In this array of tile-roofed houses, all glowing blue in the moonlight, his own family’s house was like a pile of dead grass. Genbao felt an acute sense of sorrow. As he started back inside, his neighbor’s sister-in-law arrived.
    
    Brother Genbao, she said, I heard what’s happened. Your parents were at my place, and we were all very anxious. Fortunately for you, my younger cousin just got divorced, and she came to visit me today. When she heard you were going to jail on the mayor’s behalf, and that you were single, she immediately agreed to marry you. Your parents are taking her back to my house now. You should go meet her. She is as tender as though she had never been married. Genbao, why don’t you hurry up and go? she asked. What are you staring at?
    
    The neighbor’s sister-in-law was originally from a town forty li away, and she was svelte and smart. She took Genbao’s hand and tried to lead him back to her home. He felt the cotton-softness and warmth of her hand, and smelled the feminine scent of her hair, like the smell of summer wheat suddenly wafting through a cold, winter’s day, and a hot excitement went through his body. His head buzzed, and he had to struggle to extricate himself from her grasp. He wanted to say that he wasn’t going to jail for the mayor, that Zhuzi was the one who had drawn the correct lot. But what he ended up saying instead was, Please don’t pull me.
    
    What’s wrong? the neighbor’s sister-in-law said. Won’t you marry my cousin?
    
    I’m going to jail, Genbao said. That’s not a good thing.
    
    But you’re going to jail on behalf of the mayor.
    
    The sentence might not be just ten or twenty days. Someone was killed. The sentence could be six months or a year.
    
    The neighbor’s sister-in-law laughed. Did you see the three pairs of liberation shoes in your packet? My cousin went to the neighboring village’s supply and marketing depot in the middle of the night to buy them. She said people in jail all need to work in a brick factory making bricks, and it’s hard on their shoes. Whenever someone is sent to that sort of labor camp, they need to serve at least a year.
    
    So I might need to serve two or three?
    
    My cousin cherishes affection, the sister-in-law replied. She divorced her husband because he was always looking for mistresses in the city. She isn’t worried about you serving jail time. She’s just afraid of men who have money to spend on city hotels and bathhouses.
    
    In that case, tell me – if I go to your house to meet her, what should I say?
    
    Take a few pieces of the scallion buns your mother baked for you and say that you’ve brought her a midnight snack.
    
    The neighbor’s sister-in-law left. She walked briskly, like a goat hopping through a grassy field. As Genbao stood watching her, she turned and said, Act quickly. If you delay, the sun will come up and she will melt into the night.
    
    Genbao did not return to the kitchen for the baked bun pieces as his neighbor’s sister-in-law had urged him to do. Instead, he continued standing in the courtyard, reflecting for a moment. Then he followed the neighbor’s sister-in-law out the courtyard gate. He did not go to her house, but headed for the west side of the village. He went to Zhuzi’s house. Zhuzi’s house was tile-roofed. Even the house’s gate tower had a tile roof. The building was large and tall, and it obviously belonged to a well-off family. But even though the family was wealthy, the wife had run off with another man – a carpenter, the younger brother of a village party secretary.
    
    Through the gate, Genbao could see that the lights were still on. Naturally, Zhuzi had not yet gone to bed. The next morning, after breakfast, he would need to go with Butcher Li into town to meet the mayor. After meeting the mayor, he would need to be driven to the county seat’s public security bureau. Then he would be detained and taken to jail to await trial, after which it would be many days before he’d be able to return home. Needless to say, Zhuzi would need to spend the entire night preparing for his trip to jail.
    
    Genbao knocked lightly on the gate.
    
    The gate was made of solid elm wood, and Genbao felt as though he was knocking on stone. By that point the moon had set, and in the darkness, the knocking flew down the village street like small stones. No sound emerged in response.
    
    Genbao knocked harder.
    
    Finally, Zhuzi answered. Who is it?
    
    Brother Zhuzi, it’s me.
    
    Oh, Genbao. What’s the matter?
    
    Open the gate. There is something I need to tell you.
    
    Zhuzi came out of the house to open the gate. As he did so, Genbao knelt down in front of him.
    
    Genbao, Zhuzi said, taking a step back, what are you doing? What does this mean?
    
    Brother Zhuzi, let me go to jail on the mayor’s behalf. You, for better or worse, have already established a family, and you know what it’s like to be a man. But I’ll be thirty soon, and I still don’t know what it’s like to be a man. If you let me go to jail on the mayor’s behalf, he will surely ask me if there’s anything he can help with, and the first thing I’ll ask is that he help return your wife and child to you. OK?
    
    Zhuzi stared at Genbao in the lamplight.
    
    Genbao kowtowed and said, Brother Zhuzi, I’m begging you.
    
    If I let you go, you’ll speak to the mayor on my behalf ?
    
    If I don’t discuss your problem first, and fail to ask the mayor to help return your wife and child to you, then let me, Genbao, have even lower status than your great-grandson.
    
    Then stand up, Zhuzi said.
    
    Genbao kowtowed to Zhuzi three more times before standing up.
    
     
    
    The next day, spring-morning sunlight rained down like a river of gold. The mountain fields, ridges, forests and villages glimmered. When the residents of Wujiapo woke up on that spring morning, everyone knew that an auspicious event had occurred in Genbao’s household. Genbao was going to go to jail on behalf of the mayor. His travel bundle was packed, his bedding was folded and tied, and his baked scallion buns were ready in his dry-food bag.
    
    Genbao was going to be the mayor’s benefactor.
    
    He drank a bowl of Sichuan millet soup, ate some pickled vegetables and fried buns, and when he walked out the door with his bags, he saw several villagers standing in front of his house – a crowd that included Li Qing, Quezi, Zhuzi, his neighbor’s sister-in-law, and the sister-in-law’s cousin. Genbao and the cousin had become engaged overnight. Even if you are jailed for a year or two, she had told him, I’ll still wait for you. The next morning, she accompanied her elder cousin to come see Genbao off. Most of the villagers didn’t yet know that the two of them were engaged, and assumed that she had simply come with her cousin to watch the commotion.
    
    Genbao’s father was standing behind him, holding Genbao’s bags and bedding. He looked proud, like his son was leaving home to accomplish something big. He had set aside his regular cigarettes and was smoking filter tips. But he wasn’t really smoking, he was merely using it to produce swirls of smoke. Genbao’s mother was holding the dry-ration bag, and when she stepped outside and saw the sister-in-law’s cousin, her face brightened as she walked toward her. Genbao couldn’t hear what his mother said to the woman, but he could see them talking. The cousin took the bag of rations from his mother, and supported her as though she were an elderly person crossing a bridge. In this group of people who had gathered to see Genbao off, the sister-in-law’s cousin resembled a summer flower blooming on a grassy hill. She was from the town, and her family’s home had been separated from the town government compound by only a single wall. When she was young, she would often run into the town government’s courtyard holding her rice bowl. Like her elder cousin, she was unusually worldly, and her clothing, speech, and behavior were quite different from the other Wujiapo residents. When she took Genbao’s mother by the arm, everyone who saw the gesture felt their hearts brighten, and they looked on with surprise and envy.
    
    The crowd had originally consisted of ten or so people, but after Genbao and his family emerged, it grew. When people on their way to work in the fields heard that Genbao was going to be the mayor’s benefactor, they hurried over to congratulate him and to see him off. Brother Genbao, one said, as you advance, make sure you don’t forget us! What do you mean, as I advance? Genbao said. I’m going to jail! But on whose behalf ? the other person said. For the mayor. You’re going to be the mayor’s savior and benefactor. I once thought of you as a brother, and never imagined that you had such great prospects before you.
    
    Genbao smiled, but did not respond.
    
    Genbao slowly walked among the crowd that had gathered. Someone tried to take his baggage for him, but he said there was no need. He took a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and handed one to everyone. If anyone declined, Genbao stuffed a cigarette directly into their mouth. He wanted to approach where Zhuzi, Quezi, and Li Qing were huddling peacefully by the roadside, as though the previous night’s struggle had never happened. But so many people were crowding tightly around him, struggling to speak to him, that in the end he had no choice but to simply wave and nod. It had been a long time since the villagers had seen someone off in such a festive fashion. Even when a villager’s son left to join the military, people didn’t turn out like this. Pleased, Genbao walked toward the village entrance, and when he reached the canteen he stopped and waved to the crowd, saying, Go home, go home! I’m going to jail, not joining the military.
    
    Everyone followed him all the way up the hill toward Butcher Li’s house.
    
    From the sunlit ridge, Butcher Li was gesturing to the crowd. Genbao quickened his pace, but the faster he moved, the more Butcher Li seemed to gesture. It looked like he was holding his hands up to his mouth and shouting. But because he was so far away no one could hear him clearly. Everyone guessed that he was trying to tell Genbao to hurry up.
    
    Genbao jogged forward in front of the crowd. He didn’t want Butcher Li to have to wait too long up on the ridge. But as Genbao was leaving the crowd of villagers and running up the ridge, one of the young men who had been helping Butcher Li slaughter the night before ran part of the way down toward him. As he approached, the young man stood on a stone by the side of the road and shouted to Genbao, Uncle Li says for you not to come up, he shouted. The mayor sent over a message this morning saying that he doesn’t need anyone to claim responsibility on his behalf.
    
    Abruptly, Genbao came to a stop. He stood in the middle of the road like a telephone pole, staring at the young man. What are you saying? he shouted. My God, what are you saying?
    
    There’s no need for you to go to prison, the young man shouted back. The parents of the man the mayor ran over are reasonable people. They don’t blame the mayor for what happened, and they didn’t report him. They didn’t even want compensation. All they asked was that the mayor accept the dead man’s younger brother as his godson . . .
    
    Genbao’s legs began to feel weak. He struggled to channel strength down to his ankles to prevent himself from collapsing. He gazed up at the top of the ridge, where Butcher Li was directing several people to load a car with fresh pork. Butcher Li had his back to Genbao. He was dancing back and forth. His shoulders were as wide as a door, and his strength defied description.
    
    The villagers were approaching, talking and laughing. The sun rose higher in the sky – bright, bright red."

    "text": "I was in the waiting room. Then I was in the examination room. There was a chair, and another chair, and a hydraulic doctor bed. Sit down, the doctor said. I didn’t know where. Not on the bed, he said. I sat on a chair.

    ‘I think I have a concussion,’ I said.
    
    ‘Why do you think that?’ the doctor said.
    
    ‘My nephew hit me.’
    
    ‘He hit you?’
    
    ‘In the nose. Then in the back of the head.’
    
    ‘How old is he?’ the doctor said.
    
    ‘Fourteen,’ I said.
    
    ‘Okay,’ he said, ‘take off your shirt.’
    
    ‘Really?’ I said.
    
    ‘Sure,’ the doctor said. I unbuttoned my shirt. He shone a light in my eyes.
    
    The light was on the end of a cone. The cone was set at ninety degrees on the end of a metal rod. It looked like a thing dentists use for looking at mouths.
    
    ‘No concussion,’ the doctor said. It didn’t seem like he could tell that just by shining a cone in my eyes.
    
    ‘Looks like you have a little eczema here, though,’ he said. He pointed to my chest then spun away in his chair.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    I looked down at myself. There was a red patch, and what looked like a slightly raised piece of dead skin in the centre of my chest. Just to the right of where I assumed my heart was.
    
    ‘Okay,’ I said.
    
    ‘Don’t worry,’ he said, looking at his computer, ‘very treatable. I’m writing you a prescription. For hydrocortisol cream.’
    
    ‘Don’t you mean hydrocortisone?’
    
    ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘hydrocortisone. That is what I said.’
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    My brother’s wife, when I was back at the house, said I shouldn’t have provoked her son.
    
    ‘He’s very sensitive,’ she said.
    
    ‘What?’ I said. ‘I didn’t provoke him.’
    
    ‘He loved your dad,’ my brother’s wife said. ‘They had a real connection.’
    
    ‘I don’t see what that has to do with anything.’
    
    ‘Are you really going to wear that outfit?’ she said. I was wearing a T-shirt with lots of Phils on it: Phil Leotardo, Phil Neville, the Philippines, the concept of ‘Philanthropy’, Philadelphia (the spread), the London Philharmonic, Prince Philip.
    
    ‘What?’ I said. ‘No. I am going to wear a suit.’
    
    ‘It has a stain on it. You can’t wear that.’
    
    ‘I am going to change,’ I said.
    
    My brother walked into the kitchen and kissed his wife on the forehead as she walked out of it. He started doing something in a cupboard.
    
    ‘You should wear the Phil T-shirt to Dad’s funeral,’ he said.
    
    ‘I am going to change,’ I said, and left the room.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    I looked at myself in the half-steamed bathroom mirror. This was the house I grew up in.
    
    The doctor was right about the skin on my chest, just to the right of where I assumed my heart was. It looked all weird.
    
    I picked at the skin. It came away painlessly.
    
    Just a little at first. It made a thick and translucent white flap. I flicked at it with my fingernail. I pulled at it. More pulled away like damp paper. Over my left nipple, then right up to my armpit.
    
    It started to sting a little like it was meant to stay on. I stopped tearing myself. The skin just hung there.
    
    Then I kept going.
    
    I couldn’t walk around with half my chest hanging off me.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Once I’d torn it mostly off, I had an alarmingly large piece of skin in my hands. I looked at it.
    
    It was me but losing its shape, still slightly ridged where it had run over my ribcage.
    
    I looked at my body in the mirror.
    
    There was a long rift where I’d removed the dead skin. It poked outwards, up the side of me, almost imperceptibly, like the unfindable edge of a Sellotape roll.
    
    I didn’t know what to do with the skin that had come off. I couldn’t leave it in the bathroom bin where my brother or his wife would find it. And I didn’t want to flush it, either.
    
    I thought about putting it in my pocket and taking it downstairs and wrapping it in a plastic bag and disposing of it secretly. But that felt insane. And I didn’t want to get caught doing it.
    
    I dropped the skin into the bathtub. It made a slap sound. I turned the showerhead on all the way. I pointed it at the skin. After a moment it began to break apart, as if decomposing, and the tiny pieces of it were carried by the spiralling water down the sloping porcelain, down into the plughole.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    After the funeral, at the wake, which was at the house, my nephew apologised for punching me.
    
    ‘I’m sorry for punching you in your head,’ he said. ‘No problem,’ I said.
    
    ‘I just get so angry sometimes,’ he said.
    
    ‘Right,’ I said.
    
    ‘Don’t you?’ he said.
    
    I poured myself more wine from the bottle I was guarding from everyone else. The new skin was tender under my shirt, under my jacket.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    The living room was large but full of mourners. My uncle by marriage was holding court on refreshments.
    
    ‘Yes, I borrowed it from work,’ he said. ‘From the work canteen.’
    
    He was talking about a large metal urn that stored and dispensed near-boiling water.
    
    ‘I thought a lot of people would want tea,’ my uncle said, ‘and that this would make it easier.’
    
    ‘It must have been hard to get here,’ I said, ‘with all the hot water in.’
    
    ‘What?’ he said.
    
    ‘Imagine if it spilled on someone,’ I said. ‘They’d get all burnt.’
    
    ‘No,’ he said, ‘you don’t transport it full. That’d be dangerous.’
    
    ‘That’s what I’m saying,’ I said.
    
    ‘What are you doing for work at the moment?’ he said. ‘Still writing? Like your parents?’
    
    ‘Yeah,’ I said.
    
    ‘And the money’s alright? I read an article about how books don’t make money anymore. Barely any of you make any money.’
    
    My brother walked over. He was holding a glass of wine and a beer.
    
    ‘I see you have two drinks,’ I said, to him. ‘Nice.’
    
    He tried to hand the beer to my uncle, who put his palms up and made a goofy face, then mimed driving a car.
    
    ‘Thanks for apologising to your nephew,’ my brother said, to me.
    
    ‘I didn’t,’ I said.
    
    ‘He really appreciated it.’
    
    ‘I didn’t apologise. He apologised to me.’
    
    ‘Sure,’ my brother said.
    
    ‘Hey,’ I said. ‘Some of my skin came off earlier.’
    
    My brother was a plastic surgeon. That was his job. ‘What?’ he said.
    
    ‘In the shower. Like a reptile.’
    
    ‘Your skin came off?’
    
    ‘Like a reptile,’ I repeated.
    
    ‘That sounds like eczema. You should see a doctor.’
    
    ‘You are a doctor.’
    
    ‘I’m not a skin doctor.’
    
    ‘You are a skin doctor.’
    
    ‘No, I’m not. I’m a surgeon. I’m not looking at your eczema skin.’
    
    ‘I saw a doctor today,’ I said, ‘and he gave me a cream.’ I tried to pour myself more wine from my bottle but it was empty.
    
    ‘So use the cream,’ my brother said. I walked away to get another drink.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    Back in the kitchen, a neighbour from down the road said it had been a beautiful ceremony.
    
    ‘That was a beautiful ceremony,’ she said.
    
    She was older than sixty and wore purple all the time.
    
    Even to funerals.
    
    ‘It was?’ I said.
    
    But she thought I was just agreeing. ‘He would have loved it.’
    
    ‘He would have?’
    
    ‘He would have found it very moving.’
    
    ‘I thought he might have found it disappointing,’ I said, ‘being dead.’
    
    ‘Yes, he would have found it very moving,’ she said. ‘He was a very emotional man. A true artist.’
    
    I thought about my father in the audience of my brother’s school flute recital, holding a biro and the photocopied programme, ticking off each act as it finished.
    
    I thought about my father in the audience of my brother’s school prize-giving, slumped. I thought about him sitting up, suddenly, when a small girl, maybe nine, won an award for ‘dance’. I thought about him saying loudly, incredulously – loud enough for parents to shush him – ‘Darts?’
    
    ‘You knew him pretty well,’ I said.
    
    ‘We had a connection,’ she said. ‘He was a true artist.’ I looked around for a different conversation.
    
    ‘And so kind,’ she said, ‘staying with your mother. After everything.’
    
    I drank the last of my new glass of wine. I put the glass down on the counter hard.
    
    ‘Listen, you stupid purple bitch,’ I said. ‘Shut the fuck up about my dad.’
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    I woke up hungover in my childhood bedroom. I was still wearing my shoes and trousers.
    
    My white shirt had quite a lot of blood on it. My head hurt under my face.
    
    I took my shoes off and went downstairs to make coffee.
    
    My brother’s wife was in the kitchen already.
    
    ‘Coffee?’ I said. I gestured at her with a mug. She didn’t say anything. She just made a sound and left the room.
    
    My brother walked in as she walked out. He kissed her on the forehead as they passed each other.
    
    ‘Got some blood on you,’ he said.
    
    ‘Make me some coffee.’
    
    I sat down at the breakfast island in the middle of the kitchen. The tea urn was gone. But there were glasses and mugs everywhere. The foily remains of wake snacks.
    
    I took my cigarettes out and lit one. ‘Jesus Christ,’ my brother said.
    
    ‘My head hurts,’ I said.
    
    ‘She got you good,’ he said.
    
    ‘I should have hit her back,’ I said.
    
    ‘As if you could,’ he said. ‘She made you look like a little bitch.’
    
    ‘Yeah,’ I said.
    
    ‘You are a little bitch,’ my brother’s wife shouted, from another room.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    I heard my brother and his wife leave to get some air or something. So I called my girlfriend.
    
    It rang once. Then the line went dead. There was no option for voicemail.
    
    I let myself count the days in my head. I had last seen her three weeks ago tomorrow.
    
    Maybe she had blocked my number now.
    
    The wood felt cold and crumb-covered against my forehead.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    My brother drove me and his wife to our mother’s nursing home. My brother’s wife made sure she sat up front so I sat in the back of their car, which was small, but new, and expensive-seeming.
    
    ‘How was the funeral?’ my mother said, from her chair, which was disgusting.
    
    ‘It was beautiful,’ my brother’s wife said. ‘It was a really beautiful ceremony, Rebecca. Everyone said so.’
    
    ‘I’m so glad,’ my mother said.
    
    ‘Have you got everything you need, Mum? Do you need us to bring anything?’ my brother said, louder than necessary. My mother ignored him.
    
    ‘What happened to your face?’ she said.
    
    ‘Cheryl hit me,’ I said.
    
    ‘Why would she do that?’ my mother said.
    
    ‘I was defending Dad’s honour.’
    
    ‘He called her a stupid purple bitch,’ my brother said.
    
    ‘Shut up,’ I said.
    
    ‘Oh, no,’ my mother said.
    
    ‘I didn’t,’ I said.
    
    ‘Oh, no,’ my mother said.
    
    ‘And my skin is peeling off, Mum,’ I said. ‘I’m very frightened.’
    
    ‘What?’ my mother said.
    
    ‘Nothing,’ my brother said. ‘He is just joking. He has some eczema. He is just joking.’
    
    ‘I hope you didn’t hit her back,’ my mother said.
    
    ‘I got her good. Spark out,’ I said. I mimed a jab with my right. ‘Cheryl’s in the hospital.’
    
    ‘Oh, no,’ my mother said.
    
    ‘No, he didn’t,’ my brother’s wife said. ‘He’s just trying to upset you. He didn’t hit her.’
    
    ‘She’s messed up,’ I said. ‘She’ll never look the same.’
    
    ‘Oh, no,’ my mother said.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    ‘Maybe we should just kill Mum,’ I said, in the foyer of the nursing home, as we were leaving. ‘No parents, no rules. Clean break.’
    
    ‘Shut up,’ my brother’s wife said.
    
    ‘What did you say the advance on your book was?’ my brother said.
    
    He meant my second book, the book I had told everyone I was writing, and got paid an advance on.
    
    I had told everyone it was about an elderly gardener. The gardener lives near Chernobyl, in Soviet times.
    
    The gardener dies because he’s so old. In the middle of the gardener’s funeral rites, the nearby power plant explodes. The funeral is abandoned halfway through.
    
    The gardener becomes a dybbuk, which was a kind of Jewish ghost I’d seen in a movie. He has to wander around the Earth endlessly, gardening or something, until something gets sorted out.
    
    That was as far as I’d gotten. I hadn’t actually written any of it yet.
    
    I had tried. But every time I tried I just didn’t. ‘Fifty five thou,’ I said. ‘Clean, non-sequential bills.’ ‘Fucking hell,’ my brother said.
    
    ‘That’s wonderful news,’ my brother’s wife said, ‘congratulations. You won’t need to be in London. You can help get the house in order. For the sale.’
    
    ‘Yes, good idea,’ I said, thinking about not having to pay rent anymore.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    It was the autumn and there were leaves everywhere. I decided to go back to London to get things. On the train I sat facing the wrong direction and looked out the window. The air was full of rain. I was carried backwards into it.
    
    In my flat the furniture was still there. The sofa, the television, the stereo, the gifted soft-furnishings.
    
    But when I opened the wardrobe to get a clean jumper it was empty. Or, two-thirds empty. All my girlfriend’s things had disappeared. Her dresses, blouses, skirts. Her floating light-fabricked trousers. Her multiple, heavy winter coats. I went to the dresser and checked the drawers that belonged to her.
    
    But they were empty, too. All that was left was lint, and the decrepit sprigs of lavender she believed would ward off moths.
    
    Then I noticed the bookshelves. They were also mainly empty. So was the bathroom. All the stupid and expensive houseplants had disappeared.
    
    I was surprised at how few of the things we owned together belonged to me. There were outlines of dust all around the places her things used to live.
    
    The air smelt different somehow.
    
    I looked around for a note or something. But there wasn’t one. So I tried calling her phone again and it rang once and then went silent.
    
    I went out onto the balcony for a while. The sun was setting grey.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    When I woke, it felt like someone was watching me.
    
    I sat up in bed for a second. Then I turned on the lights. But there was nobody in the room. And the curtains were closed.
    
    I noticed that in my sleep I’d built a person out of pillows next to me. Maybe so it felt as if she was still in the bed.
    
    I could feel my heart pushing my chest.
    
    When I couldn’t get back to sleep I dressed and had a drink. My girlfriend had taken some of the wine but left the spirits. After that I felt a bit better.
    
    I started packing possessions into the suitcase she hadn’t taken. It was the ugliest one. We had named it ‘Ugly Green’.
    
    By the time dawn was done I was ready to leave. I wrote an email on my phone to the estate agent saying we were vacating the flat; that they could dispose of the remaining contents, at our expense, as they saw fit.
    
    Then I tried calling her again. But it rang out.
    
    I rolled Ugly Green to the door. I turned around and began to wipe the dust outlines of her possessions from the shelves and counters and other furniture surfaces. But then I decided I did not feel like it. So I gave up.
    
    The train back to the house was half-filled with commuters, in various states of rained-on, all umbrellas and ugly laptops. They thinned out as we got further out of the city, until I was alone, in the train carriage, in the countryside.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    From the outside, once I was back at it, the house looked very empty.
    
    The plants around it seemed to have gotten bigger.
    
    There were vines growing up one of the walls. They were almost touching the glass of a ground floor window.
    
    My key was loud in the door. Nobody shouted hello.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    In the bathroom, I picked at the skin on my hand. It felt dry and funny.
    
    The skin pulled upwards, from my wrist, all the way from my palms and fingers, and then across the back of my hand. I just kept pulling, until it had come away from all my fingers and shifting hand veins. The skin came away in a single piece. It didn’t hurt. I looked at it. It looked like a glove of myself.
    
    I threw the skin into the bathtub. I turned the showerhead on and aimed at the skin and watched as it disintegrated and was carried down the drain.
    
    My brother and his wife were back in their big and increasingly valuable house in London. So I was alone in this one.
    
    It was mid-afternoon. I got drunk. Then I went to bed and slept dreamlessly.
    
     
    
    –
    
     
    
    It was almost afternoon again. I was not sure how I had slept so long.
    
    I wrote a message to my brother and his wife to confirm that I would be living in the house, ostensibly to help clear it out for the sale.
    
    I did not want to do that. But saying it would make them feel okay with me living in the house.
    
    After I wrote that message I looked at Twitter. My girlfriend had a new story out. In Guernica. She still had me blocked. But the story was all over everyone else’s Twitters. So I saw it anyway. Everyone was calling the story excellent, dark, funny, astute, etc.
    
    I opened my laptop to look at it on there. I scrolled all the way to the bottom.
    
    I didn’t recognise her new author photo. Her hair was shorter than it was. Beside the photo it said: Kei Kagirinaku is a writer from London.
    
    Downstairs, I heard the television say: the magnetic North Pole is moving increasingly towards Siberia, away from Canada. I didn’t remember turning it on.

    "text": "It was so hot that the air in the room seemed to have solidified overnight. Vera must have forgotten to set the fan running before she went to bed. Or had she tried to cook again when she got in? Her head pounded and her breathing scratched like she’d got through five packs of cigarettes, which was unfair because she didn’t smoke, not even when she was soused. Everything in the apartment glowered black and orange. Vera reached for the half empty glass of water on the other side of the bed, the only evidence that Ed had slept over. She was grateful that he wouldn’t see her like this. There are some levels of fame where everyone you date is a fan without having properly noticed you – you were just always there, already familiar.

    Her heels ached in the fluffy kitten-heel mules so she kicked them off, retrieving her secret slippers from under the bed, the ones that dragged along the floor like mutt’s ears. What this hangover needed was a Bloody Mary. Funny that Ed didn’t stay. He didn’t have work today. There was no ice in the icebox. Did it make one an alcoholic if you went and mixed one up anyway? Her drink tasted like a fortified gazpacho, but the tabasco would surely help revive her sore throat.
    
    She glanced at the hallway mirror on her way back to bed and gasped, her tumbler shattering on the terracotta tiles. Incredibly, where her neck had once been, she could now see right through to the faded paisley paper on the opposite wall. There was nothing between her chin and her shoulders. Trembling, she felt behind her chin and the skin was smooth, as if her head were a pig-skin ball. No need for tabasco, her throat had cleared.

    As Vera opened the door, Valentino skittered noisily over the imitation marble floor to meet her, sounding as if a necklace had burst with its beads rolling in every direction. No matter how polished the surroundings, you could never displace the smell of dog: dust, muck, and jelly. She rubbed his ears fondly. The designer entered from behind a velvet drape, pins held perilously between her teeth, shooing Valentino from the room.
    
    ‘Angel,’ she said, spitting out pins, ‘is it possible you’ve gotten even thinner?’ She briskly kissed the air by Vera’s ears and gestured for her to get undressed. The costumes for the Army Christmas Musical were hanging on a rail. Vera smiled as the designer pulled up the hem of a skirt to show her the stitching, sighing in pleasure as the pink chiffon floated lazily back to the ground. Looking through the other pieces, Vera gave an involuntary shudder at the white fur-trimmed red hat and cape; she hated Christmas in LA. A reminder: must phone mother later. Vera felt a dryness in her throat and gulped. She would send her mother a postcard.
    
    Vera gave a little growl and pulled away as hands reached out to untie her scarf. The designer pushed blue-tinted shades up onto her head, lit two cigarettes and held one out, waiting, ‘Did a boyfriend of yours hurt you?’ The designer (or Ms Edie in such intimate moments) understood silence as confession. ‘You know pancake can cover that. I’ll bell Dolly and have her bring some over right now. What shade are you? Twilight Tandem? Ivory Novella?’ Vera sighed like a rattlesnake and unwound her ugly scarf. She had expected the designer to faint or to scream, instead she replaced the telephone receiver calmly back on its cradle. ‘Well, Angel’ she said, gesturing at the rail of costumes, ‘these are all going to have to be redone. Thank goodness you look cute in a turtleneck!’

    Idling at the lights on Western Avenue, Vera gripped the steering wheel one-handed, the other holding an orange popsicle (lunch) that was dribbling onto her bare thighs. Just as she was about to move off a convertible screeched across the junction, manned by an invisible driver. It would have seemed like a textbook joyride, were it not for the car’s handsome passenger, familiar from the fan magazines and her boudoir the night before. What was Ed doing, laughing gaily as some jailbait hussy hurtled him round LA? Instinctively she threw the popsicle stick out of the window and followed. She and Ed weren’t ‘exclusive’ but if he was getting mixed up with delinquent kids, she didn’t have the stomach to see him anymore. No matter how useful he might be to her career. She hoped it wasn’t that.
    
    After the junction dash her quarry slowed to a canoodle. Vera bit her lip as Ed leaned down to caress the driver. How long had this been going on?
    
    ‘I make a lousy PI, but they’re so busy with each other that they’ll not notice me,’ mouthed Vera brightly to a ghost camera. Ed and his companion pulled up to a fashionable restaurant in Rodeo Drive. She felt a tug in her chest. He could have called or left a note. They had been together only last night. Had she been neglecting him so badly with the rehearsals? Ed walked round to the driver’s side door to open it and Vera almost crashed as she saw her neck hop out, wearing nothing but her grandmother’s stolen pearls.
    
     
    
    –
     
    Vera licked the salt off her asparagus and laid it neatly back on the plate. The maître d’ was laughing at something witty her neck had said, his gold tooth flashing in the sun. Although technically she was a wronged woman, she felt despicable spying on Ed like this. He looked relaxed and happy for once. Vera shaped the complimentary bread into pathetic cannonballs, stacking them up on the off-white table linen. When had they grown close? Tête-à-têtes while Vera slept? Stolen glances while she was in the shower?
    
    Her neck did a sensual little shimmy as a fluorescent lobster was set down on its plate. Ed picked up the lobster crackers and – crack! He tugged out pale-pink quivering flesh from the lobster’s claws – crack! Tossed each piece in the air and her neck caught them like a seal – crack! Ed was applauding – crack! The band started playing something frenzied. Now they were dancing! Ed was dancing. Ed! Who had always refused to dance with Vera because she was a pro. Vera stood up, bringing the tablecloth with her. The smashed crockery drew the attention of the whole restaurant. Blinkered by rage she strode towards the couple but found herself being pinned across the chest by hoodlums who had materialised from nowhere. She reached towards her neck, which gulped unmistakably then said with a phony Brooklyn accent, ‘Kindly remove this broad, I have never seen her before in my life!’
    
     
    
    –
     
    Isn’t there anything else we can do? Wrote Vera on the large notepad she now carried with her (accidentally starting a minor trend for oversized handbags).
    
    ‘Thing is,’ said LG, ‘Your neck has probably found herself a smart lawyer willing to argue that she’s not under contract to us, even if you are. Hell, she’ll probably say you forced her to work for years against her will.’
    
    Will you be replacing me in the army Christmas musical? Wrote Vera, unable to look up from the carpet.
    
    ‘With that pretty waist and those dainty hooves?! Don’t be crazy! Of course, I can’t see into the future and there may be, um, casting issues if this separation becomes permanent or word gets out about your, um, accident.’ He shrugged, stubbing his cigar out on Mary Pickford’s ceramic cheek.
    
     
    
    –
     
    Sat in her trailer, Vera iced her bloody toes. Filming had begun on the Army Christmas Musical. The designer had worked miracles with the costumes, each of them cleverly covering the well-proportioned absence between her chin and shoulders. This lack of flesh might have troubled the punters, but thankfully her co-star Rosie could fulfil the promise of a plunging neckline, and Vera was contributing a lot of leg to create visual balance. Flicking through the latest issue of Life while she waited for hair and make-up, she came across a striking full-length portrait of the neck, posed against draped satin with a worldly and sexually confident air. It was a shock to see it looking like that. When they had been together Vera’s image had been much more bobby socks and strong white teeth. Had her designer agreed to style it? Of course she had.
    
    The neck was causing a big sensation. Apparently, all the studio bosses were ringing the neck and begging it to go to expensive restaurants to discuss its career. The neck gave an interview saying that ‘musicals were dead.’ It had recently enrolled in the Actors Studio on the advice of its new friend Marlon, hoping to make an appearance in ‘something serious’ on Broadway. It had signed with United Artists. With typical consideration for others, Vera threw up in the wastepaper basket.
    
     
    
    –
     
    The most pressing question asked about the trial was who was dressed better for court. The neck had donned a demure black veil and the faintest scent of orange blossom for the occasion. Vera wished her hair a shade less ‘showgirl’ and her showgirl legs a shade less hidden by the stand. Both studios agreed that the trial was good business either way. The cat was out of the bag that the neck causing a big sensation was formerly Vera’s. Hollywood is a small town of velvet curtain-twitchers.
    
    An enthusiastic member of the Malibu Harlequins Amateur Dramatic Society, the judge demanded ‘ocular proof’ of the complainant’s abandonment. Vera unwound her scarf, moving slowly, as if pinching the tip of each finger in turn to remove long satin gloves. She heard the courthouse hold its breath, then gasp. Vera smiled reassuringly. Camera bulbs flashed.
    
    ‘It’s a trick!’ blurted a poxy youth. Frowning, the judge shuffled over to Vera and asked, ‘May I?’ passing his hand through the gap between her head and her neck, like a magician. ‘Remarkable,’ he muttered as he went back to his seat.
    
    In its defence, the neck complained bitterly of being forced to work a punishing schedule for no remuneration, of being dressed in cheap jewellery which stained it green, and fondled by the hairy fingers of studio executives. Vera’s feet would be next to skip out on her, it warned.
    
    This was all undeniably true. we were a team wrote Vera, eyes brimming pink. The neck turned away.
    
    The judge ruled in favour of the neck. It wanted its independence and had proved itself capable of gaining employment, a fiancé (Ed grinned down from the balcony), and a name for itself (Barbara Lee) in a short space of time. This was the land of the free after all. It would be wrong to force an ‘association’ which made the neck unhappy.
    
    Vera left the courthouse on LG’s arm. Rosie, Danny, and Bing, her co-stars in the Army Christmas Musical, were signing autographs, with Danny doing comical impressions of the judge, and sometimes Vera. Across the courthouse steps the neck was giving interviews, nestled comfortably against Ed’s firm chest.
    
    Moving as fast as it is possible in stilettos and a pencil skirt, Vera lunged. Grabbing it round the middle, she attempted to force the neck back on the smooth stump between her shoulders.
    
    ‘Cut it out Vera, you’re choking her!’ screamed Ed, ripping Vera’s hands away from his lover. The neck fell to the ground pitifully and Vera, blinded by tears, howled in pain.
    
     
    
    –
     
    It was horribly hot in the room. Vera felt around with her feet for her slippers; toes connecting with fur, she padded into the kitchenette. She knew that despite everything being the way it was, she wouldn’t go back home to mother. Even with a hit song, the Army Christmas Musical would probably sink like a body rolled into the reservoir. The neck was right, musicals were dead. Pulling on a mint-coloured dressing gown she went to unlock the mailbox. On principle, Vera refused to wear something that covered the gap between her head and shoulders when at home. Her neighbours were used to the sight of her head levitating above the communal swimming pool like a golden dragonfly.
    
    There was a postcard from her cousin Kate, a few items of probable fan mail, and an official-looking envelope bearing her typewritten full legal name. Vera sliced it open with a manicured nail. It was a letter from United Artists forbidding her from being on the lot at the same time as the neck. She sat down on a sun lounger and lit a cigarette. Her feet twitched.

    The girl runs in and hangs her leather bag on the hook. She pulls an apron on over her cashmere sweater, rolls up her sleeves and ties her blonde hair back into a ponytail.
    
    ‘Late again!’ her dad bellows from the kitchen. ‘One crab stick for the young black fella outside the takeaway window.’ The boy and his kind do not eat inside the cafe.
    
    She grabs the crab stick from the galley counter. It is lukewarm. Like always, she discreetly throws a few hot chips into the bottom of the bag, free of charge, and delivers it to the boy. He is sitting on a stump, drinking a hot cup of Milo. She tries not to make eye contact with him as she delivers the food.
    
    Later, the girl glances up from the fryer to check out the boy when she thinks he is not looking. She takes in the broadness of his shoulders and the tattoo of the crayfish on his arm. He wears a leather necklace of shark teeth around his neck. The wet sheen of his dark brown skin sparkles in the morning sun. Fine grains of white beach sand coat his legs and bare feet. His bodyboard is leaning on the gum tree behind him. He flicks the black curls from his eyes and scans the ocean. She is captivated by the warm, earthy hue of his soulful eyes. He meets her gaze and smiles. She quickly looks away, feeling a flush of warmth rise to her cheeks.
    
    As she drains the oil from the battered lobster tails, the girl thinks about how they charge ten times the price for a lobster roll compared to a crab stick. Lobster rolls come smothered in truffle mayo and kale slaw in a brioche bun. But, to her, lobster tastes the same as a crab stick. Her dad won’t let her eat crab sticks. They are bad for you, he says. She tries one anyway. The boy is one of the only customers who consistently orders the crab sticks.
    
    She looks outside. The boy is still there. He is surrounded by seagulls. They clamour for his chips. At a table next to the boy is a group of surfers. She has seen them before. They are out-of-town fly-in-fly-out mining workers, down from a swing. She watches as they walk back and forth to their shiny new four-wheel drives, tying their custom-made boards to the racks.
    
    The girl delivers the lobster rolls to the surfers. Her dad says they are on the house. The surfers stuff the lobster rolls into their mouths with their filthy hands, and chew with their mouths open. She looks away in disgust. They turn their attention to the surfing footage they have captured on their action cameras.
    
    ‘Would you like a lobster roll, too?’ she asks the boy. She has intentionally made an extra one.
    
    ‘No, thanks. My totem animal is the gilgie, a fresh-water cray. Lobsters are a bit like gilgies, so I won’t eat them. We don’t eat our totem animals.’
    
    ‘Fair enough,’ she says. ‘I’ll bring you some more crab sticks, then. They’re made of fish, you know. Not crabs.’
    
    ‘Totem animals! What a load of shit. It’s lobster, mate. Winners like us eat lobsters,’ says the man next to him.
    
    The girl rolls her eyes and looks out at the ocean.
    
    ‘The swell’s backing off now,’ she mutters to no one in particular.
    
    ‘It was going off this morning,’ says one of the surfers.
    
    ‘Yep, that’s just how it is,’ says another. The others nod in agreement.
    
    ‘It’s because the moon affects the tides,’ says the boy. The surfers turn their attention to him, as if they have never seen the boy before. It is the first time she has heard the boy speak to them.
    
    ‘So, you think you’re smart?’
    
    The boy doesn’t respond.
    
    ‘Mate, going to school and having smarts will get you nothin’ in life. Busting your gut up in the red dirt like us is the only way you’ll make a decent buck these days.’
    
    After her mum died of cancer, the girl was forced to quit school to help her dad out in his cafe. She wonders how the moon affects the tides, and how the tides affect the waves. Who controls the moon?
    
     
    
    The next day, the girl arrives at work with her father and there are a group of tourists waiting to enter the cafe for breakfast. She watches as they pose in front of the wall mural and wonders if they are influencers. The artwork is called The Natives, a fresco of Aboriginal people drinking beer around a campfire with native animals – kangaroos, emus, numbats, black cockatoos. As the girl rushes past to unlock the door, she hears one of them say, ‘Post it to your story!’
    
    The boy and the surfers come in from the ocean.
    
    ‘What’s with the esky lid, grom?’ the surfers taunt the boy, pointing to his bodyboard.
    
    ‘Found it on the beach.’
    
    ‘Stole it, more like it.’
    
    ‘You’re not a real surfer,’ says another. ‘Better watch your back in the line up. If you drop in on us, we’ll shred your esky lid up with our fins.’ The surfers howl with laughter and throw his bodyboard over the railing.
    
    The girl runs outside and watches as the boy sprints down the dune towards his bodyboard. It has landed on the rocks below.
    
    By the time the boy returns, the surfers have diverted their attention back to their cameras. The boy inspects his board, and she can see a large crack in the foam. He looks dismayed and sighs. She runs inside to get some duct tape and hands it to him.
    
    ‘Thanks, but I’m gonna let it dry out for a bit then I’ll patch it up with some glue,’ he says. ‘It’s not the first time this has happened.’ She lightly traces the intricate web of repaired cracks in his board.
    
    ‘Some of the cracks are caused by me. The sea can get rough. I normally throw a handful of sand into the ocean before a session, so the Waugul comes down to protect me whilst I’m out there.’
    
    ‘I’ve seen you do that.’
    
    ‘You been watching me?’ he asks, teasingly.
    
    She nods.
    
    ‘Solid,’ he says, with a wink.
    
    ‘You know, you should report them to the police if they keep harassing you,’ she says in a low voice, gesturing towards the surfers.
    
    ‘I want to be a cop one day,’ he says.
    
    ‘For real?’
    
    ‘Yep. I want to help my people from the inside. They think I’m a traitor for wanting to be a cop. They say I’m too wadjela – too white.’
    
    ‘I want to be Taylor Swift,’ she says wistfully. The boy laughs at this.
    
    ‘That’s deadly,’ he says.
    
    ‘Oi! Get away from that boy and get your arse back in the kitchen!’ her dad yells.
    
    ‘Sorry,’ the girl mouths silently at the boy as she skulks back inside.
    
    The next day, the boy doesn’t turn up. Or the day after. Or the day after that. Each day the girl arrives and looks over at his empty stump stool with disappointment. She scans the waves and the beach for the boy. He is nowhere to be seen but hiding in every corner of her mind.
    
    A couple of weeks later, the girl visits her local library. She searches for books on bush tucker food. She wants to convince her dad to revise the cafe menu to include saltbush and lemon myrtle calamari, wallaby dumplings and wattle seed damper.
    
    As she searches for the books, she’s surprised to find the boy sitting at a nearby desk. She watches him quietly for a short moment, before finding her voice.
    
    ‘Hey, Gilgie,’ she says, tentatively.
    
    ‘Kaya! That means hello in Noongar language.’
    
    ‘Kaya. I haven’t seen you around the cafe lately.’
    
    ‘Nah, I’ve been studying for exams.’ He stands up to join her next to the bookshelf.
    
    ‘What are you looking for?’ he asks, looking at the shelf behind her.
    
    ‘Bush tucker books.’
    
    He leans over her and pulls a book from the shelf. ‘What about this one?’
    
    He is so close now she can smell the woody scent of his deodorant, and the watermelon vape on his breath. She watches the steady pulse of his jugular vein and imagines what it would feel like to kiss his neck.
    
    ‘I got you something,’ he says.
    
    ‘Me?’
    
    ‘Yeah, I was gonna give it to you after exams, but since you’re here I can give it to you now.’ He reaches into his backpack and pulls out a friendship bracelet. The beads spell out the word F.E.A.R.L.E.S.S.
    
    His hand touches hers as he gives her the bracelet. An electric current shoots up her arm. He leaves his hand there for a moment. It feels warm and soft like a cozy blanket on a chilly day.
    
    ‘Coz you’re a Swiftie!’ he says.
    
    ‘Thank you. I love it,’ she says as she puts it on her wrist. She sleeps with it on that night. She never takes it off.
    
    The girl waits forever for the boy to return to the cafe. She wonders how many exams he has. When she thinks about him, the sun shines brighter, the salt air feels crisper, the beach daisies look more yellow. She wears a push up bra and a low-cut top, much to the admiration of the surfers. But it is not their attention she seeks. She paints her nails bright pink, applies lipstick every day and plays Taylor Swift music loudly. She sings the words ‘But with you I’d dance in a storm / In my best dress / Fearless!’
    
    ‘Turn that shit down!’ her father shouts.
    
    Finally, she sees the boy walking up the beach stairs. He is smiling straight at her.
    
    ‘Oh, look! The prodigal esky lidder has returned,’ a surfer jibes, ditching a plastic bottle at him.
    
    The boy ignores the surfer without breaking eye contact with the girl.
    
    ‘Hey, Swiftie.’
    
    ‘Kaya, Gilgie.’
    
    ‘Exams are done.’
    
    ‘Great! How do you think they went?’
    
    ‘I think I did alright. I also applied for a cadet traineeship with the Western Australian Police.’
    
    ‘Wow, that’s awesome. It’s good to see you again.’
    
    ‘You too. You’re still wearing the bracelet I gave you.’
    
    ‘Yeah.’ She coyly twists the bracelet around her wrist and looks up at the boy. He is looking down at the bracelet with a lopsided grin. She watches as his gaze veers to her chest.
    
    A thunderstorm is rolling in. Lightning flashes across the horizon. The sky darkens and rumbles. A curlew takes flight, filling the air with a haunting wail. She must get the chairs and tables inside.
    
    ‘Oi! Grom! Come ‘ere,’ a surfer calls out. The boy looks around and hesitantly makes his way over to the group.
    
    ‘Sit down and have a lobster roll with us,’ the man instructs.
    
    ‘No, thank you,’ the boy responds, keeping his eyes fixed to the ground. The man ignores him and tells the girl to make another lobster roll. The girl starts frying up some crab sticks instead of lobster tails. She keeps a watchful eye on them.
    
    As she delivers the lobster roll to the table, she subtly nods to the boy. She is not sure he understands she has swapped the filling to crab.
    
    ‘Eat it,’ instructs the man. The boy brings the roll to his mouth and hesitates.
    
    ‘What, you don’t like lobster?’ the man says with a smirk.
    
    ‘EAT, EAT, EAT,’ the surfers chant, banging their fists on the table.
    
    ‘I said eat it!’ the man yells as he smashes the roll into the boy’s face. Bits of crab stick, kale slaw and brioche bread fly across the table. The seagulls swoop down fighting for the scraps.
    
    ‘Wait, what the hell is this?’ the man asks, picking up a piece of crab stick. The man glances across at the girl in the kitchen.
    
    ‘Righto, let’s step it up,’ he says turning back to the boy. ‘Time for you to go for a swim!’ The surfers jeer as they carry the boy down the beach stairs towards the ocean.
    
    The girl runs out of the kitchen and follows them. A gale whips at her dress. Her hair lashes her cheeks. The sand stings her legs.
    
    ‘Let him go! He’ll die out there!’ she screams. They ignore her, pushing the boy and a surfboard into a dinghy with them. Amidst the roar of the wind and crash of waves, she can hear the boy protesting. She momentarily watches from beneath the shelter of a limestone cliff until they are out past the steep crest line of waves, bereft that she cannot help him. She runs back up to the cafe to tell her dad what has happened. He shrugs and flips another burger. ‘Get back to work,’ he says. She calls the police, then runs back down to the beach.
    
    Minutes later, the dinghy returns to shore with the surfers but no boy. She imagines him out there by himself. The fury of the ocean. Sharks. Her tears mix with the rain and salt spray, and she cannot tell the difference. She throws a handful of sand into the sea.
    
    ‘Gilgie!’ The wind drowns out her voice.
    
     
    
    Days turn into weeks. The girl surveys the ocean for signs of the boy. She walks along the shoreline looking for broken pieces of board. There is nothing. Nobody notices the boy is gone. It’s as if he didn’t exist. She grieves for him. The surfers come and go, eating their lobster rolls. She paints over the mural.
    
    ‘I’m leaving. I’m going back to school,’ she tells her father one day. ‘And I’m going to sing,’ she adds.
    
    ‘Fair dinkum. You’ve got rocks in your head, girl.’
    
    She ignores him.
    
    ‘I don’t want to cook lobsters anymore. Their numbers are declining, and we’re destroying their habitat. It just doesn’t feel right anymore.’
    
    Her father looks bewildered. She leaves and doesn’t look back.
    
    After school one day, the girl walks through the hospital wards, pausing now and then to serenade the patients with songs. This is her new job. Her eyes fall on a familiar tattoo etched onto the arm of a patient. A small crayfish.
    
    ‘Gilgie?’ she calls out to him.
    
    ‘Swiftie!’
    
    ‘You’re alive!’ She reaches down and embraces him. He winces and she takes a step back, afraid that she has hurt him.
    
    ‘The Waugul saved me,’ he declares. ‘The Rainbow Serpent.’
    
    ‘For real?’ she asks, imagining the giant, colourful sea-snake carrying Gilgie safely to shore. ‘Are you okay?’
    
    ‘Yeah. Feeling a bit crook. Broke my leg and hit my head. I was in a coma. Still got a bit of a headache, aye.’
    
    ‘I’m just glad you’re alive, Gilgie.’
    
    ‘It’s Ethan. My wadjela name is Ethan.’
    
    ‘I’m Grace.’
    
    An awkward pause settles between them as they stare at each other like they are meeting for the first time. No longer under the sharp shadows of others. Free of the weight of histories untold. She sees only the soft glow of possibilities now.
    
    ‘Would you like me to bring you some crab sticks tomorrow?’ she asks him.
    
    A smile spreads across his face.
    
    ‘I reckon scallops might be better from now on. If that’s okay? Will you share them with me?’
    
    Grace loves the delicate sweetness of scallops. They are pricier than crab sticks, but he is worth it.
    
    ‘Absolutely. I’d love that, Gilgie. I’ll bring you scallops every day, if you want. Whatever you need to help you heal, just let me know.’
    
    ‘Just you, Grace. I just need you.’
    
    She leans down and kisses him gently. Sealing the beginning of their journey together. Carrying the legacy of their two worlds. Bound by love and hope.

    "text": "‘There goes dinner,’ Nina says.

She stares at the broken shards on the floor. Was it hand-painted? Nina wonders, admiring her own plate – part of the same set. The blue brushstrokes against the white ceramic, the flower in the centre and the figs dancing along the rim. Must have been.

She massages her temples before surveying the table. Emma, at one end, returns her stare, though their camaraderie – if there ever was any – is long gone. Aldo, at the other, scratches at the glass table with his finger and mutters to himself, words somewhere between fuck and stupid and respect. Toby’s vacant stare falls on the rolling Tuscan landscape.

This is supposed to be a holiday, but even here, Nina is languishing, withering. Dread crawls across her chest, wrapping its long claws around her back. She’s been forcing herself out of bed these past few months, and it’s been the same here, out and on to the poolside lounger. Poor Nina.

‘I want to go home,’ Nina announces, though no one responds.

At home, Nina knows how to tweeze the rot from her heart. Singing with Ramon, a twenty-one-year-old with a handlebar moustache who sits up so straight it’s as if his spine is a maestro’s baton, and who’s raised her vocal range by five notes and her spirits an octave. Throwing clay at the pottery studio near her flat. Hugging her nephew, each roll in his fat little arms like a crease in a boiled dumpling. But she’s stuck here in Florence, at the silent dinner table, staring at the broken plate on the floor.

She looks out at the enormous cypress trees lining the thick wall of Aldo’s parents’ holiday home, and behind them the Florentine hills. No, Nina is trapped. No Ramon, no nephew and no clay, unless she sticks her hands into the dirt, but why would she do that? Her manicure cost forty pounds.

Toby fiddles with his fork, prodding at the tines, and then moves it across the glass to poke Nina’s knife, disrupting the parallel lines of her cutlery. His playful gesture annoys her. Is he insane? He used to call her beautiful, used to kiss her breasts, lick her nipples, rub his face along her upper thigh. He said it so often that after a while Nina believed him. Now, she doesn’t really care what he thinks, or tries her best not to.

Nina and Toby were never that serious. They never had conversations about not sleeping with other people. For that, Nina feels both disappointed and unentitled to that disappointment. Nina can’t bear it. The animus, the cracked plate, Aldo and Emma’s ugly faces, Toby’s pretty one. Just as she’s about to combust, the oven dings. The lasagne.

She rises, her wooden chair scraping against the sandstone tile, and walks inside the house – too modern, a little gaudy – to take the dish out of the oven. She lets it rest on the counter while she finds a dustpan and brush beneath the marble sink.

When Nina returns, Toby tries to help her, or perhaps more accurately, crouches beside her as she sweeps. Rather than relieving her of her tools – actually being useful – he fiddles with a fragment, picking it up running his finger along the broken edge.

‘Ow!’

Toby drops the shard, which cracks into two.

‘Are you okay?’ Emma asks, pushing back from her chair, a desperate rumble vibrating off its legs.

‘I’m fine,’ he says.

All for show, Nina thinks as she draws the debris into the dustpan. All for fucking show.

As Toby latches on to his finger, attempting to suck the wound dry, Nina notices the drop of blood now staining his white trousers. She feels a hollowing out and her mind drags her back to the drop of blood she once saw on his sheets.

‘What’s this?’ Nina had asked, still naked, pointing to the round stain pressed into the linen.

‘Oh, it’s um . . .’ Toby had mumbled. ‘I’m sorry.’

With that apology, Nina plummeted.

‘Whose is it?’

‘It’s . . . I don’t know,’ Toby said, because he didn’t. ‘Sorry.’

Why didn’t he just lie?  Say that he scratched a scab in his sleep. He could’ve said something else – anything else – but sorry. Nina imagined Toby having sex with a woman who wasn’t her. Fucking her on the bed, on her period, leaving a spot of blood behind and caring too little to change the sheets before he next saw Nina.

‘Are you upset?’ Toby had asked.

‘I’m upset.’

‘But—’

‘I know, Toby.’

With that, she’d left his flat, her body swollen with regret. Regret for failing to keep it to herself, for asking questions she didn’t want the answer to. When Nina first learned that Toby had started sleeping with Emma, Nina was reminded that she was the architect of her own suffering.

‘It couldn’t be less serious,’ Emma had said.

Nina acted as if she didn’t care – she was a fool who swallowed her own reality whole.

Why does Nina do this? Circle her own life like a vulture. She thought she’d healed, at least enough to be on holiday with him. And with her. But Toby’s a fucking child. She hates him! She does. But when he releases his finger from his mouth to look at it, it’s with an innocence that charms from her a desire to kiss it better, to consume him, but only for a moment before the anger returns. She shakes her head, and he turns his face as if she slapped him.

Nina takes the shards inside, and Toby follows two steps behind her. She hears her therapist in her head: sit with the emotion, examine it, question if there are other places you have felt it.

Do I love him or the idea of him? Nina asks herself. Or are they the same?

‘I’m sorry,’ Toby says to Nina in the kitchen.

Nina ignores him, sweeping the debris into the bin, and when Toby moves to touch her shoulder she jerks it toward her neck. His hand recoils and Toby feels a puncture he can’t locate. He retreats to the bathroom in the far recesses of the house, beyond what the glass walls expose to the table outside.

 

Toby shakes his hand, a perfect circle of blood falling on the tiles. He mummifies his finger in toilet paper before rifling through the cabinet beneath the sink. He finds a plaster, taking longer than he needs to. All he wants to do is buy some time, minutes away from people who pair forgiveness with resentment. Nobody hates him more than Aldo, still angry that Toby followed his dreams while Aldo couldn’t hack it – always spewing big talk at Toby about how he wants to be a provider, which makes Toby angry but also makes him want to laugh, because Aldo’s wife fucking left him.

Provide for whom? Fucking moron.

Sitting on the toilet, he thinks about Nina. He really liked Nina. Still likes, even. And he followed the rules, in that there weren’t many rules, and if someone else doesn’t set the rules then how can he follow them?

One night they watched a movie called Boiling Point, set in a restaurant near his flat in Hackney. He remembers a female patron saying that sex was like food, you work with what’s there, not with what’s not, and how he and Nina laughed. Nina’s body had been different to other women he’d slept with, but it was pleasurable all the same. With Nina, Toby wasn’t in search of just sensation, but of feeling, too, and that scared him. It scared him so much that when he thought about how sex was like food, he questioned if what the woman in that movie should’ve said is that no cuisine offers everything you want, which means dipping your cock into as many cuisines as possible.

So he began to fuck around, even though he knew Nina wasn’t, and no matter how much he ate he found himself hungry. Even when he was with Emma, the difference in Emma’s body didn’t feel as great as he’d hoped, lovely as it was, and it scared him again, to know, undeniably, that for him Nina was much more than sex.

When Nina had asked him about the blood on his sheets, Toby watched something in her crack. He felt guilty. He wasn’t lying – if he’d hazarded a guess it would’ve only been with the certainty attained from a balance of probabilities – but he felt wrong, and even worse for knowing the blood could’ve been Emma’s.

Emma told Nina that she was sleeping with Toby, though only sometime after Toby and Nina had ended things, and with no indication of the overlap between them.

‘She seemed fine,’ Emma said to Toby.

This both surprised and disappointed him, and so he chose not to believe it.

Emma and Toby didn’t last long. The guilt ate at Toby – it eats at him right now. He hates himself – a lot – for being the kind of person people say he is. Can’t prioritise, can’t think about other people. Can’t promise, because promising means disappointing people, means falling short. Nina once said that when we act from a place of fear, we secure the outcomes we were trying to avoid in the first place. Toby thinks about that a lot, about how much he loses because he’s a coward.

Clearly, he doesn’t lose enough. Nina is here. Emma is here. Everyone forgives him. They forgive his lack of promises and accept his vague attempts to do better. And maybe if they look hard enough, Toby is doing better, but he knows that people will always wait, and that strips the journey of urgency. Maybe if he’d been honest, about sleeping with Emma, about the overlap, then none of them would be here. The plate would’ve stayed intact, untouched in the kitchen cabinet, and they could’ve each dealt with their broken selves much closer to home. But Nina would’ve been so hurt, even if she’d try her best to hide it, and Toby hadn’t wanted to do that to her. Honesty would’ve lost her, right?

Toby notices that the plaster has soaked through with blood. He replaces it with a larger one before walking back through the house. Emma’s glare is on him as he comes into view from behind the glass doors. It’s as if she could see him through the walls, wrapping his finger in the bathroom. Before this evening, before the batshit drama, Toby had thought it was wonderful that he could be on holiday with Emma and Nina, and for everything to be okay. Silly, really.

‘Are you okay?’ Nina asks, still in the kitchen.

Toby nods, holding up his wrapped finger.

‘You?’

‘No, Toby.’

 

From outside, Emma watches the movement in Toby’s jaw, unable to discern his words. She knows he’s talking to Nina, even though she’s hidden behind the curtain. She turns to Aldo, who scowls at the horizon as if the dipping sun is to blame. Emma rolls her eyes.

Why did Nina laugh? Emma wonders, thinking about Nina sniggering while Aldo said all those horrible things to her, right before he threw the plate. Is that what they think of me?

Emma rests her head on table and looks down at her dusty feet. It’s not that she hates Nina, it’s just that Nina’s a little serious, isn’t she? Emma used to feel superior, knowing that Nina will forever aspire to things that for Emma are God-given. After all, what else can she feel superior to Nina for? Her wit? Emma has never been funny, and whenever she tries it comes off as mean, though she doesn’t intend it to. And Emma knows relying on beauty for comfort is a pillow stuffed with misery, of limp feathers, and the deeper her head sinks, the more it decays the bones in her neck. She knew it more than anything after her ex-boyfriend Dave cheated on her, throwing away seven years and a shared group of friends for the thrill of something new. Can you believe it? The heartless cunt. When Emma saw a picture of the woman, the one Dave fucked in their bedroom, the one who posts pictures of charcuterie boards with hot honey and salami roses, Emma’s first thought was: She’s not even that pretty.

It was then that Emma had come to a realisation that, in this moment, with her head on the table, she returns to: while beauty attracts interest, it doesn’t sustain it, and no matter how beautiful she is, how genetically predisposed she is to perfect hair, a narrow waist or an angelic face, none of it will shield her from pain. Dave, in his own way, said that this was part of the issue: that Emma surrendered herself to the church of optimisation, to hip thrusts at Barre, believing that the soul of a relationship rests in the self and not in the relative. Well, not quite like that. Dave was never good with words.

Emma tries to scratch an itch in the arch of her foot with the opposing big toe.

Feet are disgusting.

Emma feels ashamed. About everything. Sure, her paintings – nude self-portraits – are still selling, and selling for a lot, but is there anything really there? Emma doesn’t know.

Maybe Aldo’s right. Maybe the only reason people – all those rich men – buy her paintings is because they can’t buy her body, so they settle on purchasing its proxy pressed onto canvas. Even though she couches each nude in thematic narratives of hope, pathos, or, as Nina might put it, rotting, she worries these paragraphs are afterthoughts to the panicked desire to preserve her beauty in oil, linseed and turpentine. Emma doesn’t know what will happen when she wilts, when the flower moves past its season.

Emma is a little miserable. But so is everyone else, she tells herself. Nina was born hating herself, and no hobby or man will fix that; Toby has the emotional literacy of a nine-year-old; and Aldo reminds her of her father, which is sad, because at least her dad waited until sixty to become so bitter and hateful. For a while, after Dave, Emma’s misery found a home in Toby. She didn’t feel bad about Nina, at least at first, because if Nina and Toby lacked clear boundaries then it wasn’t Emma’s fault. And if Nina found out, she would just have to grow up and be an adult. But Emma’s heart doesn’t rest so easy. She is not the woman she wants to be – the liberated artist selling nudes of herself without care, taking lovers who have other lovers. She lifts her head off the table.

Where is Toby?

She looks at Aldo, who’s now picking at the skin at the side of his nails. Toby moves out of view and toward Nina, and Emma finds herself walking towards the open glass door.  When she reaches the kitchen she sees Toby hugging Nina with her arms flat at her side. Emma feels exactly like Nina did when she spotted the blood on Toby’s sheets.

‘Leaving me alone,’ Aldo calls from the table. ‘Real fucking nice.’

Emma’s head swings back towards the table.

‘Are you fucking kidding?’ she asks. ‘Did you want a fucking hug?’

Emma looks back at Toby, who has let Nina go, and she thinks of the first time she slept with him, after they’d taken shrooms dissolved in whisky and walked around the Tate Modern like dickheads from a Ben Lerner novel. Later that day, Emma had thought of Nina while Toby fucked her in bed. Isn’t that fucked? Thinking about the other girl he was fucking. Her friend. But Emma wondered how Nina’s body felt in comparison to her own. And she asked him what it was like having sex with Nina, what it was like to have sex with a trans woman. She couldn’t resist, and she asked in a way that implied that she might like to have sex with Nina, too. And who knows, maybe part of Emma did want to fuck Nina, but lying in Toby’s unwashed sheets, all she wanted to know was how she compared to her friend, because Emma needed to feel safer, to know that the essence of her edged Nina out, and that all the other stuff – being, personality, charm – was just white noise that clouded the fundamentals.

‘It’s different but the same,’ Toby had said. ‘It’s sex. You work with what’s there, not with what’s not.’

When he’d said that, Emma had decided to pretend, to tell him what he’d said was beautiful, and she kissed Toby on the lips and realised that she didn’t really love or even like him all that much. She didn’t desire his body but the dialogue of his against hers, utterances that she was somehow worthy, forming wedges between her and Dave, who had slept with the girl who wasn’t that pretty.

She remembers going through Aldo’s wedding photos with Nina. There was a picture of them walking, Nina a few steps ahead. Emma saw Nina’s face fall. Those few steps made Nina look much taller, that much broader than Emma.

‘Don’t be silly,’ Emma had said. ‘You look fine.’

‘Yeah.’

‘I wish I was as tall as you,’ she continued, although she couldn’t look Nina in the eye. ‘I’d feel so powerful.’

Now Emma can’t look at Toby either, although for different reasons. Nina walks past Emma, arms brushing, back towards Aldo outside.

‘The plate’s in the bin,’ Nina says.

Aldo, for the first time since the plate hit the floor, looks at her. He stares. Wordless. Nina rolls her eyes and sits on a sun lounger by the long, cerulean pool, looking out at the view in silence.

Fucking bitch, Aldo thinks.

 

Aldo’s insides are still cooking. They’ve been cooking since he threw the plate. He’s disintegrating into a hateful stew. He scrunches his fist and squeezes one into the other, as if the force could crumble them, but even if it could he knows it’d just be salt in the soup.

Fuck Toby. And fuck Nina and Emma. Those fucking bitches. Fucking stupid bitches.

Aldo might have a problem with women. Has he always had a problem with women? Well, haven’t most – all – men had a problem with women? The divorce has made things worse, and if the only woman on Earth was Vivian, his ex-wife, it might not be a crime to assume that women were terrible. Emma. Maybe he shouldn’t have been so hard on Emma. There should’ve – could’ve – been some solidarity there, after what happened with her and Dave, and with him and Vivian. Maybe calling them bitches is misogynistic. But they really are bitches, aren’t they? Do they really get a free pass because they’re women?

Divorce has been hard on Aldo. Especially divorce at thirty-two. Getting married at twenty-seven was weird, and a woman who is pregnant in her early thirties is basically a teen mum, so of course Vivian was still secretly on the pill even though they were supposed to be trying. He was so angry about the pill. Angrier about that than the cheating. He wanted kids. Badly. It was part of the plan. Work hard, buy a house, have kids, because when you have kids you’re golden. Sex with your partner will have grown stale, anyway, but that love you once had for your wife evolves into something more meaningful, spilling over onto those little versions of you, who will consume so much, require so much of you, so that the fact that you’ve fallen out of love with your partner will matter less and less and less.

Vivian was cunning. Vengeful. On their first date, she told Aldo she discovered her flatmate was using her expensive shampoo – Olaplex, Aldo later learned, as he scoured the labels in her shower – and so she emptied the bottles and filled them with mayonnaise. When he first told Nina about it, Nina, who is Chinese, asked if Vivian was, too.

‘How did you know?’ he’d asked her.

Nina shrugged her shoulders.

‘Obvious.’

Maybe from that point on he should’ve known that Vivian would take whatever she could get her hands on, and in this case it was half the proceeds from the house, even though he (his parents) had provided all the deposit and paid most of the mortgage. Not because she’s Chinese – deep down, he can’t be sure that has anything to do with it – but because she is cunning and vengeful. She has no friends from her childhood.

‘I’m sorry, Aldo,’ Emma had said when he’d told her about the affair and the pill, his focus heavy on the pill. She’d put her head on his shoulder and rubbed her hand along his back. ‘We always thought she was the kind of girl who got a kick out of not being a girl’s girl, which is a really bad sign.’

How nice it was for Emma to have Aldo and for Aldo to have Emma, at least until now. Emma had reminded Aldo that there were right people and wrong people. Right: Aldo and Emma. Wrong: Vivian and Dave. This had made Aldo feel good – very good – so good in fact that he began to parrot Emma’s words.

‘She’s the kind of girl who gets a kick out of not being a girl’s girl,’ he would tell friends, and family, and even colleagues, until it elicited enough odd looks for him to stop.

Toby walks out the house and towards the pool.

Fucking prick, Aldo thinks, glaring at him as he takes the chair next to Nina. Stupid Toby. Fucking Toby.

Why are people so fucking obsessed with Toby? Isn’t that why Aldo threw the plate in the first place? To think they were once a partnership, too, years ago. A comedy duo – sketches, stand-up, you name it. To think they wrote and performed together, until Aldo decided that it was time to get real and shed his sense of humour and become a banker, whereas Toby decided their life was in fact real and that maybe he could really make it work. And Toby did make it work. Sort of. Filmed a BBC pilot with potentially more to come. Aldo would be lying if he said he hoped it’d all work out.

Aldo thinks of the illustration Toby used to show him, the one with two men digging separate tunnels. One of them gives up, though, unbeknownst to him, all that separates him and a clutch of diamonds are a few swings of a pick. The other man keeps swinging on. Was that Aldo and Toby? How utterly unpalatable that would be. How unbearable. It felt to Aldo like he and Toby’s life decisions were two ends of a seesaw, a zero-sum game. But at least Aldo can provide. What the fuck can the others do? Toby works when he can. Emma locks herself in a studio and knows nothing about the real world. Nina seems to make it up as she goes along. They do what they want, and nothing seems to matter. But Aldo cares about duty and responsibility, so much so that he cried when the Queen died, because, in his eyes, she lived a life shaped by those ideals.

‘What the fuck did the Queen do for you, Aldo?’ Vivian once asked, glowering.

He impressed on her then that it was important to give yourself to something bigger, and by that he implied that he was giving himself to her, their life together. That’s why he quit a job he loved for a job he hated, because if you believe in servitude enough then love falls out of the question, and that in some ways is a relief, until it isn’t.

People are ungrateful. Vivian was ungrateful, and so are these motherfuckers. He gives them a holiday and they can’t even cut him some slack. So what if he snapped at Emma for cutting the nose off the brie? Something Emma herself had once told him not to do. What right did Nina have to interject?

‘Aldo,’ her palm had smacked lightly on the table. ‘You’ve been acting like a dick since we got here. We’re supposed to be on holiday.’

‘Oh fuck off, Nina. It’s my fucking house,’ he replied, although his parents would be quick to remind him that it’s not his fucking house. ‘I’m going through a lot.’ And as the three of them looked away from him, at the table, he saw disbelief in their faces. ‘If you knew the first thing about love then maybe you’d understand.’

‘What the fuck is that supposed to mean?’ Nina snapped.

‘Well, Nina,’ Aldo said. ‘You’ve never been in a serious relationship. Your entire existence is fleeting encounters because nobody in their right mind would commit to you, and it all works out for you, because you can write another essay about being trans and the intersection of love, fertility and transness, even though there are probably millions of trans women living perfectly normal lives with loving partners and children, and the problem is, Nina, is that you are probably just a little bit fucked in the head, and you’re so used to profiting from how fucked in the head you are that—’

‘Aldo!’ Toby shouted, matching Nina’s palm on the table with his fist.

‘What the fuck is wrong with you?’ Emma screamed, all while Nina’s shoulders rose and her jaw tightened. Silence fell upon them, and Emma continued. ‘All your fucking digs. Why do you even hang out with us?’

‘Well, I thought you were my friends,’ Aldo said, feeling sorry for himself.

‘I think you just like being around artists,’ Emma muttered. ‘But the more time I spend with you the more I realise you don’t know the first thing about creating art. You aren’t an artist. You haven’t ever been an artist. You’re just a city cunt who likes being around actual art—’

‘Art?!’ Aldo shouted. ‘Art?! Is that what you think you fucking do, Emma? Your ridiculous paintings of your tits that are somehow about neoliberalism?’

And then Nina let out chuckle, which did not go unnoticed by Aldo or Toby, and especially not by Emma, who looked at Nina, face twisted like a Francis Bacon portrait. Now that was talent.

‘Seriously,’ Aldo snarled. ‘How many times do you have to paint your pussy to get why Dave cheated on you?’

‘Aldo!’ Toby interjected,

Nina stayed quiet. Emma crossed her nail into the mosquito bite on her arm.

Is this what they think of me?

Toby’s head fell towards his hands. Everything was going wrong.

‘You’re all fucking useless,’ Aldo continued. ‘What are you going to do when your face and body hit the wall, Emma?’

‘The wall? . . .’ she asked, hands splayed either side of her. ‘The wall?! Are we on fucking 4-chan?!’

‘Yeah, the fucking wall.’ Aldo stood up. ‘In a few years, when someone younger, better and hotter comes along, people are going to forget you, because when it comes down to it, people have painted pussies for years, and yours just aren’t that good.’

Emma stood up. Toby pointed at Aldo.

‘That’s eno—’

‘That’s enough, Aldo,’ jeered Aldo, returning the finger, only drawing Toby further out of his seat. He turned to Nina.

‘Do you know he was fucking you both at the same time?’

She didn’t nod or shake her head, she only pursed her lip, but Aldo wanted more.

‘Did you hear that?’ he said. ‘He was fucking you and her at the—’

‘Shut up!’ Toby shouted.

‘Fuck you!’ Aldo screamed, and then like a reflex, he reached for his plate and threw it at the floor. The ceramic split. Heads turned in unison to stare at the shards on the patio.

In silence, the others joined Nina in sitting down around the table, unsure of where to go once the unretractable had been said. There was no point in putting it back together – any meal from it would just make them question if their art was terrible, if they knew nothing of love, duty or sacrifice, and if they were just angry people who threw plates.

‘There goes dinner,’ Nina said."

    "text": "I thought she would change, but my wife continued to ogle men on the street. Me, I don’t have that kind of confidence. Even if I’m expected to stare at women, in person or on a screen, that’s not the kind of marriage I want. My wife once said I was like a boy she used to know who refused to laugh when the teacher said penis. ‘Do you think that’s normal?’ she asked.

My wife almost always came home after I was asleep. She would take a shower and get into bed. Even on Saturdays she said she had to work. ‘Why are you wearing that?’ I shouted once. ‘It’s a red dress. Why wear that to the office?’

‘Don’t you think I look good?’ she replied. When I didn’t answer she said, ‘You don’t tell someone what to wear!’

I went and stood in front of the apartment door.

She put her hands behind her back and started hopping to prove her breasts wouldn’t fall out. ‘See?’

For days following that, I couldn’t concentrate at work. When the time came to head home, I was reluctant to leave.

I began exercising three times a week for two hours at a time. I thought if I didn’t have money then at least I could look strong. I wasn’t overweight, but I wasn’t in good shape either, and often when I pushed myself on the treadmill the sincerity of my efforts would move me to think that I deserved more respect from my wife.

Coming home, I would drape my sweaty shirt on the sofa so she would see my hard work. I would cook dinner despite my sore muscles, feeling ridiculous gripping the knife or the frying pan with both hands. I would work as fast as I could, afraid that she would suddenly come home and see me fumble.

All of this was exhausting, and each time I cooked I swore I wouldn’t do it again. But the following evening would find me standing in the kitchen, lifting the chopping board from the drying rack, and washing my hands.

One evening, as I stepped out of the shower, I was shocked when both ends of the towel effortlessly overlapped around my waist. I wiped the steam off the mirror and looked at myself. I looked amazing.

I called my wife. ‘Are you nearly home? It’s almost dinner time.’

‘Eating out tonight,’ she said.

‘Do you think it’s healthy? You being out late so often,’ I said, although I didn’t want to imply that I was accusing her of something.

‘I’m fine,’ she said.

‘Are you sure?’

‘Why would I not be?’

Hearing this, I took deep breaths. I pictured myself doing the dishes later but didn’t have the guts to tell her I was unhappy. I started walking around the apartment shirtless. As I passed the window, I thought I was bringing joy to lonely housewives who might see me.

 

 

On the side of a double-decker bus I saw an ad for a fortune teller named Raymond. He had a really large nose. I called him from work – I wanted to know if things would improve.

‘Yup,’ was how he answered the phone. I’d phoned at a perfect time, he said, and chuckled to himself. He was just about to go to bed.

The fact that it was 9 a.m. and he said it so casually made me think he lived a better life than I could imagine.

‘Is something weighing on you?’ he asked.

Tears welled up. I couldn’t speak. Sounding impatient, he told me to come see him at a mall.

The mall was small with little foot traffic. It didn’t take long for me to spot him beside a cardboard booth next to the escalators. He was in a wheelchair, staring at a couple with a baby stroller arguing outside the toilet.

I suddenly regretted coming and tried to leave but he’d already noticed me.

‘You were staring,’ he said. I quickly apologized.

‘A wheelchair is a magnet,’ he said, smacking the wheels. ‘Attracts a lot of attention, which is a form of energy, which can be manipulated to serve you.’

He laughed. I didn’t know what to say.

All of a sudden he hopped up. I saw he was short and pudgy. ‘Are you offended?’

‘No. No.’ I was in shock.

‘Lesson one: anything can happen. So my question: how are you preparing?’

‘I’m not sure,’ I answered. I was smiling from nervousness. I thought he was crazy and I was stupid to come to see him.

‘Don’t worry,’ he said. ‘Luck can make even the weakest man indestructible. If you’re lucky, someone can shoot you in the face, and you’d still live.’

I reached for my cheek.

‘I’m speaking metaphorically.’ I kept smiling.

‘When was the last time you felt lucky?’

I told him about finding a dollar coin on my jogging route and how after that I had looked for coins every time I went jogging. I tried to laugh because it sounded depressing.

He reached for my arm.

Squeezing it, he said, ‘Today you have gotten lucky.’

 

 

I went home that day with a plastic bag of feng shui items – urns, crystals, wind chimes, and a Laughing Buddha figurine. Raymond said the Buddha would bring joy and abundance to my life. To attain them I had to rub its pot belly before starting the day.

I did this the next morning, and then every morning after that. Then I would make breakfast, which tasted better because I was hopeful.

‘Would you like something to eat?’ I asked my wife one morning. ‘It depends,’ she replied, putting away her phone. ‘What are you making? I have a meeting later, I can’t be late for work.’ I brought her two slices of toast.

When she thanked me, smiling, it felt like the Buddha had done its work. I returned to the kitchen, which was pleasantly bright, and started wiping down the counter.

After a while, she came in. ‘Since when are you spiritual?’ She gestured to the Buddha. ‘I’d rather you not waste money on knick-knacks. You’re a grown man.’

I felt my stomach clench. I tried to think.

She came closer. ‘Can I take it to the office instead?’ she said, softly, resting her hand on my chest. ‘My boss is British. He loves this kind of oriental shit.’

I frowned.

‘Please?’

‘Why do you always do this?’ I snapped, and she pulled away. I immediately grew nervous because I knew I had angered her. I looked past her into the living room: the toast was gone.

‘This man pays the salary that pays our bills. Don’t you think it’s wise to make him happy?’

‘Will you come home early then?’ I pointed to the television. ‘When was the last time we watched a movie?’

She shaped her fingers into a gun and mimed blowing her brains out.

‘This is such a small thing,’ she said. ‘Why do you have to make it difficult? Why must there be a reaction every fucking time?’ I didn’t respond. She waited. ‘I’m only asking you for some help.’

‘Look,’ I said. ‘I’m sorry.’

‘Why are you apologizing? What for? Apologizing isn’t the same as agreeing to do better.’ I saw her glance at the clock on the wall, and then she kissed my cheek briefly.

I was glad when she left that morning.

 

 

That same day, I returned to the mall. Raymond was standing in front of the booth, hands on hips. He was heavily stubbled. When he saw me, he stuck out his thumb. ‘Perfect timing, again.’

‘Thanks,’ I said, and then nervously added, ‘can I buy another Buddha? Is that allowed?’ I felt my ears getting hot.

At first, he said nothing and stared at me like he was confused.

Then he tore the duct tape that held the booth together and began dismantling it.

‘This isn’t my real office. I’m only here to help out a friend.’

‘Your friend is very lucky,’ I said.

There was a long pause. Not knowing what else to say, I quickly bent over and stacked the cardboard into a pile. I could feel his eyes on me. When I finally looked up, he was nodding to himself.

‘The guy who owns this mall is my friend,’ he said and picked up the cardboard. ‘He’s a billionaire. I’m just a decorative piece. You get to use people like that when you’re that rich.’

It came as a surprise. The fact that he had made himself vulnerable, I suddenly felt I could tell him anything. I looked around. The mall was getting crowded. Lines were starting to form outside the cafés and restaurants. ‘I know what you mean,’ I said, placing a hand over my heart for emphasis.

He came closer and put his arm around me.

‘Affinity,’ he said. ‘We have that.’ He gave me a new Buddha, free of charge, and then invited me to come to his home the following Monday.

 

 

Monday, I arrived in a loose t-shirt and jeans, thinking I would spend hours kneeling in front of tall statues inside a dark apartment, choking on incense smoke, but it wasn’t like that at all.

His place was a three-story semi-detached. There was a tree on the roof. Entering the metallic gate, I could hear chatter from inside the house.

There were several people waiting by the front door. Raymond’s housekeeper welcomed us. We were shown how to deposit our shoes in the electronic locker. I was carrying a pineapple as a gift for good luck, but my heart fell when I saw others had thought to do the same.

Inside the main hall, the ceiling was high, the walls lined with mirrors. The floor was a cool beige marble. Guests mingled, talked, and sipped drinks. I thought Raymond must be very respected, the fact that so many people turned up for his party on a Monday night. It was like a wedding I had once attended where nearly a thousand guests had shown up; everyone was confident the marriage would be a happy one.

At the back of the room there was a projector screen; Raymond stood there, facing a small crowd. He was dressed in a very clean navy suit, a white scarf tied around his neck. When he spotted me, he raised his chin to say hey. This made people turn their heads at me.

Quickly, I said to the man beside me, ‘He mistook me for someone. It’s my first time here.’

The man glanced at my pineapple and gave a warm smile. ‘First, a speech. Then we get to eat.’

The lights dimmed, and Raymond whispered testing into the microphone. He began speaking of ‘fate as a current’ and the screen behind him flashed a picture of the sea. He then drew connections between the why and the how, and why we should not resist it. Every now and then, he looked down, as if he’d just shared something very intimate with us. ‘Do you know what happens when you drown?’ he said. ‘You sink and fish eat you.’ I found his voice alluring.

After his speech, Raymond came and relieved me of my pineapple, handing it to his housekeeper. He was buzzing. When he hugged me, sweat from his hair touched my cheek.

‘Did you bring it?’ he whispered.

‘Yes,’ I said. ‘Hold on.’

I surrendered my birth certificate, which he took with both hands and locked inside a safe deposit box. He was honest with me. He said this was about our birth timings: some numbers are good, others are bad. Putting them all in one place neutralizes the aura – like a blender – so that everyone here can be on equal footing.

‘It takes a while to intuit what you can and cannot control.’

At the time, I didn’t really understand what he was getting at. I was just happy to have someone to talk to inside a crowded room.

‘Look around, you are now part of a large family,’ he said, gesturing. He wanted me to circle the room, weave between his guests to get a feel for the crowd, the excitement. But I was to keep my hands in my pockets, my lips sealed. I was not to return anyone’s greeting and to watch what that felt like.

 

 

People continued to arrive. Eventually there must have been eighty or ninety people in the room. Voices were coming from all directions. I was greeted with smiles, nods, and after a while I began to relax. I checked the time; this time last night – I remembered very clearly – I had been snacking alone in front of the television, unhappy that my wife wasn’t home.

Who knew where she was right now?

The buffet line was ready. Five folding tables, lined up, with ornamental flowers and trays of food. Two stewards in white uniforms were handing out paper plates and plastic forks and spoons.

Someone said to me, ‘The chicken curry is the freshest.’ I smiled, as if I agreed, and joined the queue.

I sent my wife a text: On your way home?

As I was putting away my phone, I suddenly recognized someone: an Olympian. I was startled. I had once seen her swim on television. Now, she was wearing a tight dress and talking with guests. The fact that she looked twice as good with dry hair surprised me. When she laughed, I could see her teeth were very healthy. Our eyes met and we both smiled; it felt like I’d won something. My heart was racing. I started scanning the room for more famous faces.

When the party was over, and taxis were pulling into the driveway, I was surprised to see many people still holding onto their pineapples. Most of them hovered by the hallway, and a few looked over at me as if I should tell them what to do. I approached one of them, a woman with dark circles under her eyes. The sense of serendipity had made me bold. I wanted to say something kind, but I became embarrassed at the last moment and said, ‘Waiting for a taxi?’

She shrugged and then left the house.

As I had hoped, Raymond came to me as I was putting on my shoes. ‘Fantastic work,’ he said. ‘I want you back next week.’

‘Oh, next week?’

‘I thought you’d be happier,’ he said.

‘One week is a long time to wait,’ I said.

That made him laugh. ‘You’re a really nice guy. You deserve good things.’ Then he extended his hand to haul me onto my feet.

From his eyes, I could tell he wasn’t joking at all.

 

 

Over the next few weeks, I found myself arriving early to have drinks with Raymond so he could introduce me to his celebrity guests before the party started. All was well. The famous, I realized, excelled at small talk and often they spoke with an energetic friendliness that was unique to high achievers. Being close to them, I felt as though I was back in school and these classmates had no qualms about teaching me a thing or two because they did not view me as competition. Eventually I got to be on first name basis with some of them. This was different. My younger self would have been proud.

The parties always had a good mix of men and women, although more often than not there were more good-looking women than men. Some of these men wore ladies’ suit pants that sat high up their waists, and would go about the room and strike up conversations with random women. These men appeared at ease and said things that made the women laugh. Watching them, I felt jealous.

One night, a man from this group came up to me and offered me a drink. He was a smallish guy with a friendly smile.

‘Hi,’ he said. ‘Raymond said you might have a question for me.’ I was taken aback.

‘What do you want to know?’ I looked at his pants. ‘Oh, it doesn’t look great,’ he admitted, ‘but it’s not awful either. You do get stares once in a while, and it can be very exciting. It empowers me.’

I thought about this for a while, finishing my drink.

That night, I took a taxi home. I found my wife already in bed, hiding under the duvet. ‘What’s going on?’ I asked her. ‘Don’t you have meetings and whatnot?’

‘Are there clinics in the neighborhood still open?’

‘I’ll check,’ I said and backed out of the room. I turned on the lights in the living room but after a while turned them off and walked up to the laundry basket in the kitchen. The apartment was very warm. I felt dazed, and a part of me was hoping my wife would suddenly emerge from the bedroom. When she did not, I lifted her pajama pants and began stretching the waistband. I thought I had gone mad. I put on the pants. The fabric was so soft. Once it brushed against my thighs I realized my hips were easing, my shoulders loosened. I tried walking and started laughing. I found myself opening the front door.

I ended up at the park. Breathing in the fresh air, I felt unusually light-hearted. I looked at my surroundings, the park bench, the street lamps, the stray cat, and the soft moon hanging in the sky.

I entered a 7-Eleven and bought a beer.

I said to the cashier, ‘How are you tonight? Everything going well?’ And she smiled back. ‘A little tired but thank you for asking.’

On my way home, I took deep gulps of the beer. I couldn’t stop thinking about that smile.

 

 

When I asked Raymond why he organized these parties, he joked that he was an attention-seeker. But then he turned serious and said, ‘If you spot a problem, you must let me know. I’ve been doing this for so long I can’t tell what’s lacking anymore.’ One night, he told me that he suspects his caterer had been overcharging him. We were in the hall, looking through the window, waiting for the first guests to arrive. ‘I’ll find you a better one,’ I offered, wanting to please.

The following week, I started a book to record how much each guest ate and drank, and I alerted him to a television host who always came for a quick drink and then left.

‘Should we do something?’ I asked.

‘If it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be,’ he answered almost immediately. When I didn’t say anything, he pointed to an actor walking around with ankle-wrist weights. ‘That was my idea – keep fit while socializing. This guy used to talk shit about me. But then my billionaire friend cast him in a film, and now he sticks to me like a fly. It’s a mistake to force people to like you.’

My face was stiff. ‘Does that mean I have no control?’

‘No, not always,’ he said, smiling. ‘You can try mimicking people. Most people find it hard to say no to themselves.’

So I began picking up the mannerisms of people at the parties after that. I approached the rich and famous in the room and offered them drinks. I asked about their day, whether the food was to their liking, acting as if I were their host. Then I observed how they responded and took mental notes.

Now I saw the crowded room as brimming with opportunities.

To appear confident in conversation, I learned to pinch my thumb and forefinger and move them like a woodpecker. A simple phrase, ‘I mean it,’ was suddenly charged with profundity.

And with time, I also grew less hesitant to speak my mind. I came clean the minute I got confused. I said, ‘Excuse me, but could you elaborate?’ When someone did well, I said, ‘That’s incredible,’ or ‘I’m happy for you.’ I said these things with verve. Another thing I learned was saying no. Now, whenever I looked into people’s eyes, I found myself saying, ‘I have explained myself and feel no need to do so any further,’ or ‘Let us just agree to disagree.’ Hearing these words, I would become deeply moved by myself.

The first time I uttered, ‘Let’s agree to disagree’ in an argument with my wife, she was shocked and became quiet.

She thought for a bit, and then lifted my hand. ‘Have you noticed? Your hands are smaller than most men’s.’

‘Sure.’ I felt nothing like my old self.

Then she pressed my hand against her breast. ‘See what I mean?’

I was silent. I felt calm and a bit absent. I shrugged. ‘I’m taking a shower,’ I told her and walked away. To my surprise, she followed me into the bathroom and started peeling off her clothes.

After that day, she began to initiate sex frequently, three to four times a week. And for a while, I felt pretty good about myself. When we kissed, she would leave hickies on my neck and laugh when she turned my head side to side to study them. Sometimes she would ask what I wanted and performed those things for me, and I would ask her the same, but she would shake her head and say, ‘No. No need,’ her voice coming from a faraway place. The hardest part was pretending that I didn’t mind and going to bed afterwards, even though I was irritated. Because the marriage continued to lack tenderness, I realized I couldn’t enjoy the additional sex my wife was giving. I found myself drinking more and more heavily at Raymond’s parties and, once home, using my drunkenness to avoid any sort of intimacy.

 

 

The night I met the billionaire, I wasn’t supposed to know he was dropping by, but Raymond had hired a team to trim the hedges in the front yard and even had the caterer replace a steward who had pimples on his face, so I knew pretty much instantly.

Raymond’s housekeeper and I were looking for stains on the living room carpet. Raymond inspected the food trays, his face pinkish with make-up.

‘Come and taste this,’ he called to me.

I hurried over. He smelled of cologne. ‘You look good,’ I said. Silver glitter flickered in his gelled hair. I thought how nice it must feel to know that someone was going out of their way to impress you.

‘Thanks,’ he said. ‘Is the curry spicy enough?’

‘Very.’

‘Good. He likes spicy. How are things with your wife?’

I looked at him. ‘Not great,’ I said, ‘I’m nervous all the time.’

‘Just keep doing what you’re doing. If things change, then it’s meant to be.’

‘I try to be nice but always I end up getting hurt.’

He turned to look at the driveway. Seeing it was empty, he said, ‘The issue is not your approach. Rather, some people simply do not find value in what we are offering them. It doesn’t always mean they’re happier, and so we must sympathize.’

I thought about this. ‘The thing is,’ I said, angrily, ‘I’m not asking for heaven and earth. What I’m just asking for is perfectly reasonable. Prioritize me over late-night meetings every now and then. Say, “Thank you for making breakfast.” Don’t say things like, “You’re the sort of guy who tries to dip a tea bag in a mug and misses completely.” Are these things too much to ask for?’

‘Calm down,’ he said, leaning forward. ‘I know what it is you want to hear. You want me to tell you that you’re right. But I can’t say that. What I can say is that you’re not wrong. For everything that happens, there are at least a dozen ways to understand it. Perhaps what you need is to step out of yourself. It takes time, but you will get there. I promise, all right? Now help me move the sunflowers to the center of the table. They look better there.’

The billionaire arrived with his wife and two bodyguards. He was tall, middle-aged, and wore brown shorts and a white t-shirt. His wife wasn’t as young and attractive as I thought she would be. She had a bouquet of lilies under her arm, and the crumpled flowers made her look strangely weary.

When Raymond saw them, he shouted, ‘My friend!’ and then hurried over to embrace the billionaire. It was around seven in the evening; the sun had just set.

Everyone turned to look at them.

Then the two disengaged and stepped back from each other. The billionaire patted Raymond on the cheek. ‘Say something interesting!’

It silenced the room.

I looked to the housekeeper from across the room. When she caught my eye, she turned and disappeared into the kitchen. Raymond was frozen but smiling.

The billionaire repeated himself.

Watching this, I felt sorry for Raymond and suddenly protective of him. I could release the drink in my hand – the crash, the liquid splattering on the floor would draw away everyone’s attention. All I had to do was uncurl my fingers, but somehow I couldn’t do it.

Then I saw Raymond turn to face the room and spread out his arms. ‘How do you control fate?’ he began, raising his voice. ‘I say go for a run before getting a haircut. If your hairdresser can’t stand the sweat and smell, she’ll give you a free wash.’ As he spoke, I became more and more upset with myself.

The billionaire was scanning the room. Nobody uttered another word until he burst out laughing.

Both men were soon surrounded by guests who went up to introduce themselves. I volunteered to take photos. I tried to be useful. Then Raymond pulled me aside and said he would be in his study and asked me to welcome the newcomers. ‘See that everyone has the food and drinks they need.’ I gave a thumbs up, and then he and the billionaire went upstairs.

I shook hands with people and took their pineapples. A few had brought pomelos and argued that pomelos were auspicious too. ‘Sure,’ I said, and turned them toward the door. The room was extremely noisy now and, from time to time, I thought about my wife. I wondered where she was, what she was doing and how she was feeling.

I spotted the billionaire’s wife alone by the buffet table. I approached her, obliquely, so as not to startle her. But before I could say anything, she snatched a handful of grapes and began mashing them into her face. She started crying.

‘Hey,’ I said.

She turned to me. ‘Oh shit, sorry.’

I quickly reached out with napkins. Because I knew my flowers, I said, ‘Lilies. Someone apologized to you?’

She looked down at the flowers. She tried to say something but found her throat blocked.

‘Breathe,’ I said.

‘Is sex so important to men?’ she asked me. ‘What about love? What about love?’ She was sniffling.

I showed her my wedding ring. I said, ‘Of course, love is important.’

She smiled and nodded, and I felt grateful for some reason. ‘Why else would two people be together?’

I wanted to talk about my wife and my feelings toward her then, but I had learnt that you should never talk about yourself when someone confides in you. So I ushered her to the sofa and sat her down beside me. ‘What’s causing your unhappiness?’ I asked.

She wavered for a long time before pulling out her phone. ‘Look at this,’ she said and played this grainy clip of a woman sucking off a man inside a hotel room. ‘This is the man I married.’

‘Ah.’ I thought for a second. ‘Have you spoken to him?’

She nodded. ‘It was ugly,’ she said. ‘He smashed wine bottles against the wall. And then threatened to cut his wrists.’ She paused and hid her face.

‘You must be heartbroken.’

I gestured for Raymond’s housekeeper to bring us drinks. While we waited, I wondered what Raymond would say at a time like this. When the drinks came, I took a gulp and tipped my glass at her, feeling the early stages of drunkenness.

‘What if you had to choose between two pairs of pants?’ I asked. ‘The first has been soaked in wet dog shit, and the other once belonged to a murderer who tortured children – which pair would you pick?’

She looked at me.

‘Both are the same size, color, and cutting,’ I added. ‘But one has been soaked in shit.’ She laughed nervously.

‘Let me remind you. Both have been washed. One is just as clean as the other.’ Then I reached for her hands. ‘Do you see? Your choice is based on an aura – this feeling that something is dirtier than the other. Do you see what I mean? To forgive your husband, think of him like a laundered pair of pants.’

I took a deep breath and looked around the room and it was suddenly obvious how loud I had been. I felt lightheaded.

‘You love him, am I right?’ I asked. ‘You want to forgive him?’ She couldn’t tell exactly.

‘I think so,’ she said. ‘It’s not like one day I love him and the next I don’t – I can tell myself that.’

‘Fair enough.’

She stared at my face for a moment, narrowing her eyes, and then snorted. ‘How much do you think murderers’ pants cost?’

‘I’m sure you can afford it.’

When she laughed, I felt triumphant. I said to her, ‘Thank you for sharing.’

And then I heard clapping behind me.

It was Raymond. He looked very pleased. ‘You have potential,’ he said. ‘You have wisdom to share.’ I told him I was just trying to help and he thanked me. I looked around the room. The billionaire was eating by one of the cocktail tables and talking with two beautiful women. He had a napkin tucked in his collar and held a fork in his hand.

Later, when we were alone, Raymond whispered in my ear, ‘Go upstairs. Go into my study. Someone will greet you there.’ I had never seen the inside of his study.

I went up and opened the door. There was a strong smell of cigar smoke and perfume. A woman in a tube dress was stubbing out a cigarette on an ashtray. ‘Another one?’ She glanced over at me, and the hair on the back of my neck stood up.

I took a deep breath. ‘Yes.’

That night, I left the house without shame or guilt. I kept thinking of the things my wife did that irritated me. Cheating on her was to avoid getting hurt. I felt optimistic, stronger. Walking toward the bus stop, I wished I could walk forever. Then I hopped onto a bench and started playing the air guitar. I imagined undergarments, roses, and love letters hurled at me. I imagined carrying these items home in large plastic bags and showing them to my wife; she becomes jealous, then afraid. All was not lost. I felt certain I could be kind to her now. I looked up at the sky. It was black and starry.

 

 

Little by little, everything was arranged. Raymond converted one of his studies into an office where I could offer consultations to his guests. He bought me suits and shoes, and even paid for a dentist to whiten my teeth.

I asked him, ‘Why would people want to hear what I have to say?’

‘You don’t make them,’ he answered. ‘You speak, and if they like what they hear, they’ll stay around. If they don’t, they don’t. That has always been the job.’

My official title wasn’t fortune teller but Life Coach. I took my station five nights a week and shook hands with people who came in, asking them, ‘Do you want to feel like everything is within your reach?’

Usually, they stayed silent and waited for me to go on. Once alcohol was served, I had them sit down. I would then ask various questions and nod solemnly at their stories. The shy ones tended to look at their hands or the ceiling while they spoke, but everyone wanted a listening ear and someone to say aloud what they already knew in their hearts. Deep down, we all recognize that things will never change, and we are more or less ready to accept it.

As Life Coach, what I offered was encouragement.

I posed questions like, ‘What’s the worst that could happen?’ And if they answered, I said, ‘That’s unlikely. You know that.’

Most of these sessions lasted between five to ten minutes, though they got longer as I gained more confidence. Once the time was up, I would fish out a crystal bracelet from the desk drawer and say, ‘This will protect you from harm. Wear it, even in the shower, and you’ll notice good things coming your way.’ These bracelets weren’t free, of course. They cost as much as a Rolex watch. Raymond’s housekeeper would collect the money at the door.

I really enjoyed what I did. Whenever I arrived at the house and saw the party, people turning their heads, I imagined half of them had come specifically to see me. Nearly always I would find gifts on my desk: tickets to sold-out concerts, vouchers for skin-care products endorsed by my actor friends, and sometimes, Mao Shan Wang durians from a humble fruit-seller buddy. Moments like these, I felt loved.

I was enjoying myself so much that I could ignore, to some extent, the tension I felt at home. I began making up stories about where I had been but at the same time I felt indignant that I had to lie. I thought if I had a good time at a party or helped someone, I should be able to come home smiling and tell someone. Often I would return very late, two or three in the morning. I would be hot and tipsy and would walk unsteadily. I would wash my face with cold water to sober up. Once, my wife got mad because I’d woken her up. ‘Are you an elephant?’ she shouted and threw a pillow at me. ‘Why do you have to walk so loud?’ She was having a lovely dream and now it was gone. I was staring at my spot on the bed, paralyzed.

I left the room and slept on the sofa.

I couldn’t find my Laughing Buddha the following day. I called my wife, and she came out of the room and shoved a five-dollar in my hand. She had just showered and was all dressed up, but her hair was wet. She said the Buddha cluttered the flat and so she sold it at Cash Converters.

I demanded an apology.

‘Go pray for one,’ she said, and then left the apartment.

From then on, it became a competition of who would come home later than the other. My wife would slam the door or the toilet seat, jolting me awake, whereas I would max out the volume on the television or gargle Listerine. Some nights, though, she would open the door and just stand there, watching me. And I would see her lips move but not hear anything.

Weeks went by. There was so much anger inside me I felt tired all the time. Unable to rid this feeling, I was left confused. I didn’t understand why I was still miserable despite having transformed myself. And I became so frustrated that I thought I was going to cry. Not knowing what else to do, I bought flowers and wrote apology cards, but I was aware that I was doing these things to stop the fighting and it was out of self-preservation.

 

 

One night, I got very drunk. When I came home, I heard muffled voices from behind the bedroom door. At first I thought it was my imagination. So I lowered myself onto the sofa and tried to focus, and I began to feel sick in the heart. My head started to spin. I vomited. And when I took a breath, I couldn’t fill my chest with enough air. Exhausted, I blacked out.

When I woke up the next day, the bedroom door was closed. I thought I was still dreaming. Then, realizing that whoever was with my wife last night must have snuck out and seen me fast asleep, I became wide awake. I didn’t know what to do. I thought about how my wife and I used to go window-shopping before we got married. One time we saw a man leaving the casino, grinning, and my wife, on a whim, suggested we follow him around the mall. We were embarrassed for him when he stood in line for boba tea. My wife called him a loser and we laughed, then returned to the casino and tailed one guy after another until someone bought a Louis Vuitton bag. Lying there, I felt so empty and in such a desperate need of comfort that I nearly got up to check inside the bedroom. But I was afraid of another fight. I wondered if this was any way for a person to live.

It took effort, but I eventually sat up and wiped the tears from my face. I took out my phone and opened YouTube. I watched award speeches and started smiling when actors included anecdotes of trials and tribulations. Every now and then the camera panned over to an actor’s spouse, and I would spot their happy tears. It was the most beautiful thing. I felt happy for them. I don’t know how long I stayed there before my wife came out of the bedroom.

 

 

She told me it wasn’t working. Her voice was soft but firm. She patted the sofa cushion, indicating she wanted me to come closer. She waited for me move, but when I did not she said, ‘Why are you like this?’ I felt a lot of guilt, yet also anger – she had chosen not to bear any responsibility for what had become of us.

It was almost noon, and sunlight poured in through the window.

The room didn’t look real. ‘Did you sleep with another man?’ I asked.

When she couldn’t give an answer, I found myself yelling at her. I called her a bully, a tyrant, but none of this seemed to unnerve her or move her to say something nice to me.

‘Do you think you’ll change?’ I finally asked.

‘Look, this marriage is over,’ she said. ‘I love you, but it’s over.’

She had on a full face of makeup and was wearing that low-cut dress I hated. ‘Why are you wearing that again?’ I asked.

‘You know what? I’ll give you a few days to process this.’ Then she packed some clothes into a suitcase. At the door, she said, ‘Text me.’

I nodded slowly.

My shame was now so great that I felt like hurting myself. I got up and guzzled water from the kitchen tap. My mouth was all twisted. As I drank, I regretted everything mean I could have said to her but did not.

Later that day, I removed our mattress from our bedroom because it felt dirty. I slid a blanket underneath the mattress and began to yank the fabric until my body was cold. At the front door, I put on my slippers. I took the stairs.

I began dragging the mattress across the street.

It took almost an hour. Several times I had to squat down to catch my breath. All around me was quiet except for crows cawing in the trees, and I propped the bed against the side of the dumpster so it wouldn’t obstruct foot traffic. Looking at the mattress, I considered how tainted it was. I wiped away my sweat, and the reality of having been abandoned suddenly became real. I’ve done nothing wrong, I said to myself and began to heave. After that, I came home, took a shower, and ate something.

For a week or so, at 7.30 p.m. every evening, I called Raymond on the phone. This helped me pass the time. I would stand by the window and listen to him talk about the parties. He said there were people asking for me. I assured him I would be back because I felt the need to be polite.

He mentioned a gift from the billionaire: a silver Bentley. It was sitting in the driveway. He had been having his meals by the window so that he could look at the car.

‘I can’t drive,’ he said and laughed.

I told him I was looking out the window too. That some idiot had left a mattress by the dumpster. The garbage truck hadn’t arrived, and it had been almost a week. Rain or shine, the bed sat there, slumped, for all the neighbors to see. Several cars drove by. Schoolchildren in blue uniforms were hurrying back from school. I was wearing shorts and a gray singlet.

‘It’s an eyesore,’ I said.

He was supposed to speak but did not.

    "url": "https://granta.com/depth-of-a-cave",
    "text": "Bruno had always known the caves were there, he wrote to Pascal and the Moulinards, but the depth of them, their spatial complexity, had stunned him.

We never expect the true depth of a cave, he said, on account of our indoctrination, our enslavement to the aboveground, which is scaled to us and above us, scaled to trees, to high-rise buildings, to the industrial dreams of twentieth-century man, and to his military imagination, scaled to fighter jets, and to heaven, to our need to claim something in the blue beyond, a thing we might call ‘blessed’.

This vertical arrow aiming from ground to sky constitutes modern man’s entire spatial reality, Bruno wrote. It excludes the other direction, he wrote, the down-into-the-earth. This is an incredible blind spot, he said, and he himself had not understood how blind, until he one day squeezed himself into his own cave, on his own little property in the Guyenne.

When he had purchased the land, in the early 1970s, the previous owner had shown him the cave as a curiosity. That owner had kept a board over its entrance. Beyond the board was an opening, a cavern five feet shallow, at the end of which two rocks angled together into a narrow crevice. For years, the board remained there. One day, in the period after he’d left the farmhouse, and the barn, and was sleeping in his little stone hut, Bruno removed the board and went in. He put his hand through the crevice in the rocks and felt wind. He understood that beyond the crevice there must be a large open space. He returned with ropes and a headlamp and pushed through the crevice and lowered himself. He did not hit bottom for quite a while. When he did, he was in an enormous room, its ceiling perhaps three meters high. He found multiple openings off this main room leading in different directions.

One particularly magnificent discovery was a chamber that was flocked white like a snowy landscape. Is this a dream? he wondered. It was not a dream. The walls were coated with magnesium crystals. They were blanketed in sparkling white, a natural geologic phenomenon. Some call this moon milk, Bruno wrote. It coated the floor. In that moon-milk floor were indentations that he believed were records of human presence, and in particular, shapes that looked, and felt, like the footprints of a child. There were regions of the underground network where water ran through, he said. The water was very cold. In some places it was neck-high, he said, and in the water lived strange crustaceans with translucent shells that seemed to thrive in absolute darkness.

This entire valley, he said, was laced with underground springs and rivers and lakes. Because Bruno’s adult son studied hydrology and currently worked in that field, he had helped Bruno to better understand the caverns and the water table and especially how to remain safe, because in winter, he said, caves could fill and quickly.

One day my son took me to a lavoir fed by a spring, Bruno said. The water is clear, my son pointed out. When the water is cloudy, he said, you know that someone has been in the cave whose spring fills this washbasin. The underground waterway, my son explained, has thick silt in its bed. When it is disturbed by footsteps, silt is kicked up.

 

The cave in which Bruno slept was dry year-round, if a good deal cooler in temperature than a modern Frenchman might prefer.

He planned to stay in the home he had made for himself underground. Although he did exit the caves regularly, as he indicated in the emails. He got fresh air. He tended to his permaculture, having renounced modern farming techniques. He took walks on shaded forest paths. And he wrote to Pascal Balmy and the Moulinards at a computer terminal that belonged to his adult daughter, in the kitchen of the old stone farmhouse. Bruno’s son had pointed out to him that the French government had more than clouded the waters of the communal washbasins. They had desecrated the entire subterranean world of southern France with tunnels for their high-speed trains.

I can hear the Paris–Toulouse from down there, Bruno said. I sense its vibrations. I feel the faintest touch of its wind.

Bruno’s son was of the opinion that the state’s mad plan to leach out all the groundwater and shunt it into industrial bays would wreck the ecological balance of the Guyenne.

When the digging work began for the Tayssac megabasin, Bruno said he was convinced he heard the sound of the excavators. He felt a level of disturbance that seemed to come from multiple directions, and from which there might be no escape. One day, the sound stopped, he said. The subterranean world was quiet, left in peace. But peace was temporary. These days, he said, I hear again the distant groan of machines clawing downward.

And just when I thought we were at last arriving at the main subject – sabotage of trains and of earth-moving equipment – Bruno went off the rails.

 

He’d been in these caves twelve years now, he said, and still he had not gotten to any definable ‘end’, the caverns’ design instead calling into question the whole concept of an end.

I hear people, he said, whose voices are eternal in this underground world, which is all planes of time on a single plane.

Here on earth is another earth, he said. A different reality, no less real. It has different rules.

You won’t understand any of this from me telling you about it, Bruno said. You might even dismiss what I say. The little I myself understand has taken patience, he said, and rigorous deprogramming.

For nine-tenths of human time on earth people went underground. Their symbolic world was formed in part by their activities in caves, by modalities and visions that darkness promised. Then, this all ceased. The underground world was lost to us. The industrial uses of the earth, the digging, fracking, tunneling, are mere plunder and do not count, Bruno said. Modern people who build bomb shelters, planning to survive some version of apocalypse, also do not count, he said. Yes, they go underground, but not in mind of a human continuum, a community. They think, I’ll be the clever one, the one who survives mass death. But why would you want to survive mass death? What would be the purpose of life, if life were reduced to a handful of armed pessimists hoarding canned foods and fearing each other? In a bunker, you cannot hear the human community in the earth, the deep cistern of voices, the lake of our creation.

In my cave, he said, under my cave, welling up from deeper passages, I hear so many things. Not just the drip of water.

I hear voices. People talking. Sometimes it’s in French, sometimes Occitan, or older tongues of the Languedoc, many languages I do not recognize, sounds of which I cannot understand a word, but I know that what I hear is humans, it is human talk.

Did we always have language? We don’t know the answer to this.

Linguists try to chart what they call ‘glotto-chronologies’. They picture language like a tree, with a trunk. The first language, at the base of the trunk, being simple and common, what some call ‘nostratic’. This is a fantasy. But who can refute them? They cannot escape the chains of their telos, the sad idea that they are the logical outcome, the advanced form of human speech, and that what came before must have been simple and crude.

They never imagine that if language is a tree, they must look not at its trunk, but at its roots, which, like a tree’s roots, might form an upside-down chandelier of extravagant complexity, reaching and spreading deep into the dark beyond. But most people are unable to grasp how far down the physical world goes. And they would not know that voices are stored in its depths, unless they were to hear those voices.

It is hard to explain, he said. You would have to have lived as I live, done what I have done, learned what I have learned, in order to hear what I hear. You would need a different consciousness, he said.

When you live underground, among the things you discover is that you are not alone. You’re in a world richly peopled. Occupied by legions.

Homo erectus, who stood up and cooked, Bruno said, he is here.

Homo neanderthalensis, who huddled modestly and dreamed expansively: here.

Homo sapiens, gone into caves to paint, to render his capture with extra legs, extra horns, so that these beasts canted and ran over cave walls, or butted heads, clashed and fought, all in the light of a torch, H. sapiens’s underground cinema house: that resourceful and ruinous forebear of ours, he is here.

Cathars and other heretics, the few not slaughtered, gone deep, living in darkness: yes, present.

Cagots, after the war of 1594, hiding to survive. Surviving in secret.

Here.

Cavers, nineteenth-century men and boys, killed by curiosity, fallen in, unable to make their way out: here.

The partisans, men of my own boyhood, who retreated underground to hide from rampaging Germans: they, too, are here.

For a long time, he said, you cannot tune in. Then, you might sense a current or buzz of telluric energy. This sound transforms, the more time you spend in caves. It becomes voices. You hear these voices but are unable to isolate them. It takes years to learn how to listen, to differentiate, to adjust your inner tuner to a position on the atemporal bandwidth of the underground world.

Remember shortwave transmission? he asked them. Probably you don’t, he answered. Tuning into shortwave programming used to be an art, Bruno said. Depending on the bandwidth, it worked best at night, on account of how radio waves travel back from the ionosphere. There was a book, he said, that listed programs by calendar schedule and megahertz. Some of the programs came in stronger than others. You learned to listen for where to put the shortwave dial, between two points of static, and how to position your antenna, in order to hear a Bulgarian choir or news from Senegal or Venezuela’s Radio Juventud.

Shortwave is real, of course, he said. It is also a metaphor. I bring it up not to reminisce over dead technologies, but to help you understand. Cave frequencies, he said, are not three to thirty megahertz. Cave bandwidth crosses moments, eras, epochs, eons. You have to learn to get inside the monophony, to tease it apart. Eventually, you encounter an extraordinary polyphony. You begin to sort, to filter. You hear whispers, laughter, murmurs, pleas. There’s a feeling that everyone is here. A wonderful feeling, I should add. Because suddenly you realize how alone we have been, how isolated, to be trapped, stuck in calendar time, and cut off from everyone who came before us.

I never want to be that alone again, he said."

Down below, deep in the belly of the ship, we could hear its every moan: wood straining under the weight of bodies, rusted chains grinding against the walls. Even our captors’ feet shuffling back and forth, back and forth, above us. We knew death had come.

We couldn’t help but search the surrounding darkness for it, as if death might leap from the damp planks. Where we were taken from, death had many faces; it was a panther stalking in the shadows, a fever that rose with the rains. But down here all we saw were the dim outlines of our bodies, packed tight, shoulder to shoulder, back-to-back.

The bite of chains kept us awake, our wrists and ankles rubbed raw from weeks of the same. When exhaustion gave way to sleep, it was fitful, haunted by wicked dreams of home – dreams that twisted the familiar into something cruel. We tried to stay still to save each other from the pain, but then infection set in. With skin cracked and swollen, there was little to do but scratch and scrape, scratch and scrape, and when that brought no relief, we tore at whatever flesh we could to dull the burn, to feel anything but the rot creeping through our bones.

Drops of saltwater dripped from above and stung our wounds, stiffened our hair, matted it to our scalps.

We tried not to lose ourselves in misery. Our moaning had subsided long ago. In the early days, a woman screamed with terror and her cries summoned one of the white men down with his weapon. He took her up the stairs that led to the sky and we never saw her again. We heard her though, her wails echoing in the night. The memory of her screams silenced us all, like the cry of a hyena warning of death lurking near.

Many of us stopped praying. But there were some who held hope – hope that the big white water, in its mercy, might swallow the ship whole before it delivered us to whatever world waited.

Nothing could save us from the stink of pus and piss, spilling across the floor, the air thick with it and clinging to our skin, our breath, until it became part of us – until we could no longer tell where the stench ended and we began. In this way, we became one – a part of each other, through misery, shit and blood.

To pass the time, and perhaps more to forget it altogether, we clung to whatever fragments of our lives we could bear remembering. Down here, a thought was a precious thing. It carried our entire lives. One man pictured a wife asleep in their hut, an infant nestled at her chest – their faces soft and serene. Perhaps they shared the same dream, a dream he tried to reach right into. When his hand brushed against nothing, in that moment, he lost everything he had once possessed all over again.

The image stripped him bare and left him weeping into the dark, speaking in a tongue most of us could not understand. The sound of his grief was sharp and startling, filling what little space we had between us. For weeks, we had grown used to a low, miserable groaning, occasionally an outcry. Now, we had to adjust to this new desolate sorrow.

‘What do you remember?’ someone called out to the weeping man.

He choked back his sobs, his voice low but rigid as if daring the silence to swallow it. ‘Everything,’ he said. ‘My whole world. The land that carried me, the sun that warmed my back, the voices of my kin.’

For many of us, his words were a tangle of sounds, but soon another called out from the shadows, recognizing the familiar cadence.

‘Where do you come from?’

‘Anomabo. And you, friend?’

‘Assin Manso, near the great forest.’

There was a sudden, desperate joy in the way their voices met, like souls grasping for each other in the dark. As if stirred by this union, the ship began to shift beneath us. The shuffling above grew frantic, the murmur of the white men turning to shouts, sharp and urgent. Fear descended heavily, like a fog.

‘Tell us what makes you weep so? Tell us your memory,’ someone else called out.

The man hesitated, drawing a shaky breath. ‘I remember her,’ he said, his voice cracking under the weight of the words. His silence stretched, heavy and expectant, pressing down on all of us. When he spoke again, it was barely above a whisper. ‘I remember the woman I could never forget, even when the world tries to tear her from my mind.’

We all held our breath, listening. His words wrapped around us, pulling us closer, binding us to his grief. Slowly, we adjusted to their presence, letting ourselves sink into them as if they could carry us somewhere far from this dark, damp hold.

That was how the tellings began, each story birthing another. They warmed us, strengthened our aching limbs, eased our sores and flowed through our veins like healing currents. They cracked open the ship’s planks, letting in glimpses of the sky and the world we’d left behind.

So, we told them, and with each telling, the person seemed to gleam, like a star in the ship’s darkness.

We wanted to tell them to you, to share the light that still flickered, even here on the blackest of night.

 

the edge of the field

 

She was waiting for me every morning at the edge of the field, with a basket on her hip and a smile that could stop time. She was the daughter of old Nuru, the village healer, and she had her mother’s wisdom in her eyes.

I knew she had dreams – dreams that reached further than the fields we tended, beyond the life our people built together. Most would have been content with a husband, children, a home to care for, but not her. She wanted more. She wanted to heal the land, to find a way to bring the rains back, to make the earth fertile again. The dryness that crept into our village, cracking the soil and withering our crops, troubled her deeply.

She’d talk about it in the quiet moments when the day’s work was done, and the sky was an endless blue above us. She’d speak of roots that ran deep beneath the surface, of the power hidden in the earth, waiting to be unlocked. She believed there was a cure, something beyond the herbs her mother taught her to use, beyond the prayers whispered to the gods. She saw things others couldn’t – or maybe just wouldn’t.

But her ideas set her apart. The other women in the village didn’t understand why she cared so much about the land when there were babies to raise, meals to prepare, a husband to tend to. They thought her strange, always with her head tilted, listening for something no one else could hear. Some called her foolish; others, stubborn. But to me, she was a vision, a force that moved with quiet grace, and I loved her.

Her mother and father saw her dreams, her way of seeing the world, as something strange, something that would keep her apart from the rest. Old Nuru was respected, yes, but even she could not shield her daughter from the whispers, or the way people would look at her sideways, wondering what kind of woman cared more for plants and rain than for marriage and children.

I remember the day I asked. Her father, a quiet man with rough hands and a hard stare, sat across from me in their hut, sizing me up. I could see the doubt in his eyes, the way he hesitated before he spoke. ‘You know she is not like other girls,’ he said, as a warning. ‘She won’t change. If you marry her, you’ll have to live with all that comes with her – those strange ideas, the way she thinks.’

I did not hesitate. ‘I know,’ I told him. ‘That is why I want her.’

Her parents looked at each other, her mother’s brow furrowed, her lips pressed tight. I knew they loved her, but they didn’t know what to do with her, this daughter who was both a blessing and a mystery. In the end, they said yes, not because they believed I was the one who could make her happy, but because they feared she’d be alone otherwise. They thought I was the best chance she had.

And maybe I was. I didn’t care that others thought her strange, didn’t care if she didn’t fit the mould they had for a wife. To me, she was everything I never knew I needed. A wild, brilliant spark in a world that was sometimes too dark.

We built our life from the earth, the same way my father and his father did before me. I could see our sons growing tall, like the Kapok trees that shaded our village. She started planting things no one else bothered with – deep-rooted plants that didn’t wilt easily, herbs and flowers that seemed out of place among the rows of cassava and maize. She said they were medicine for the land. ‘The soil needs to breathe,’ she’d tell me, her eyes bright, full of conviction. ‘It needs to be healed, just like a body.’

I’d watch her, my heart swelling with a mix of pride and fear. I wanted to believe in her vision, but I also knew how the village talked. They saw her bending over those tiny green shoots, whispering to them, and they shook their heads.

‘What good are these plants?’ they’d say. ‘You can’t eat them.’

But she didn’t care. She tended her plants like they were children, watering them when everyone else said it was a waste, singing to them in the evenings, her voice low and soothing. And slowly, almost imperceptibly, the earth began to respond. There was a softness to it that hadn’t been there before, a hint of green where there had only been brown.

It wasn’t a miracle, and it was no work of god. But it was there – a promise, a beginning. Even though most people still didn’t understand, I knew she was onto something. I’d see her out there, standing in the field at dusk, the wind catching her braids, and I’d think she looked like she belonged to the land, like she was a part of it in a way none of us could ever be.

It happened quietly, like most things with her. One morning, she told me she was carrying our child. She said it with a calm certainty, her hand resting on her belly, and for a moment, I couldn’t breathe. A son, she said, and I believed her because she had that way of knowing things.

He was born under a moon that shone brighter than I’d ever seen, full and low, casting its silver light across the fields. She named him Amani, a name that meant peace.

I was remembering the last time I saw them together, sleeping. That morning, when I left, she woke and held onto me a moment longer. Her eyes searched mine as if she knew. I told her I’d be back by the next moon. I promised. And then I walked away, thinking I’d see her waiting there again, like always, at the edge of the field.

I wonder if she’s still there, waiting.

 

–

 

His words hung in the air. For a moment, all we could hear was each other’s breathing – a fragile, shared rhythm. The story had drawn out each of our griefs and gave it a shape in the dark, like smoke. But it didn’t last.

The ship groaned a deep sound that cut through the stillness. A tremor rippled through us, limbs shifting and chains scraping. The trance dissolved. We braced ourselves, for what was creeping closer. From a dark corner of the hold, another voice rose, trembling but resolute.

‘My people also struggled with the land,’ she said. ‘But unlike your woman, we didn’t try to heal it. We looked to the gods.’

Her voice was old and weathered, like wind whispering through ancient reeds.

 

the flood of prayers

 

We had prayed for the rains. For months, the land had cracked beneath our feet, the ground thirsty and splitting open like old clay. The river shrank to nothing more than a trickle, and the goats grew thin, their ribs pressing sharp against their hides. Every morning, we gathered at the center of the village, offering up our pleas to the sky, begging for mercy.

The elders led the prayers, their voices rising in unison, arms lifted to the heavens. We followed them, our own voices growing hoarse from the asking. We brought offerings of food, small though they were, and placed them in the center of the village, hoping the gods would see our need and answer us. Days passed. Then weeks. Still, the sky remained clear, unforgiving.

And then, the rains came.

At first, it was just light drops tapping against the ground, as though the gods were testing their gift. We rejoiced. Women danced with their arms stretched wide, faces lifted to feel the cool drops on their skin. Their ululations rose into the air, a joyful sound that echoed across the village, blending with the rhythm of the rain. The children ran barefoot through the village, laughing and splashing in the first muddy puddles. I stood there, watching the earth drink deeply. We thought it was salvation.

But by the next day, the sky had opened fully. The rain no longer fell softly but pounded the village relentlessly, as if all the water that had been withheld for months was now pouring down at once. The river swelled, rising faster than we could have imagined. Fields that had been barren were now drowning, the crops we had fought to save washed away.

At first, no one spoke of it. We thought the rains would pass and we tried to keep our spirits high, thanking the gods for answering our prayers. But in the quiet, when no one else was around, we whispered that maybe we had prayed too much.

I stood at the riverbank one evening, the rain still falling hard. The river, once a thin and struggling stream, had become a roaring, rushing beast. It tore at the banks, eating away at the land. I watched as one of our sacred trees lost its grip and fell into the water, swept away as if it had never stood there at all.

Was this the gods’ gift, we wondered, or their wrath?

We huddled together in our homes, listening to the rain batter the walls. No one said it aloud, but we all felt it – we had asked for mercy, and perhaps, in return, we had been given too much.

 

–

 

‘There’s water!’

It had been so soft during the old woman’s telling, like a memory unfolding, that we hadn’t noticed it at first. Not until it was up to our ankles.

‘It’s coming in,’ another voice shouted. ‘Look at the walls!’

Saltwater seeped through the cracks, snaking down the wood. We jolted – chains scraping, breaths quickening, fear spreading like ripples on water.

Somewhere in the shadows, a girl giggled softly. ‘Look at the froth! It’s like flowers,’ she said. Her voice was happy, confused, like the touch of a fever.

Another voice followed hers, cutting through the growing panic. ‘Yes, little one. They are like flowers.’

‘I knew flowers,’ the girl whispered, her voice floating above the murmurs, carrying an unsettling joy. ‘I picked them by the gate.’

‘Those flowers beyond the gate,’ the voice coaxed, ‘they hold memories, don’t they?’

‘Yes,’ the girl mused. ‘Maybe when the waters go, we’ll find new flowers waiting for us.’

The shouts above were drifting down – sharp bursts in the white man’s language – but we no longer heard them. The fear that had begun to rise among us softened, folding back into the darkness like the receding tide.

‘Tell us,’ the voice urged from the shadows. ‘Tell us about the flowers beyond the gate.’

And so, another story began, rising among us like a fragile bloom in the blackness, the words holding the sea back – for a little longer.

 

the flowers beyond the gate

 

I hadn’t planned on going far from the gate that day. The sun was stretching the shadows long and thin over the village. I could feel them watching me. They weren’t supposed to be that long yet. My basket pressed tight against my side, and I told myself to hurry – Kemi’s child would arrive soon, and I had to gather wild roots and leaves to ease her pain. They always trusted me for that.

I knew which roots to boil and which herbs to crush. The knowledge was planted deep, running through my blood, passed from my mother’s hands to mine, and hers before her. If I could just find the right roots, everything would be fine.

The guards stood at the gate, their spears glinting like teeth. Their eyes scanned the horizon. As long as I could see them, I was safe. I crouched low, fingers digging into the earth, pulling up the roots I needed. The Kankana roots, thick and gnarled, resisted at first. I pulled harder; Kemi would need them. The Kinkeliba leaves would make a bitter tea, one that could hold her through the hours of labour. These plants couldn’t grow inside the village – they choked the tame crops.

Then I saw it – Chinyika. Its bright petals – pink, red, and white – flaring like fire stars against the green. It wasn’t supposed to be here, not now, not with the air so dry. Things didn’t grow when the world was cracking open. And yet, there it was – waiting. I knew its roots could heal wounds, loosen the fever’s grip. But I also knew the guards smeared it on their spears. Just a scratch could turn blood against itself.

I glanced toward the guards again, telling myself it would only take a moment. The flowers weren’t far, just past the trees, only a little beyond where the earth breathes wild. If I was quick, no one would notice.

I stood and stepped off the path, slipping between the trees. The petals brushed my fingers, soft as silk. Their fragrance was sweet and strange, curling inside my chest like a song I couldn’t quite remember. I plucked a few, tucking them into my basket. But it wasn’t enough. I needed more.

The more I gathered, the more I wanted. The roots curled like sleeping snakes, delicate and dangerous, and I marvelled at their power – how something so beautiful could poison or save, depending on who held it.

It wasn’t until I looked up that I realized how far I’d gone. The guards were gone. The village, too. The air felt wrong – too still, too empty. My heart twisted inside my chest. I clutched the basket tight and ran, tripping over roots, rushing back toward the gate.

When I returned, the women gathered close, their hands reaching for the flowers and roots in my basket. I told them about the Chinyika – how it had bloomed bright and fierce. Too fierce for this season, but there it was just beyond the gate. Their eyes gleamed with understanding.

‘We should go tonight,’ one whispered urgently. ‘While the blooms are still fresh.’

But the guards stepped forward, blocking our way. ‘Not at night,’ they warned, their voices low. ‘It’s too dangerous. White devils stalk the land, snatching those who wander too far from the village.’

We laughed at them. ‘What’s this? Have our fearless warriors grown frightened of children’s tales?’ But their faces stayed grim, their hands tight on their spears. So we waited, promising ourselves that we’d go at dawn before the sun could steal the cool of the night.

When the first light touched the land, we rose early and hurried toward the grove. But when we reached the place where the flowers had burned so bright, they were gone. Not a petal, not a trace. Only the bare earth, empty and cracked, as if nothing had ever grown there.

As we turned back toward the gate, no one spoke. The only sound was the crunch of our feet on the dry earth, each step pressing the loss deeper into our bones. I told myself they were just flowers, but the thought didn’t feel true. Something else had been lost, something I couldn’t name.

 

–

 

For a moment, the girl’s strange laughing voice hung there, like a damp shroud. We had all heard it in her story – a hollow, distant quality, like the final hum of a broken instrument. It was the sound of something slipping away.

We had no way of knowing what she had lived through before now.

We realized, then, that the story she told wasn’t just a tale – it was perhaps her last memory. Or maybe it was the only memory she had left now that her mind had fractured. We understood, too, that she clung to it as if it were a lifeline – something solid in a world that had broken beneath her feet.

‘I knew flowers,’ the girl whispered again. ‘I picked them by the gate.’

Around us, the sea pressed harder against the wood, charging in from all sides like a great herd crashing through the planks. The saltwater swirled at our legs, cold and rising, but no one moved. No one complained. We sat still, waiting for the next voice to rise. Waiting for another story to tether us to our lost world a little longer.

And then, softly, it came: a voice from the dark, hesitant at first. ‘There was a boy,’ he began.

The ship groaned a low hollow sound that seemed to say I’m listening.

 

 the hunter’s hands

 

The voice was faint at first, barely cutting through the rush of water and creaking wood. Then it grew stronger.

‘There was a boy,’ it began again, ‘just six years old. Small and scrawny, but he had a fire in him, a fierceness he couldn’t yet hold in his little bones. He wanted to be a warrior, like his brothers. Wanted to run through the tall grass with a spear in his hand, to be strong and fearless. But they laughed, called him a reed that would snap in the wind. Still, he followed them, always trailing behind, eyes wide with wonder and stubbornness.’

A pause, and the voice trembled as if holding something too heavy to carry.

‘One evening, when the sun dipped low, and shadows stretched long across the earth, the brothers came back from hunting. But the boy was not with them. They searched, called his name, but there was no answer. He had snuck out, like he always did, thinking he could follow them, prove he was strong. Their mother . . . she was frantic, screaming his name, tearing at her hair. She knew there were wild things out there, creatures with teeth sharp as knives, eyes that glowed in the dark.’

The ship creaked as if responding. The water rose higher.

‘But it wasn’t just beasts with claws they feared. There were other things – white demons, we called them. Men who walked like shadows, who could take a child in the blink of an eye, and he’d be gone. Stolen away, as if he had never existed. They searched through the night, through the tangled brush, over rocks and streams, but they found nothing. Not even a single footprint. It was as if the earth had swallowed him whole.’

The voice softened, drifting like a breeze, and then grew stronger, carrying a new ache – hope.

‘They did not stop searching,’ the voice continued. ‘Far into the next day, they combed through the forest, called his name, listened for any sign, any whisper. And then, just as the sun began to set, they found him. He was sitting with his back against a tree, a porcupine in his lap, its spines bristling like a thousand tiny spears. His hands were a mess of cuts, raw and bleeding, but he didn’t flinch, didn’t pull away. His fingers moved carefully, plucking out the spines one by one, determined to skin the creature.

‘What are you doing?’ his brothers asked, relieved and frightened. And the boy, small and scrawny, looked up with eyes that held a quiet fire. ‘A hunter feeds his people,’ he said. ‘I wanted to bring something back, like you do. I can do it. I can help.’

They watched him, this boy with bloody hands, the porcupine slipping between his fingers, and they realized he had never been lost. He had been searching too, not for a way home, but for a way to prove he belonged. And in that moment, they saw not a child, but a warrior – one who might be small, but had a heart that was fierce, and hands that would not stop, even when they were trembling, even when they bled.

They carried him home, the porcupine tucked under his arm, and the whole village gathered to see. No one laughed. No one called him a reed. They saw his hands and understood what courage looked like. From that day, he was never left behind. For a hunter was not just the one who brought the biggest prey, but the one who would not give up, even when the task was painful, even when his hands bled.’

The voice softened to a whisper. ‘Sometimes, we are lost, not because we have wandered, but because we are searching. And sometimes, what we find is not what we thought we would, but it is enough. It is always enough.’

The water continued to rise, reaching our chests and necks, but the man speaking did not flinch. Slowly, he shifted, revealing a glint of metal in his hand, small and sharp, stained dark with old blood. ‘The boy was not the only one who learned to keep going,’ he said. ‘I carried this for weeks, hidden in the wound of my sole, waiting for a moment to set myself free. And tonight, I have.’

The metal shard slipped from his fingers, tapping the wooden floor with a muffled clink. It had done its job, prying at the links of his chains until they gave way. ‘A hunter feeds his people,’ he murmured, his eyes gleaming with a quiet, steady light. ‘And a warrior, no matter how small, finds a way.’

A murmur passed through us – a spark, faint but real. Deep in the belly of the ship, we started to hope again.

Our world did not end, you see. It bent, it broke, but it did not end. The sea could claim our bodies, but it could not drown the stories that held us, nor the spirit that kept us breathing.

We are still here, still breathing, still alive in our stories. They could not take that.

    "text": "I loved the anonymous chat app. I downloaded it on my computer. I downloaded it on my phone. I was lonely, and the anonymous chat app made me less lonely. I couldn’t sleep, and the anonymous chat app said, Who cares! When I felt helpless, when I despaired, when my breath caught horribly in my chest, the anonymous chat app told me: The whole world suffers. Everyone is unemployed. The whole world is sexless inside of its body. The whole world longs for sleep. When it sleeps, the whole world has terrible nightmares. And when it wakes, the whole world is so, so grateful for the opportunity to chat privately with strangers online.

The anonymous chat app sported a clean and gorgeous interface. Its colors were green and blue and white. The font, serif-less. Everything glowed, comforting and familiar, like a chain hotel. At the end of each session I watched the chat window melt away, pixels dissolving, irretrievable. I knew all the lingo. A/S/L. Bots telling me to add them on a different messenger app called Kik. I wasn’t stupid. I didn’t use Kik. But I liked the bots anyway; it was cool that they were fake, and cool that I knew they were fake, and cool that whoever designed the bots probably knew that I would know they were fake and want to talk to them anyway.

The first time I chatted with a bot I just wanted to see what would happen.

Hello, I typed.

I love you, I typed.

Im gonna kill you, I typed.

And the bot said:

gtg, add me on kik ; )

gtg, add me on kik ; )

gtg, add me on kik ; )

 

Whenever I was connected to a real person we would exchange age and sex and location and then either I or the other person would say How are you and then one of us would say Are you horny. I lied about my age and I lied about my location and I lied about being horny. The only thing I didn’t lie about was my gender. I’m Henry, I said. I’m Geoff. I said that I was twenty-five. I said that I was forty-seven. I said that I lived in Detroit or Toronto or Berlin. I said that I was horny, really horny, extremely horny. Most of the time I didn’t masturbate. Anyone could be a fat old guy getting off on tricking me, and I worried about what it would mean to fondle myself while aware of this possibility.

Besides, I wasn’t horny. When I looked down at my body, I was often surprised to find that it was still there. All day long my body dragged me around. It sat me on the couch. It took me to the bathroom. In exchange I gave it food and water and rest. Sometimes I gave it drugs, and sometimes I made it lift heavy objects and set them down so that it could stay strong. But I continued to suspect that my body was angry with me. Nothing I did seemed good enough. I was angry with my body, too. It was holding me back.

Here was the truth: I was a thirty-four-year-old male. I lived in Brooklyn Heights. I was 6’1. I was a healthy weight. I had a nice-looking face. I had money. I wore brown loafers and chinos. I wanted to be free. I wanted to be a mind.

 

I was in the bathroom one evening, sitting on the toilet with my pants on and my laptop balanced on my thighs, waiting for the chat app to pair me with someone new. My wife was out on a run. Earlier I had considered taking the subway to a bar in Gowanus, but then I remembered the dirty drifts of last week’s snowfall piled at every intersection, and I thought about all of the strangers and all of the bots out there, all over the world, waiting to meet me. So instead I sat in the bathroom, sipping a canned margarita from the deli across the street, and took some selfies on my laptop camera.

Everything was fine. I had washed the sheets that morning. My wife and I had recently purchased an expensive toaster oven, known for its innovative crisping technology, and I had developed the habit of cutting frozen pizzas in half with scissors and broiling each segment separately. This technique was much faster than waiting for the real oven to preheat. A half-moon of pepperoni pizza rested on a paper towel in the bathroom sink, and once it cooled down it was going to taste delicious.

I should have prefaced this by saying that I loved my wife. She was beautiful. She was smart. She had a low, calm voice. We met at a Starbucks six years earlier and at our wedding reception we gave out personalized ceramic Starbucks travel tumblers. Aww, the guests had said, and they were right. The personalized ceramic Starbucks travel tumblers were adorable. My wife was Jewish and in law school, but she wasn’t argumentative, not really. She was small, with long dark hair that she parted in the middle to appear more authoritative. She wore these tight black skirt suits to work. At home she zoomed around the kitchen muttering to herself. Fuck, where did I put my keys, fuck fuck fuck god damn it has anyone seen my keys, did I forget to put on deodorant, shit shit I think I smell. I loved listening to her curse. The words sounded wrong coming out of her sweet, earnest mouth.

Whenever I looked at my wife it was as if my intestines got caught in my throat. The previous year I had participated in several unsatisfying affairs when she was away visiting her dying mother upstate. I had still been sort of horny back then, but that wasn’t why I cheated. I did it because my wife was having a hard time. ‘I’m so sad. Fuck! I’m so fucking sad!’ she would say, and her eyes would be red and wet, and I would hear her gasping and crying all over the apartment. In these moments it was clear that she had made a terrible mistake in marrying me. I didn’t know how to make her feel better; I didn’t even want to try. I’m so horrible, I told myself. I’m a piece of shit. I’m the kind of piece of shit who would probably cheat on his wife while her mother was dying.

The first time she went upstate I headed to a bar and picked up a girl, and the next time she went upstate I did it again. I always went back to the girls’ places. I didn’t want my doorman to see that I was unfaithful. The girls lived in Bushwick and Bed-Stuy, in filthy walk-ups with four roommates, hordes of ugly potted plants lunging for sunlight in the common areas, empty cans of diet Red Bull repurposed as ashtrays on the windowsills. I was aware that when those girls fucked me it was sort of as a joke. They wanted to laugh with their friends about my pressed trousers, my polished shoes, my pomade. I didn’t care. I had a lot of affection for them. I was pathetic, but they were, too. One had a big fat roach living in her bathtub drain, and it would pop out whenever someone went to pee. She was too scared to kill it and had instead trained herself to think of it as a pet. She was nuts, but I liked her, and I felt guilty when her blow job didn’t make me come.

Then my wife’s mother died and I stopped going home with girls. My body screamed at me all the time. Stop! it screamed. Go! I became very depressed. For a while I had panic attacks at the office every time my computer froze. I would stare at the unmoving screen and think, Nothing ever works and everybody is going to die. Then my heart would start flapping around inside of me at an awful speed. I would plead with my body, Do not do this while I am at work! and my body would laugh in my face. Eventually my company put me on paid leave. My wife was kind and supportive. She reminded me to take my Ativan.

In the bathroom I sipped my margarita and stared at the blank chat window on my laptop. Whoever was on the other end wasn’t saying anything, so I typed, A/S/L??

The stranger took a moment to respond. I steadied my laptop with one hand and with the other reached into the sink for my pizza.

MY CAPS LOCK IS STUCK

I HAVE REMOVED THE KEY AND CLEANED IT AND RESTARTED MY COMPUTER BUT NOTHING IS WORKING

Sorry, I typed. I dont know how to help . . . a/s/l??

THATS OKAY I JUST DONT WANT YOU TO THINK I AM YELLING AT YOU

MY NAME IS DIANE I AM A FEMALE I AM 37 YEARS OLD AND I LIVE IN QUEENS

My fingers thrummed on the keyboard. This person had no idea how to use the internet. And even though she had explained about the caps lock, it still came across as yelling. Plus, I didn’t generally like to talk to anyone over thirty-five. Ever since my thirty-fourth birthday I had sensed myself on a slippery, frightening edge.

I was about to disconnect when she messaged me again.

PLEASE DONT LEAVE. I REALLY NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO. I AM GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE. MY HUSBAND LEFT ME FOR A YOUNGER AND MORE ATTRACTIVE WOMAN. I DONT KNOW WHAT I DID TO DESERVE THIS. I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT I AM A DANGER TO MYSELF. IF ONE MORE PERSON LEAVES ME I WILL PROBABLY KILL MYSELF. I DO HAVE A BOTTLE OF SLEEPING PILLS. I AM SORRY FOR PUTTING YOU IN A DIFFICULT POSITION. DIANE

I set my pizza back down in the sink. This was not what the anonymous chat app was all about. I didn’t want to be responsible for anyone’s suicide. Then again, she was likely lying about killing herself. Recently, I had also told my wife that I was going to buy a gun on the dark web and shoot myself in the throat so that I would no longer be a burden. I needed to make sure she was aware that she could lose me at any moment, that it was still her responsibility to love me, even though I had become a helpless and bitter person.

I got up off the toilet and lay down in the bathtub with the laptop on my stomach. The sensation of the cold ceramic against my neck made me feel miserable but alive.

HELLO??

Sorry, I was in the bathroom, I typed. You should call the suicide hotline.

I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO CALL THEM BECAUSE I KNOW IT IS THEIR JOB TO TELL ME NOT TO KILL MYSELF

IT ALL STARTED WITH MY MOTHER WHO NEVER LOVED ME AND RESENTED ME UNTIL THE DAY SHE DIED. BECAUSE OF HER I HAVE DEVELOPED AN ANXIOUS-PREOCCUPIED ATTACHMENT STYLE. I DRIVE EVERYONE AWAY WITH MY INSECURITIES AND HYPER-DEPENDENCE

AT FIRST I THOUGHT MY HUSBAND WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WHEN REALLY HE WASNT BUT I KEPT CONFRONTING HIM ABOUT IT UNTIL HE FINALLY HAD AN AFFAIR FOR REAL ISNT THAT CRAZY

Damn, I typed. Your husband sucks!!

She kept going. Her husband had left her four months ago and she sometimes got lonely at night but didn’t want to talk to people she knew, because she hated when they felt sorry for her. I felt really sorry for her. She was much crazier and sadder than I was, had a worse life, and kept apologizing, over and over again. It was nice talking to her.

I thought, Maybe I can do something. Maybe I can make this insane lady feel better. Maybe this is my job.

So I told her some lies about myself. I said I was an orphan. I said that dating was hard for me because I was ugly.

ALL THOSE GIRLS DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY’RE MISSING, she said.

I thought, Good thing she doesn’t know I’m actually handsome.

I was about to reply when I heard a knock on the bathroom door.

‘Baby?’ my wife said. ‘You okay?’

‘I’m just chilling in here,’ I said loudly. ‘Might take a bath.’

‘Sounds good,’ she said, in a voice that meant: It doesn’t sound good, it sounds weird, there’s no water running, it kind of smells like pizza, but I’m patient, I’m nice, I love you, I’m your wife.

When I heard her footsteps recede, I returned to the screen. It was getting late. My back felt sore. My canned margarita was warm and my pizza was cold. But I didn’t want to stop talking to Diane. I was helping her. It was so good to be helpful. The more I helped her, the more I wanted her to help me, too. I wanted to tell her things, true things, about myself. And I did. I sat up in the bathtub and typed quickly, hunched over my laptop. I told Diane about how my company had recently made the move into a coworking space in the city, with ping-pong tables and a booth in the lobby where you could craft your own Christmas ornaments. There was a bar and lounge area, and a room where people danced to music wearing headphones. I had encouraged the move so as to increase staff wellness and productivity, but once we arrived I started having panic attacks after drinking one beer at the bar on my lunch break. I told her how the panic attacks continued even after I stopped drinking my lunchtime beer, and how one day I began shrieking in the lobby and then smashed my handmade ornament on the floor and that’s why I got put on leave. I didn’t tell her the leave was paid because I didn’t want to make her feel insecure about our class disparity.

I AM SORRY YOU ARE OUT OF WORK

IN MY STATE I FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD DOWN A JOB

That blows, I typed. You deserve so much better.

It was two in the morning when we both logged off. We exchanged emails, mine with a fake name that I had set up for such situations. My eyeballs felt stretched out from staring at my screen all night. Ow, my body said, and I said, Shut the fuck up. When I stood up from the bathtub my muscles were stiff and cramped. But there was something else, too – a slackness in the vicinity of my ribcage that I hadn’t experienced in months. A feeling like a fist opening.

Diane, I thought.

My wife lay sprawled on top of our white duvet. She was wearing two sweaters, fleece-lined sweatpants, and a pair of sparkly, fuzzy socks. I lay beside her, and she shifted to wrap her thin arms around my waist. Her breath was wet on my neck. It smelled like sour milk. Recently my wife had got into intermittent fasting and she only ever ate one meal a day, at 7 p.m., but every day at 7 p.m. she microwaved the greasiest foods she could find: mac and cheese, corn dogs, soggy hamburgers that steamed offensively in their cellophane packets. At 6.55 p.m. she would spread everything out on the kitchen table and look at it and nod and say, ‘Fuck yes. Hell fucking yes.’ And then I would watch her shovel down her burgers and corn dogs and laugh, and go, ‘Shit, I’m gonna get heartburn,’ and take three Tums and one Lactaid, and, later, massage her swollen stomach on the couch while concentrating on a Scandinavian crime drama, expressing shock at the appropriate moments, shaking her head, saying, ‘That is fucked up.’ When I watched her I could almost forget about my horrible body, the twisting, grasping panic inside of me, the Ativan, the other women, the strangers, the bots. I could almost forget about the gorgeous anonymous chat app, which was always within reach, always waiting for me, on my laptop, on my phone.

I could almost say, I love being a husband. I love my beautiful wife.

Beside me in bed, a loose strand of hair had caught in my wife’s mouth. She was kneading her lips, pushing at the hair with her tongue. I closed my eyes and the image of her face went black, like my phone’s screen when untouched. It was not a face I could bear to see.

Instead I thought, Diane.

 

The next morning I saw that my wife had left me a note on her pillowcase.

Hooray!!! it said. You slept!!

She had sketched a horizontal stick figure with little Zs floating above its head. I stared at it for a minute. It looked just like me. I pushed away the vision of my wife’s fingers grasping the fine-tipped pen, pressing delicately into the pad. In my dreams my phone had been buzzing interminably against my thigh. It had been bleating Diane’s name. I glanced around the room. My skin tingled where it sat on top of my muscles. My muscles throbbed where they sat on top of my bones. There was a spider in the corner of the ceiling, and I kept looking at it and crying. I had been listening to a lot of Steely Dan. I couldn’t understand why the spider hadn’t spun a web. It was in the corner with no web. I felt guilty about every affair I had ever had. I was letting down my wife and all of her friends. I didn’t have friends anymore, but if I did, I would have been letting them down, too. And not just the friends I might have had. I was letting down all the strangers and all the wonderful bots in the world. I was letting down my new confidante, Diane.

I lurched out of bed and took my Ativan and chugged half a bottle of cold brew, then stood in the middle of the kitchen and waited for the drug to hit, that first surge of relief like a wet rag being wrung out in my brain. I looked around at our apartment. My wife had decorated in various shades of gray: slate, charcoal, a luminescent pearl for the kitchen cabinets. In the living room were a handwoven viscose rug in a color called Fog and a low-slung linen couch with a burnt orange throw arranged artfully across one cushion. The throw was cashmere, and in the early hours I liked to swaddle myself in it front-to-back, like an armless Snuggie. Our kitchen table was Danish and modern. My wife had let me pick it out. ‘I have veto power,’ she had said, ‘in case you choose something ugly.’ But I didn’t choose something ugly, and when she saw the table she had looked shiny and proud, like a mother whose kid had received unexpectedly kind comments on his report card.

‘My sister’s going to shit herself when she sees how nice our place is,’ she had said.

I opened the fridge and found a Tupperware on the top shelf filled with hardboiled eggs. My wife had cracked the shells lightly beforehand, so all I had to do was peel. I pictured her running the eggs under cold water in the early morning, tapping them gently on the countertop until their exteriors fissured while I was asleep. My eyes welled up. I chipped away at the shell, then peeled the egg by its membrane and popped it whole into my mouth.

I lay on the couch with my head against the scratchy side of a throw pillow and opened my laptop. Outside it was below freezing, but we kept the heat at 75, even in midwinter. My wife was always cold and sometimes went to sleep wearing her knee-length down parka.

The laptop fan whirred frighteningly. The underside of the keyboard was warm on my bare legs. Too hot, my body said. I closed the laptop and opened it again, but the fan wouldn’t stop. I threw the computer down onto the cushion. The fan shut off. Gingerly I pried the laptop open and began to draft an email.

 

Dear Diane,

I forgot to tell you yesterday to try listening to some Steely Dan. I would recommend starting with the 1972 album Can’t Buy a Thrill. I have found it very comforting in my lowest moments.

It was really great talking to you last night. Lately I’ve been feeling very confused. I feel like I’m going crazy. I hope you are doing better this morning. I think that you should flush your sleeping pills. Do you ever feel sexually lonely now that your divorce is underway?

Please get back to me ASAP.

Best,
Ken

 

I hit send and immediately started refreshing my empty inbox. I thought about the eggs. I thought about how so many people in the world were married and so many people in the world were not. I thought about the hundreds of thousands of users on the anonymous chat app, and how many of them were uglier than me, and how many were more handsome, and how many had more money, and how many had less, and how many were horny, and how many were frigid, and then my body said, You need to stop thinking about this or else you are going to have a panic attack.

I thought about Diane. I thought about what she might smell like. I imagined her apartment in Queens, probably un-renovated since the 1972 release of Can’t Buy a Thrill. I imagined yellowed bathroom tiles and wall-to-wall carpeting smudged with weird, unidentifiable stains, and an ugly black velour couch with potato chip crumbs lodged between the cushions. I imagined walking in and saying, Wow, it looks great in here, I love the decor, and how happy she would be to hear that. I thought about her puckered breasts hanging limpidly beneath a dirty tank top, my fingers tracing the flesh that protruded over her sweatpants, slipping under the band, grabbing a fistful of her pubic hair.

My cell phone buzzed. It was my boss. I sent him to voicemail, waited for the message to come through, and deleted it.

I called my wife, even though I knew she couldn’t pick up at work. I pressed the phone hard against my ear.

The phone said, ‘Please leave a message after the tone.’

‘Hey,’ I said. ‘It’s me.’

I hung up. I called again. The ringing sounded like what I imagined those meditation singing bowls must sound like, not so much a noise as a dull, low throb at the back of the skull.

 

The next morning I woke up frenzied and strung out. In bed I checked my laptop; Diane had yet to respond. I had spent most of the previous night hiding out in the bathroom, connecting and reconnecting to strangers on the anonymous chat app, failing to find her, until I stumbled to bed around two.

My wife was awake in the kitchen, slathering a toasted bagel with low-fat cream cheese for me. I had forgotten that it was the weekend. She poured herself a mug of coffee and measured out a few drops of stevia, then sat across from me at the table, handing me my Ativan bottle. I heard the pills rattling around like seeds. I was getting low.

‘What were you dreaming about last night?’ my wife asked. She looked beautiful in her silk bathrobe. Her hair was frizzy and pulled up in a clip. Behind her reading glasses I could see bits of yellow crust fuzzing the corners of her eyes.

‘I wasn’t dreaming,’ I said. ‘I didn’t sleep.’

She took a sip of her coffee and sucked it through her teeth before swallowing. ‘Yes, you did. I woke up for a minute at four and you were sleeping.’

‘No, I was just pretending to sleep so you wouldn’t worry,’ I said.

‘You were twitching and screaming,’ my wife said.

‘I wish you wouldn’t confuse your dreams with reality,’ I said, and then I laughed to say, Ha ha, you always do this! You’re so crazy! My crazy wife!

Her mouth tightened. ‘Okay,’ she said. She finished her coffee and started toward the dishwasher, then turned back and pointed at my untouched bagel. ‘Are you going to eat that?’

‘Yes,’ I said. I looked at the bagel. Something sour rose up in my throat.

‘If you don’t,’ she said, ‘if you change your mind, will you wrap it in aluminum and put it in the fridge? Instead of leaving it out or throwing it away? I’ll eat it for dinner.’

My body said, Don’t eat that bagel, it’s going to make you throw up. My wife looked at me like, I’m a good wife, I’m so patient, I’m so loving, even though my husband is a piece of shit. I picked up the bagel and tore off a hunk with my molars. The cream cheese spread like glue in my mouth. I forced myself to chew until it was soft enough to swallow. A wad of wet bread lodged in my throat. I went in for another bite.

‘Jack, what the fuck?’ my wife said.

‘I have to go to the bathroom,’ I said. I went to the bathroom and turned on the faucet, then knelt in front of the porcelain toilet bowl and stared into the still, clear water. You are a monk, I thought. You are meditating. My stomach roiled but I didn’t puke. When I rose I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. My face was the face of a ghost. My eyes were bleary and red. My chin was bloated and there were gleaming pink pustules dotting my throat. I looked very bad. I looked insane.

I heard a soft knock at the bathroom door.

‘Are you okay?’ My wife asked. ‘Can I get you some water?’

‘I’m fine,’ I screamed.

When she spoke again her voice was shrill. ‘Shut up! Just shut the fuck up! Be fucking normal! What the fuck do you do in the bathroom all the time! Jesus fucking Christ! I am trying so fucking hard over here!’

I noticed that I was sitting on the floor. This is where I want to be, said my body. My chest clenched. My hands vibrated. My body said, She’ll be sorry she yelled at you, she’ll feel terrible, and then it said, How about some more Ativan?

Okay, I thought. It’s time for me to say some crazy shit.

I said, ‘I want you to leave this house. I need you to walk out the door and stay away for at least three nights. I need to be alone so that I can breathe. I’m getting tired of your delusions. I don’t know how to help you.’

I was glad there was a closed door between us. I didn’t want to watch her eyes grow wet, the little pink shock of her mouth opening. I didn’t want to think about her doing nice things for me, like toasting my bagel. I didn’t want to remember how we had once talked about having two kids, but would end up having zero kids, because nothing in the world would leave me alone. My body wouldn’t leave me alone and my brain wouldn’t leave me alone. My job wouldn’t leave me alone. The spider on the bedroom ceiling wouldn’t leave me alone.

My wife said, ‘Fuck you.’

I waited until I heard her leave the apartment. I splashed cold water on my face and opened my email.

 

Dear Diane, I wrote.

I don’t want to accuse you of anything but I am feeling a little used. If you are alive please respond to me. I miss you.

Best wishes,
Ken

 

I dragged a flattering photo of myself from my photo library into the message body. In the background you could make out some of the colorful, modern canvases my wife had hung without frames on the living room walls. Diane would see that I was attractive with a well-decorated apartment.

I refreshed my email, then closed my laptop and took an Ativan. I was excruciatingly bored and, at the same time, restless and agitated, as if my blood was pumping too quickly through the canals of my veins. I thought, I am capable of having fun. I am a handsome young man. I’m single! I went to the kitchen and swallowed a second Ativan. I could feel my insides sloshing around, wetly and warmly. I looked down at my hands and thought, Incredible! Skin! There was skin all over me, holding me together inside of the atmosphere. As long as I had skin, everything would stay in place. My guts would not fall out into a slimy red pile on the floor. I was overcome with gratitude and feelings of celestial wellbeing. I checked on the spider in the bedroom. He was doing well. He looked really happy.

I connected my phone to the speaker my wife had bought for my thirty-first birthday, put on Can’t Buy a Thrill, and turned the volume up to seventeen.

I was singing along and feeling great. I even jumped up and down a few times. I hoped that my neighbors would hear and sing along and feel good, too. I just wanted to make other people happy. That was all I had ever wanted. That was all I had ever tried to do for Diane.

I swayed my hips and poked at my phone. One new text from my wife. She was sorry she had snapped at me. I swiped. I scrolled. Maybe some space would be good, she said. I blocked her number. I imagined her standing next to me in the kitchen, putting her hair up and then taking it down. I imagined myself screaming, How could you do it? How could you abandon me? How could you leave me alone with my body? You’ll never get the apartment!

And I imagined her crying, saying, I’m so sorry! I’m so sorry I treated you like that when you’re clearly going through a difficult period! I love you so much! Nothing you could ever do would make me mad at you! Even if you cheated on me more than three times! Please forgive me!

I sank onto the couch. Where could she be going? Maybe her sister’s house in Jersey. I smiled thinking about my wife alone in a guest bedroom, bickering with her sister’s husband about the heat, secretly cranking up the thermostat at night, commuting into the city each morning on NJ transit, changing into her heels in a sticky Penn station bathroom. She was getting older every day. The lack of vitamins was starting to show in the whites of her eyes. I laughed and got off the couch and grabbed a broom. I went into my bedroom and tried to smash the spider with the broom handle, but it escaped me, scurrying crazily across the ceiling. I threw the broom to the floor. I thought about my life. My life went something like this:

I love you!

Don’t leave me!

Get out!

Gtg!

Add me on Kik!

I lay on the bed and closed my eyes. The mattress supported my body. My skin remained in its place. I stayed like that for a few minutes. I was ready, but I wanted to hold on, if only for another moment.

When I opened my eyes I felt perfectly calm. I went into the bathroom and shook my final Ativan into my hand. I had forgotten to pick up my refill, but I knew it wouldn’t be a problem. I was getting well. I washed my face with my wife’s jelly cleanser and ran a comb through my hair and tended to my beard with an electric trimmer. I clipped my nails into the toilet and flushed. I patted rosehip toner onto my cheeks and forehead. I checked the mirror. I was looking solid and handsome, en route to extreme health. My chin already appeared less bloated. I returned to the bedroom and rifled through the closet. I put on clean chinos and a hunter green Oxford button-down. I opened my laptop’s lid.

 

Dear Diane, I wrote,

It’s been such a pleasure getting to know you. I was wondering if you believe that digital mediation has gone too far. Do you have faith in the possibility of seeing and being seen? I forgot to mention that I am going through a devastating and messy divorce from my beautiful Jewish wife.

It would be nice if you came and stayed here for a while. Do you like smoothies? I just ordered a very powerful new blender. I would be happy to pay for your movers, a cab, anything you need.

Looking forward to seeing you tonight!

All the best,
Ken

 

I added a postscript with my address and apartment number. I called down to the doorman to tell him that a woman would be arriving soon with luggage and to send her right up.

I shut down my computer and turned off my phone. I sat at the kitchen table and waited. The sun cast slats of shimmering light across the granite countertop.

I thought, That’s the ugliest thing I’ve ever seen.

 

I woke up with my right cheek pressed against the table and that side of my face covered in drool. It was dark, and I couldn’t remember what day it was. I turned on the overhead light and checked the time. Only six in the evening. I splashed some water on my face. More Ativan, my body screamed. I wanted to explain that I couldn’t, that there was no more, but my body didn’t understand reason or logic. My body offered no sympathy. It did not pity the circumstances of my existence. Ativan, it screamed. I pressed a hand over each ear. My brain was pudding in my skull. Slowly I inched my way over to the couch. I checked my email. Nothing from Diane.

I flipped on the TV and landed on one of the crime shows my wife liked. I couldn’t figure out what was going on. There was a large boat. There was a vicious sex-trafficker. There were vast expanses of gray water. I lay on the couch and wrapped myself in the blanket, dozing. I thought, Diane, you bitch.

Around eight I was jolted awake by a series of loud knocks at the front door. My head throbbed. I straightened my shirt and stumbled over.

In the hallway stood a girl, 18 or 19, wearing platform boots and knee-length denim shorts over a pair of ripped fishnet tights. She was skinny except for a slight thickness around the thighs, dimples at the sides of her hips. Her hair appeared to have been cheaply bleached, dark and oily at the roots, and she had arched, drawn-in eyebrows, a scary amount of purple eyeshadow smeared out and around her lower lid. She looked Greek, maybe, or Armenian, and would have been pretty if she scraped off her makeup. She was sucking on some kind of pungently fruity hard candy. Her eyes were a warm shade of brown. They frightened me.

‘Nice place,’ she said.

‘Thanks,’ I said. I peeked around her to see that she hadn’t brought any luggage. She sidled past me, not noticing or caring when her small breasts brushed my torso, and tossed a worn-out tote bag onto the kitchen table. She scanned the room, made a satisfied clicking sound with her tongue, and dropped onto the couch. With both hands she unzipped her boots, then placed them neatly on the floor, kicking her legs up and onto the ottoman. Her tights cut off at the ankles. She had small, dainty feet.

I was so thirsty. I wanted to vomit. My face felt like it was not my face. My face felt like it was maybe an old mound of Play-Doh.

My eyes landed on the girl’s toenails, which were painted black, with a glittery green star pasted on each big toe.

One part of me thought, Get this person the fuck out of your house. Call your wife. Say sorry. Tell her you’re sick. Tell her you’re crazy. Tell her you will finally complete that self-help workbook on black-and-white thinking. Fall onto your knees, you stupid motherfucker. Find God.

But another part of me thought, Ha ha! Fuck you! Maybe later!

I walked toward the girl. With every step I thought, My legs are like big sloppy tree trunks. I must have had a weird expression on my face because she started giggling. I could smell the laugh leaking out of her mouth, extending itself towards me.

‘I know,’ she said. ‘I look young for my age.’ She stored the candy in one side of her mouth while she spoke. It pressed against the inside of her cheek, a tumor that shifted from side to side when she parted her lips.

‘Do you want something to drink?’ I asked stupidly. My legs continued to carry me in her direction. The more I looked at her the more her face seemed to swim away from me. I searched her eyes for a hint of Diane.

‘Can I have a tissue?’

Slowly I made my way to the kitchen. I grabbed a paper towel and handed it to her. She spat out a tiny, translucent candy shard, then gave the crumpled towel back to me. I didn’t know what to do with it, so I shoved it in my chinos pocket. I wished that I could sit down next to her and lay my head in her lap, but my body couldn’t remember how to do anything except stand there, staring.

‘I don’t think you’re Diane,’ I said finally. Then I said, ‘Do you happen to have any Ativan?’

She looked at me sadly. ‘No, I don’t.’ She got up off the couch and walked toward me, then stopped when our faces were six inches apart. Her skin smelled like cigarettes and lemon-scented cleaning supplies. I wanted to reach out and peel the cracking foundation off her face in strips.

‘You’re too young. You’re too young and I don’t think you’re going through a divorce,’ I said.

She crossed her arms over her small chest. ‘If you don’t believe me, then I’ll just leave.’ She reached for her boots.

‘No!’ I said. ‘No, don’t go. I believe you.’

She shook her head. ‘Ken,’ she said, ‘this is never going to work if you don’t trust me. We have to trust each other. Trust is the foundation of love. Are you listening?’

I studied her face. I looked around my clean, well-decorated apartment. I thought, There is no way she is Diane.

Then my body said, Maybe she will give you a massage, though. Maybe she really likes you.

‘Yes,’ I said.

‘I’m here to help you. That’s all I’ve ever wanted to do.’

‘Okay,’ I said.

‘First, we have to get you cleaned up. Where’s your bathroom?’

‘It’s right around the corner,’ I said.

I watched the net of her tights digging into her calves as she went off in search of the room. When she found it, she smiled at me and closed the door behind her. I heard the brief rush of her piss, then the toilet flush and the bathwater running. After a while, she came back out and beckoned me towards her.

I followed her into the bathroom. It was humid and foggy with steam. The scent of lavender and lemongrass hung heavy over the tub, cut through by the faint grassy odor of urine. I glanced at the trash and saw that she had used up my wife’s bath salts.

‘Take off your clothes,’ she said, still smiling. I hesitated, then peeled off my chinos and my boxer briefs. I tried not to look at my penis hanging limp between my thighs. She helped me unbutton my shirt and lifted it over my head.

‘Good,’ she said. ‘Now get in.’

I stepped into the tub and stood submerged up to my calves, waiting for my body to adjust to the heat. The water felt slippery around my legs. I lowered myself slowly, crouching at first like a dog taking a shit, then letting myself lie down fully. The bathwater came up to my chin.

Diane nodded at me from above. ‘You stay here as long as it takes.’

‘Thanks,’ I said, and I moved my face into what I hoped could realistically be called a smile. I watched Diane kneel to gather my discarded clothes. I knew everything that was going to happen the moment before it happened. How she would leverage her weight against one hand, pushing herself from the tiles, reaching for the doorknob, my dirty underwear tucked under her armpit. And how I would raise myself onto my knees, my torso leaning out over the tub, my hand following her, straining, extending, dripping, the fingers wrapping around her left ankle and holding tight.

Diane’s mouth made the smallest sound I had ever heard. There was water on the floor. I felt her ankle churn in my fist. I looked at the hairs on the back of my arm, which were so beautiful, so silky and dark. Was Diane crying? No. No one here was crying. I had already let go. The door had already clicked shut.

I closed my eyes and sank back into the tub, loosening my jaw and parting my lips, letting the bathwater slide into my mouth. I heard a faint series of rustles and thumps from the kitchen, the opening and closing of drawers and cabinets, things banging into other things, things being moved, footsteps padding from room to room, things being thrown onto the floor, things being retrieved, unzipped, re-zipped. I made a mental inventory of all the objects around the apartment: my laptop, my wallet, my phone. It wasn’t true that trust was the foundation of love. Love had no foundation. It soared above me, untethered, an awful blimp. I heard paper rubbing against itself, Diane’s human exhale, Diane’s human voice saying shit, Diane’s human laugh, the front door opening, the front door closing. I could feel my pores widening, the dirt of my life washing out of me, rising with the steam and filtering through the ceiling vent. I reached above me for a bar of soap but it slipped from my wet hand. I watched it sink to the bottom of the tub before dipping my arm down to pick it up. I started to wash myself. The soap slid out of my hand once more.

Oh well, I thought.

I plunged my hand back into the water. I groped around.

I can’t find it, I thought. It’s gone.

But then I found it. I lifted it out of the water. I held on tight. I didn’t drop it again."

    "text": "She collected stamps when she was younger, then switched to books, degrees, and – when she moved abroad – white lovers. Later she returned to the familiar, and turned to teas. The careful, deliberate steps of preparing her tea became a habit, and, as with most habits, it was folded in with ingredients and histories preceding her.

She bought teas from regular stores and specialty houses, on errands to the local grocer and visits to her home island. Friends indulged her and added to her hodgepodge collection. Once, on her birthday, a lover took her on a surprise trip to the Davenport and Sons tea house, and she came back home with quite the loot. In this way, we grew into uneven rows of boxes and tins on her shelves, a dry garden tended by love and ritual.

Back home on her island, household altars were commonplace, erected in a special room in the house or assembled in a dedicated corner of the living room. Some altars housed statues and images of goddesses, garlanded with flowers. Others held pungent incense and the photographs and personal belongings of dear departed ones. Irreverently, Durga liked to think that her boxes and tins, fragrant and framed by a pell-mell of old teapots and chipped mugs, were her altar.

Then she gave us up. We know exactly when it happened.

It was when Durga came back from Dadi’s funeral in Mauritius. Her grandmother’s passing had emptied her heart of home, even as her travel bags were heavy with the familiar foods of her childhood. Sifting through them, she carefully removed a sealed envelope and an unassuming blue box labelled ‘Bois Chéri Vanilla Tea’. She placed both at the back of the shelves, behind the rest of us, hidden from view. She threw out the food. And then, as if the newcomers had tainted us with their presence, she avoided us for a long while. Almost a decade elapsed as we gathered dust and waited patiently.

Then Mama left the island and moved in with Durga, to the island in Massachusetts. The day she arrived, she dug out the blue box from behind the lot of us and proceeded to make tea in the same manner she had done every day of her life back in Mauritius. She flavoured it with cardamom pods, crushed lemongrass roots, and the Red Cow milk powder she had brought with her. A simple family recipe. The familiar hustle and bustle drew Durga to the kitchen. Mama had made her a cup without asking, which soothed and irked her in equal measure. She brought the cup to her lips and inhaled.

Durga had moved from island to island, up socially and away from familiarity, discarding everything except for her journals – and us. She started writing as a teenager, and kept the habit well into adulthood. Her journals recorded her life (les filles à l’école ont remarqué mes chaussures Nike, ça valait la peine d’avoir économisé mon argent de poche toute l’année; Rajiv m’a souri, je pense que je suis amoureuse; Durga  –  – , PhD!). And so did we. But the carefully constructed narratives, which Durga wrote in impeccable French and interspersed with exciting milestones, were not for us. Our domain is smells and associations, the quotidian and the transient. As we punctuate frantic mornings and lazy afternoons day after day, we modestly gather, in aromatic interstices between our leaves, the quiet intimacies of humans. We are no different from a beloved fruit from childhood, an old wooden toy, or the last song on a mixtape, lost and found again. We are easily forgotten. That is, until we remember.

As Durga inhaled the tea her mother had made her, its aroma bloomed into a remembrance as intense and engulfing as it was evanescent. A childhood memory, which had coalesced around the long-buried but instantly familiar fragrance of the tea, invaded her nostrils. Her body at once retracted and protracted into prepubescent angles, all knees and elbows. As the tea burned her throat, she was recalled into the body she used to inhabit, and the ways in which it had inhabited the world.

Bring water, loose leaf tea, five cardamom pods, and one crushed lemongrass root to boil in a small deksi. Add three teaspoons of milk powder, mix well, and remove from heat.

 

The kitchen is small and warm, the loud, flower-patterned curtains are open, and the tropical afternoon sunlight floods in through the window behind Mama. The smells of our old house in Riambel float around: fried fish, garlic and thyme, milk and cardamom, salt from the sea breeze. I do not yet know where one ends, and another starts. I will unfurl and catalogue them to make sense of the tangled threads of a lost archive, long after I have left my island.

I am back from school, ravenous. Usually, Mama makes pudinn vermisel for teatime. Today I smell gato franse. Like all the women in the neighbourhood, she borrows on credit throughout the month from boutikier sinwa, the grocer who keeps tabs in a large, tattered notebook: rice, oil, flour, and, when we start going to school, exercise books and pencils. Like most of the men, Papa drinks on credit from the local bar. At the beginning of every month, his pay is swallowed by the previous month. But occasionally, when there is still some money left, Mama buys gato franse like feuilleté custard, napolitaine, maspain – those local pastries with French names that are uniquely Mauritian and for which Muslim bakers on the island seem to have a special talent.

As she hands me tea and a napolitaine, I cannot quite see my mother for the light behind her, and I pray that she does not see the red shape imprinted on my cheek. Like all children at Permal Teeroovengadum Primary School, I know better than to tell my parents.

The teachers each have their own style, moulded by calculated sadism, dogmatic righteousness or blinding anger. They also have their own tools, hewn from dried bamboo culms, coconut fibre rods, or badamier stems. I sometimes imagine the Permal Teeroovengadum Primary School teachers taking a walk with their families on weekends and stopping in their tracks when they find just the right cane, as if waiting to be stripped of its leaves and polished.

When I am eight years old, in Standard 3, the lashes begin. I have been coddled enough the first two years of primary school, I am told. Monsieur Hassan’s cane, which he hides in a different place every time, appears out of nowhere and provides a swift lash for mistaking the French acute accent for the circumflex, or confusing Grande Rivière Sud-Est with Grande Rivière Nord-Ouest. No matter that we know the local names of our rivers, their depths and swells, like our own backyard. The cane disappears just as quickly as it appears. By the time the pain comes, the punishment has already ended, and relief taken over. Monsieur Hassan then makes a slightly clownish face, as if to mitigate our humiliation, or maybe his own discomfort towards what he believes he must do. He is the nicest out of the twelve schoolteachers.

Guru Manikam is not our teacher but often visits, unannounced, to chat with Monsieur Hassan. His enormous handlebar moustache twitches as his big red eyes scan the class. Once, they pause on Ahmad, who freezes. Guru Manikam beckons and Ahmad walks to the front of the class, eyes wide with silent terror. Guru hooks his index finger around Ahmad’s waistband, pulls it toward himself, and peers inside. He murmurs thoughtfully, as if deciding on which fish to pick at the market, or debating the merits of a particular rédaction. We collectively breathe a sigh of relief at not being Ahmad. Monsieur Hassan makes a clownish face and looks away.

The following year, Madame Ramsarai teaches Standard 4. She specializes in shaming rituals. When Preeti and Sarah-Anne, whom she forces to sit in the back and well away from everyone else, start chatting instead of following the lesson, she calls them to the front of the classroom. She pulls a chair close to her own desk, as if setting a stage. She sits Preeti in the chair, parts her hair gingerly with a pen, and shows Sarah-Anne the lice and nits. Sarah-Anne picks them between her index finger and thumb and quickly crushes them between her fingernails. They make a satisfying pop, and it makes Sarah-Anne smile. This goes on for a good half hour until it is her turn to sit and get her hair cleaned by Preeti. The rest of us look over to the spectacle from time to time, but mostly we carry on with our rédaction.

Madame knows that we do not quite fear her the same way we do her male colleagues, and she gets creative. Once, she tells us to wear our best uniforms, clean and ironed, for a dictée the following day. A dictée is a special occasion, after all, she says. And don’t forget to wear your best underwear, she adds, as we laugh. The next day, she calls to the front of the classroom all those who have omitted their silent t’s and d’s or have spelt –aux as –o. Their backs facing the rest of the class, the boys are asked to pull their pants down, and the girls to lift their skirts, before the obligatory lash on the buttocks for each mistake.

At the end of primary school, every child on the island competes in a national exam, and Monsieur Beekoo is our teacher for the last two years. His reputation precedes him. Out of the thousands who take the exam, his students regularly rank in the first five hundred, going on to join so-called star secondary schools. The rest go to regular schools, vocational schools, or no school at all. Monsieur has a panoply of punishments in his arsenal, and they flow out of frustration for the avoidable mistakes his favourites make – and indifferent disregard for the rest. When he asks me to conjugate the verb ‘instruire’ in the perfect tense, my tongue betrays me, skips over the pointed French u and flattens directly into the i so familiar in my native Creole. I feel the sting of the slap after he starts yelling, his face inches away from my own.

Like the teachers, the pupils each have their own style. Some jump and yelp, their eyes widening in surprise at every lash, their eyebrows disappearing into their hair. Others overdo the crying, hoping to soften the teacher’s heart, although we all know it never does. And then there are those who attempt to flee the lashes altogether, but with one arm in the teacher’s vice-like grip they only manage to dance in a revolving circle. I stand tall and silent, holding in my cries until my throat hurts more than the welts on my body.

I will soon leave for the Catholic secondary school Monsieur Beekoo and Mama wish for me. There will be no lashings there. It is, after all, a star school, one of the most respected. There we will mostly just suffer detention, either for wearing short skirts (Rule 7 from the Code of Conduct: the hem of the skirt needs to be at or below the knees and not reveal too much skin) or for speaking in Creole (Rule 2: only French allowed). Sometimes, when we fail to remember the main themes of Proust’s Du côté de chez Swann, a blackboard eraser is thrown in our general direction, easily dodged. And in my case, a teacher will replace my surname daily with funny ones from Voltaire’s Candide when doing roll call. I will stand tall and silent through it all, feeling no pain at all except for the strange one in my throat.

Presently Mama notices the red marks on my cheek, the ones left by Monsieur Beekoo. She promises not to tell Papa, but sits with me at night while I write lines: I conjugate ‘instruire’ in the present, perfect, and future tenses, and copy each ten times. I do not need my Bescherelle conjugation book. My written French is excellent, as Monsieur Beekoo himself tells me. When Mama gets up and starts to make tea for both of us, she tells me that I am lucky to be in school. She tells me that I need to focus and get an education, so I won’t be at my husband’s mercy one day. Or so I won’t end up even worse, like our neighbour: raising her daughters on her own, working night shifts in a tea factory where women are vulgar and curse in Creole – just like the men.

Bring water, tulsi leaves, and ginger slices to a boil. Remove from heat and strain. Add this water to your own waters, for the sake of your unborn child.

 

Water is primordial memory. My first memory, like my first water, is not my own, but Mama’s. It is of a time before I am born, stitched together from the bits and pieces my aunts share with me, weaved into my sense of self, the prologue to my story.

In this sepia-coloured memory, I imagine Mama to be very thin, not showing yet. The additional weight from carrying and birthing three daughters will come later. As will the calluses and cuts on her hands from cleaning and cooking: washing bed sheets and cloth diapers, grinding ginger, garlic, and masala with the small, rounded baby rock on the tall mama rock outside. When Papa yells, he says, bour to sime ale – get the fuck out. They have always rented, never owned, but he says, this is my house. When he yells, Mama thinks of her last day in school, the day before she turned fourteen. School was not free in pre-independence Mauritius, and her brothers were a better investment. She stayed at home to look after them, and to clean and to cook, wash clothes and grind spices. When Papa yells, to enn fam lakaz, you are a housewife, you do not work, she thinks of how she has had to work for men her whole life. But she does not say anything.

In my borrowed memory, she has one foot out the door of his rented house, as if about to leave. But she does not. Instead, she drinks the tulsi and ginger brew standing squarely in the doorway, putting all her hope in her unborn child.

I see all of this as if watching from outside that house in Riambel, hiding behind the hibiscus tree like a thief. The light in the house floods out of the doorway where Mama stands, and she is all chiaroscuro. I mostly see her movements in silhouette, but I imagine her standing tall and silent, and drinking in her tea.

When I am pregnant, Mama will make me a brew with tulsi leaves and ginger, and tell me that when she was pregnant, she used to stand in the doorway and drink the same concoction. Old women said that if she did this her son would be tall. You don’t have any sons, I will say back. And mama will laugh, as she often will after leaving the rented house and moving in with me. Me mo bann tifi edike, she will respond after a moment of reflection, giving in to my defiance. But my daughters are educated. And she will tell me that I am a professor of French because of her, that I am the tallest woman of the family because of her.

Pour hot water over tea sachet and let steep for five minutes. Add warm milk. Enjoy with a cucumber sandwich or scone.

 

I find a table at Quill and Ivy, the only tea room on campus. A few students around me are having tea and sandwiches, some of them working on their laptops or reading. Vandana, the only other Mauritian student I know at the university, works there part-time. She hands me a tea sachet in a handsome black-and-gold sleeve, next to a small creamer full of warm milk. The sleeve reads ‘Vanilla Comoros’. The vanilla bean, which gourmets associate with Bourbon (now Reunion Island) and Madagascar, looks dissonant in its pairing with the Comoros, these other islands of the Indian Ocean, even though it also grows there. I peer closer at the sachet, and presiding over the name, in smaller letters, I read: ‘Davenport and Sons Master Tea Blenders’. Even more intriguing and incongruous: the tropical, archipelagic tea is under the aegis of a staunchly New England name.

I am waiting for Nigel. I supplement my partial doctoral scholarship by tutoring high school and college kids. Nigel is neither. He is a musician who wants to speak French fluently, before his band tours the Caribbean with Martinican and Guadeloupean artists. While I ponder the disparate islands that conspire to bring us together – from Nigel’s touring locations to the implied provenances of my tea – he arrives. He waves, all smiles and ease. I find out that he is American despite his British name, and that he loves tea despite his country’s predilection for coffee. All these cultural nuances I have acquired in the five years I have lived here, at the same time shedding so many of my own. I have traded oiled-up tresses and dark skin turned ashy from skin-lightening creams for the sea-, sand- and sun-kissed images that dance in the eyes of most Americans when I tell them I am from an island.

I allow myself to flirt a little during those first months I tutor Nigel. He has a very easy, very white smile. The night he returns to Manhattan from Martinique he calls me, and I invite him to my apartment while my housemates are out. He smiles in the dim light of the bedroom, and I remember that his teeth are very straight, very white, somehow accentuated by his frayed sweater and faded jeans. He wears old clothes the way rich people do, a carefully curated aesthetics of poverty. I kiss his open smile then, taking it all in, the ways he has fucked and loved gorgeous men and women, the ways he owns spaces that push against mine, the not-quite-white of his Sicilian ancestors, laundered after Ellis Island, the unburden of his every day.

As he kisses me back, his greedy mouth searching for an opening, his hand slides down my stomach looking for the same, finding it quickly. I will his fingers in, revelling in the easy authority with which he moves in the world and in me. I turn my face and my aching throat to the wall, even as my sex pulls me toward his virtuoso fingers, all dexterity and controlled passion.

He stops then. His fingers, still inside, suddenly still. He puts his mouth to my ear and demands: I want to hear it. He has found my tongue, but does not find my voice. I stretch tall, silent, as I come in staccato, anticipating what his fingers are a proxy for. And desiring what his white teeth and blue eyes and accent are metonyms for.

When we have sex, my moans and postures are as deliberately arranged as my words. They come from years of watching Jason Priestley, Andie MacDowell, Shah Rukh Khan, and Rani Mukherjee speak love in English dubbed in French. The words I actually want to say never make it to my tongue, which has by now fossilized into pointed and squared morphologies. They escape me once in a while, but always outside of sexual intercourse. ‘Ayo,’ that protean sauce of an onomatopoeia that goes with every dish, comes first to express sheer pleasure, utter disappointment, and everything in between. Then ‘fouf’, more and more impatience. After a fight one day, something long forgotten almost escapes my lips: bour to sime ale. The painful knot in my throat alchemises the words and translates to Nigel: it’s over. He moves out of my apartment the same day. Although we break up on my terms, we say it in his words. That’s why it’s over.

I still go to the campus tea room. When Vandana sees me on my own, she comes over to chat and asks where Nigel is. I think of the long, intimate relationship language and sex have had in my bed, of the French we loved to flirt in and the Creole – Mauritian, Martinican or Guadeloupean – he never bothered to learn. But instead, I raise my voice and say, intending to shock: I don’t know how to say ‘Fuck me hard’ in Creole.

I expect Vandana to recoil or, at least, look away. Deadpan, she tells me how, and even adds her own spin on it. I recoil and look away. I have only ever heard these words used in violence toward women. They sting like a slap and their shape remains imprinted on my cheek for a while.

That night, the pleasure in my groin moves upward and explodes on my tongue, suddenly unsilenced, in words finally unviolenced.

Bour mwa for, ziska mo sousout bate.

I come as I breathe in the tea scent lodged in Vandana’s hair: Vanilla Comoros.

Vandana whose mother raised her on her own, working night shifts at a tea factory, cursing in Creole just like the men.

Vandana who is also her mother’s daughter.

Feast your eyes on the authentic vista of green tea bushes and local women picking tea while enjoying a tasting from the comfort of our colonial teahouse. Begin with our airy and refreshing vanilla tea, a favourite among customers, and end with the bold and complex Gold Label.

 

When I visit Dadi with Mama and Papa, I pretend not to like her, because Mama does not like her. Mama blames her mother-in-law for her husband’s temper. But Dadi knows how to win me over. She beckons to me with the hundred-rupee note she keeps hidden in the folds of her sari. She wraps my fist quickly around the note and urges me to hide it in my pocket, all the while whispering conspiratorially as if she is entrusting me with a treasure. She feeds me dal puri and tea with heaps of sugar. She swallows her own dal puri with a generous dose of arrack, but not before having poured a libation on the floor for Somoreeah. I laugh as she calls me Durga, rolling and trilling the r in her Mauritian Bhojpuri. I do not know Bhojpuri and she barely speaks Creole, but the way she says my name is another gift with which she tells me she loves me.

I like it most when Papa takes me, without Mama, to the plantation at the end of Dadi’s shift. Dadi puts me in the basket hanging on her back, on top of fresh tea leaves, so that I can see the large colonial house on the hill, beyond the rows of tea bushes on the Bois Chéri estate. There are people coming in and out of the house. Although they are the ones who look like ants, it is Papa who seems to become small next to me. I want to become small too, but on Dadi’s shoulders I am an extension of her strong, tall frame, and I cannot. The scent in her hair comforts me, as she silently picks tea to fulfil her quota.

Dadi started picking tea when she was nine. She picked tea twice as fast as her husband, earned more than him. And at home, she was twice as likely to lose her temper, especially after a few glasses of arrack. She would tell him bour to sime ale, get the fuck out of my house.

She stopped working on the tea plantation when she was seventy. But she did not lose the tea-picking basket, still weighing down her back despite its absence. When I visit from the US she walks toward me, bent almost at a right angle at the waist, the six-foot powerhouse that she once was now barely three feet tall, the height of a child. She unknots a corner of her sari and produces a hundred-rupee note for me, even while I protest that I am now a professor. She smiles, not understanding my words, my work, my world. But it does not matter when she hides the note in my hand and says my name.

The last time I visit Dadi before her death, she unknots a corner of her sari, but instead of the usual hundred-rupee note, she shoves into my hand a couple of pages, whispering in her usual way, gesturing for me to put them away.

A few days later, I stand in front of the pyre where Dadi lies as if sleeping. The eldest son or grandson traditionally lights the pyre, but Papa did not leave her any grandson, so I hold the torch. Later that day, I dig into my bag and find the papers she gave me. My aunt recognizes them. She tells me they are the only official document left of my paternal ancestors. They arrived in Mauritius from Bihar, replacing the enslaved on sugarcane plantations after the abolition of slavery. Dadi must have asked a distant relative who works in the National Archives to do her a favour. These are the only written testament of the couple from whom we are all descended. But the enormity of the situation does not correspond to the sparse two pages I hold in my hands. All columns and lists, they look like they were taken from our old grocer’s ledger. As I peer closer, instead of oil, rice, and flour bought on credit, I see the names of coolies borrowed on colonial contract. Next to each name, butchered by French orthography, cold details: registration number, provenance, age, height.

A painful knot forms in my throat when my eyes see before I can understand, ‘Height: 3 feet 2 inches’. When he arrives on the island in 1880, he is six years old. He has a first name only, the same that will become our surname, the same that my secondary school teacher will replace with funny ones during roll call. I look at the other page. She arrives a few years later, the same year tea is introduced in Mauritius. Her name is Somoreeah. She is five, and spends three weeks in a depot before being sent to the Bois Chéri plantation. The sparse documents bring more questions than answers. But they do tell me that she is three feet five inches. She is tall, taller even than him.

Some altars housed statues and images of goddesses, garlanded with flowers. Others held pungent incense and the photographs and personal belongings of dear departed ones. For Durga, we, her teas, held her dear ones, her goddesses.

When her daughter turned five, Durga took her to Mauritius, and to the plantation where Dadi had worked as a métayère, a sharecropper, in the last years of her life. Mama accompanied them but stayed in the car on the side of the road. Her daughter hanging on her shoulders, Durga waded into the waist-high leaves as Mama advised caution on land that they did not own, land she said had only been rented to Dadi. Voices from the colonial house drifted down toward them, muted, but they were quickly drowned out as the leaves tickled the feet of the five-year old and she laughed. Pointing to the tea leaves, she asked: ki ete sa? What is this?

Standing tall over the bushes, Durga breathed in the humid, pungent scent and replied, dite."

    "text": "We were at Fix Bar in the basement dancing to Busta and Ashanti when the message came through that my father was with the police. Romeo was drunk, so was his mother Tracy. Gillian and Romeo had been hugging and pledging their love for one another, ‘Family, we’re family, you’re like my son.’ They were in the house, the police. And father was much confused. And we should come, Gillian and I, yes even though it is two forty in the morning and I am having the time of my life.

My father is ninety-one. He insists on his castle with its empty rooms and baby ghosts. The kitchen bells still ring when he passes through its door. The wallpaper is curled in the familiar places and the garden is fallen. He knows these sunsets well, far out there beyond the dining room window, so much so that he no longer notices them. The whole sun of his life is setting. He is an expanse, a weather movement, an old symphony. Here is his waiting room of preference and who can argue with him? Those of us who have tried to persuade him that passing his last days in a sad communal residential is superior to perilous solipsistic luxury have given up.

So I left that party with my drunken sister Gillian and I am the one driving, being abstinent for my secret foetus. All the way between ‘the crisis is here’ and ‘I need another drink’ it was ‘Romeo the son I never had’ and ‘I need to see more of him’. Tracy is her best friend lately drifted. I used to follow them around when they were turning into women. When Gillian is drunk the seven-year age difference between us wanes and she is simple and unkempt. ‘Please don’t throw up,’ I say when her voice goes creamy and yawny coming off the roundabout, past the bungalow doctor’s surgery of our childhood, past the church we were harangued to enter by motherly shooing on Sundays to learn the tales of Christianity – we used to imagine that the stories were concocted by a bored shepherd dramatising his sheep. How she must be whirling in her grave, our mother, as we are passing by, these two unbelievers, still unbelievers, never yielding for a moment to her faith in paradise. Even now she haunts us. At dusk I hear her whispering, insulted, Where do you think I went?

The northern planes of London are chilly in the rains of April and the car has misted with our cooling body heat. We descend into the final hill and slide to a halt in the drizzle shining the leaves. All the way to the bottom of the street these trees, their branches angled in questions, the answers unfound. The house at first is a ripple. I wait. It always comes at me swimming, then solidifies, the smoke of yesterdays. The lights are on downstairs not upstairs. The porch has the remains of the religiosity of my mother in its stained glass, but beyond that she is gone. Jesus has left this place. The police are here instead, two of them, a woman and a man, standing in the hallway, while our father who art not in heaven is involved in a series of explanations about his panic alarm.

What a sight. His wiry head. His flapping forearms. His crumpled pyjamas. His apple-red mouth. When he sees us his face shows recognition without connection. ‘Ah, hello,’ he says, as if there were no calamity here, no cause for concern, no neighbours have been woken, no one has been interrupted, this is just an everyday middle-of-the-night and an ordinary visit from the crime-fighting public services. ‘Are you alright, Dad?’ Gillian says, a swell of emotion filling her voice. He looks so small, receding into the state of gnome, shrinking before our eyes. ‘Yes, I’m fine,’ he says, his brows raised, looking up and out from his realm of discombobulation with a quiet quivering. ‘You?’

 

First there was forgetting. What is that curved thing called that you use to eat cereals, soup and mousse? And what is the larger thing called that holds them? Information slowed on its journey from sight to brain to mouth. We filled in blanks. There was more and more forgetting, and much of it was invisible, because unless you are with someone all the time you have no way of knowing the new things they have forgotten. Even our mother did not know. Indeed she too forgot. They would wake into days to be remembered for their forgetting. What can you do about this when you are out of the neighbourhood? What are the limits of the grown-up child’s responsibility for the regressing parent? Can we do enough? Can we be enough, from the distance of our selves, and all that we entail?

Both surrounding and following the forgetting were its ramifications. The drawing in of speech. Because my father could not remember the name for spoon, it came to a point when he would not mention spoons, or all the other things he had forgotten that week or month. When he also started forgetting some of the smaller words used to join sentences together, then conversation itself became fatiguing. He had long stopped working by then. So had my mother – she’d taught primary school art and he had worked in taxation. Together they would take the bus to the precinct on Tuesdays and go to Somerfield to buy oranges, Battenberg cake and other things they liked. Gillian had organised mobile phones but they were of little help, they only increased anxiety. Once, I called my father during one such visit to Somerfield and he couldn’t find the phone, it had travelled into a secret alcove in his pocket. The act of speaking into it remained peculiar to him. As far as he was concerned, talking on the telephone should take place in a house, an office, a municipal building, or in a telephone box. Anywhere else was uncivilised and impolite. When he eventually found the phone, he struggled to identify the green button in order to answer it. By the time I received his voice he was a shambles. ‘What? What?’ he shouted. ‘Can you come and change the ringing thing soon, I don’t like it. I have to go to the carrots now!’ and he was gone.

Another time, again before the deeper throes of the forgetting, I took them to a gallery. The sun was on the June road, my father next to me, my mother in the back seat. She had dressed for the occasion in her gold dress, with her black purse, while my father wore his house trousers and carried a Tesco carrier bag. They had never been much the pair, it struck me, but their marriage had been long, and every marriage is a learnt marriage, its own language, its own system, defined only by the two, who they are and what they need and what they can tolerate and what they cannot. They had made something of love, my parents, and only they could have made it, and when they were no longer here it would no longer exist. The tragedy and the functionality of this moved me, as they patiently studied the painting of the dancehall queen in silver shoes seated before a Pre-Raphaelite backdrop, and the short film of the waltzers in the African ball gowns with masks on their faces.

‘That one’s right mysterious,’ my father said. My mother, a late-life Open University student, delving at that time into art criticism, said that she liked the juxtaposition of the diasporic imagery with traditional Eurocentricity.

Afterwards we ate pastries in the cafe by the river. My father fought with his Danish. He was trying to open it neatly but it wouldn’t cooperate.

‘Just tear it open, Dad,’ I exclaimed.

But when a man is in his twilight years and he wants to eat a Danish in his own way, I reflected, trailing towards guilt, you have to just let him. He has earned it. He has earned the right to expect what he expects from the experience of patisserie.

‘That does annoy me,’ he said, ‘how people speak these days. We used to say “expect” instead of “anticipate”. Now everyone says “anticipate”.’

My mother pulled him up on this. ‘Don’t be so backward, Willis.’ Sitting there in gold, watching the room that way she always watched, with a silent relish. Her mind was full of pictures. She painted with her eyes. I believe when she was dying she formed a conduit of colour to take her to her lord and she was ready, at the final moment, to enter light. I will never forget the way her face lost its age. Part of him she took with her. He drew the house around him like a cloak.

Christmases from then on were thin and oblique. We watched TV, missing her. There were random questions, randomly answered.

‘What’s a bling?’ my father said.

‘A bling,’ Gillian said, ‘is something that shines.’

 

The panic alarm is around his neck. He’s supposed to wear it all the time and press it when he falls, needs, severely wants, or glimpses death. This is the most he will allow of caring. Actually he enjoys the little button attached to survival, that he has the power to control his safety. Once a month on the fifteenth Gillian calls him to remind him to test it, which involves pressing it, waiting for the voice from the panic centre to ask if he’s okay, saying yes he’s alright thank you, and saying goodbye. This he also enjoys, in fact Gillian enjoys it too, a common project of memory, a duty. She has always been the one to organise and get things done while I am considered lazier, but it is not true. I aim for the galaxy. I bring stars and dancehall queens. She is of the earth, pragmatic.

‘Well I don’t know,’ my father says for the fourth time. He wriggles his trembling fingers. He is pacing the linoleum with a strange twitch in his waist. He goes from the hallway to the dining room to the kitchen. Whenever someone speaks to him he stares up at them as if they were the final gates opening. His eyes are bling in a moss of age, dazed, dizzy, dwindling, the last of a soul. April is coming wetly through the broken porch windows and the porch floor is soaked. ‘Why don’t you sit down, Dad,’ I say. ‘It’s late. Aren’t you tired?’

‘But what are the police here for?’

‘They just came to check.’

‘Check what?’

‘That you’re okay.’

‘But I didn’t press the button.’

‘We’ll be off now anyway,’ says the policewoman, the cycle of the conversation having been repeated enough times to confirm that they are no longer needed. ‘Sorry about your window. You’ll be alright now, with your dad?’

Gillian has been searching window replacement companies on her phone, suddenly sober. She has an impressive capacity to adopt a veneer of cold yet friendly professionalism at any time of the day and in any mood or physical state; she becomes robotic, and you only notice this if you know her well. She says to the crime-fighters that yes we will be fine now and sees them out. My father watches them go, a look of adoration and profound respect on his face. After a time he finally does sit down in his armchair in the living room, and while I long for slumber (dawn is not far; my silent child usurps) he and Gillian proceed into a full-blown conversation of a meandering nature, touching on disjointed things, comments on a coming storm called Alex, they talk about the washing machine and the limescale in its soap dispenser. She asks if he is hungry, whether he would like a sandwich, cheese, is there any cheese? There is a definition of cheese and a reminder of its taste. He opts instead for biscuits. I place three ginger nuts by his side, find some old newspapers to lay on the wet floor, and then I slip away to go upstairs. Someone in this building has to lie down.

There are three bedrooms. Gillian and I shared a bunk bed until I was tossed into the box room so that her womanhood could spread out. The queen-size that replaced the bunk is still there by the window, the apricot curtains withering above, the once shiny covers in fade. When Gillian and Tracy were smoking Marlboros behind the hot water tank in the garden I used to lie on her bed and sometimes she would come back and find me there, asleep, and I would be woken by the smell of tobacco. I would dream different dreams there, those of another, adaptations. A woman in a red coat would walk towards me out of the bushes, about to tell me something. Tonight, as if no time had passed, she comes again. I have drifted into sleep on the old bed. There is a flicker of my mother on Hampstead Heath with her hair beehive high and the shawl around her shoulders; and my father, like a monster from the deep, a younger man not yet changed. From her strange foliage the woman in her long red coat steps forward, an urgency in her face, fierce with revelation. It’s then that Gillian wakes me, throwing open the door.

‘What are you doing, Gayle?’ she says. ‘Why are you lying down?’

‘I was tired.’

‘I’m tired too. So we should both just go to sleep?’

Her shadow is large and hulking on the wall behind her, a hint of red in it. She swings round and storms back out of the room. I start to get up. She returns and comes close to me. When she speaks again, her voice is unmistakable in its similarity to my father when he was very angry – the hot brief terrifying edge, the power to diminish. ‘Get downstairs and help me deal with this.’ Our history is inside us. I slam the door after her and the dark feathers of the dark past fall.

 

Here is another random question: how do you love a monster when they are no longer monstrous? What do you do with their monstrousness, when it is posed for mercy, when it has turned in on itself? This question kept appearing and remained in my mind whenever I was with the version of my father who had moss for eyes and trembled and fell. He fell in the hall and he fell on the stairs. I would sit with him in the living room, which was slowly emptying, the boxes mounting around us, the utter confusion of his life as it faced its next corner, and I would try to match the two halves of him, the one who was kind and trusting and the one in which a collective of misgivings collided, his tensions and plummets and furious depressions. His weakness, in the end, overpowered his monstrosity.

While my foetus grew – five months, six – we went to visit some residential options. We perused the rooms, square yards and corridors of metropolitan late-life preservation. There was a red-brick nursing home in a former military block in Finchley with marks on the walls and an industrial site backing onto the grounds. A cosy new-age complex not far from the river in Hammersmith, close to Gillian, with outdoor walkways and uniform front doors; the common room had a piano and there was an activity timetable on the noticeboard listing arts and crafts, herb gardening, amateur carpentry and bowling. A tall, calm-inducing woman showed us her hexagonal room with its kitchen-diner and individual patio. My father peered around these possible new corners, imagining himself in this alien kitchen and that little garden, fresh and churning, so different from his familiar wilderness. His expression, through these tours, was of genuine interest bordering on indifference. It was no longer his choice. His children, foremost the eldest, now had the power to decide his future.

‘Are you going to move?’ Gillian asked me.

‘Where to?’

‘If he’s in Hammersmith you could move closer, so we can both be near him.’

‘I thought the whole point was that he’ll be looked after where he lives.’

‘And does that mean we never see him again?’

‘Sometimes you can be so unreasonable,’ I said.

‘Fair. Just fair.’

Something had changed that night after Fix Bar. Some unconditional ease had been dislodged. We were losing each other. Perhaps it was simply the years, our highways parting, the mounting weight of our father between us, but it pained me that Gillian didn’t call as much, even after I told her about the pregnancy. She didn’t send messages at dawn that I would immediately answer if I was awake. This was a loneliness, a new soul growing with no other blood listener, no one outside who knew enough. I told the baby’s father that I missed my sister and he said I’d get her back. How do you know I’ll get her back? I asked, because he was always telling me something would turn out well when he had no grounds on which to base the claim; he had a positive leaning, which I had come to rely on though also ridiculed, leaving me split and dislocated. ‘Because,’ he said, ‘you’re all she’s got. A time comes when you remember that.’

We visited a glossy residential ‘village’ with a large entrance lobby and personal intercoms, woods, a swimming pool, a hairdresser and designer dementia-proof kitchens, which cost two thousand pounds a week. Although I knew that this was beyond the capacity of my father’s wallet – he had saved during his working years for an eventuality like this – I initiated lengthy and foolish discussions with Gillian about its suitability. It was a way of feeling closer to her, bonding us through joint consideration and common urgency. ‘Mum would like it,’ I said. ‘Mum would like the other one better,’ she said. ‘He’d like the woods, though? Imagine him sitting by the window looking out,’ I said. She, ‘It’s too expensive. The Hammersmith one’s best.’

The room they gave him was two doors down from the tall calm-inducing woman. The old house was emptied completely, with Romeo’s help. He found a van, we brought down boxes of textbooks and the camping gear from the attic, gone were the linen trunk, the oboes, the reams of ancient tinsel, the paintings, the extendable dining table and the library of Britannicas and the easel and Mum’s coats which had stayed in her wardrobe hanging with remnants of her outings – a crumbling tissue, a folded piece of paper saying ‘glass cleaner, whisk’. The gold dress went to a charity shop for a six-pound sale. The easel went with my father and lived in a corner, unused, he had no paint, no brushes, but he kept it anyway. It invoked pictures from a history he hardly recognised but wholly contained. When he left the house for the last time in the wings of spring I heard it murmur for its flesh. It watched him go with hollow eyes. It loved its monster, the broken cage of him, walking slowly to the gate.

 

The child had come silver-eyed into the bright. His arms were thick, his skin was hot and papery, he seemed angry. Perhaps all the children looked angry now when they arrived, sensing a treachery in the air, or that too much would be expected of them and too little had been left. Seasons were asunder. There was nervous blossom on winter trees. I intended to tell my child that he was enough in himself, that the world, not him, was wrong. I used to believe that if we all lived as if the world were right it would eventually stand up steady, but on this the child’s father disagreed. It takes more than that, he said, and naivety is dangerous. Me though, I refuse to raise a soldier.

Gillian had taken to spending more time with Romeo. They went to concerts, took walks. I ran into him one day in town by Marble Arch. He carried within him – white Parka, white smile – an insistence on resilience, a learned defence. He was two years from twenty and the shadows might come but he would fend them off. He asked after my father and I said I was going to see him tomorrow. ‘Tell him I said hello. He probably won’t remember me.’ ‘Oh, he remembers everything, in hidden places,’ I said. We hugged goodbye and he walked on towards Park Lane.

The next day was a Sunday. It was the start of November, an autumn gloom lifting towards a Christmas that this year would be homeless. The house had been sold. No more would we gather by the plastic tree and entertain an older time. Those sunsets now were someone else’s. Another family had moved in, their murky insides visible from the street. Their secrets, their private sagas, were taking possession of the rooms. Gillian arrived in a red coat, like the woman from the dream, emerging from the sycamore trees, a cluster of them by the river along the walkway leading to our father’s room. The loneliness was still between us, a familiar estrangement. It occurred to me that I would never have her back the way it was; the child was a new distance. She lifted him and kissed him, balanced him for a while in his grandfather’s crumpled lap. He was talkative that day, a late clarity hovered, but with foreboding.

‘Now then,’ he said. ‘Will you make a picture for mother? She gave me the – brushes. There’s a thing of water.’

The baby looked glazed and gave a misty smile, not quite into the old man’s face but past it, into the recent universe. The easel in the corner had acquired faint, haphazard strokes.

‘Bright as all, you are,’ he said. ‘You look like angels.’

We were not sure who the angels were, but his eyes were darker, the moss thickened. He told us he was going to take his bike into the fields in the morning and find the house where she lived, it had a red front door. They would eat plum cake. The pears were not ripe yet.

‘Who’s that you’re talking about, Dad?’ Gillian said.

‘Well,’ he said, ‘it’s Anna. You remember Anna.’

And he told us, his last audience, about the woman in the house with the red door and her pear tree in the back where the sunsets fell. His memories now were one world, meshed and exploded. We were colliding with one another across his great pictures. He looked small and alien in this clean new space. You take a root from its ground and plant it somewhere else, it doesn’t grow, if too much time has already passed, if the essence has reached too deep. He did not know how to navigate this place, with its piano and its tall neighbour who knocked on his door asking if he wanted to come to church, or to harvest chives.

‘He’s going to die,’ I said, back out by the trees, the river behind us.

‘Yes,’ Gillian said.

‘Each time he knows us less. And one day when he’s gone we’ll be the only ones.’

‘We’ll be free.’

Dusk was gathering around, calling its blue birds, making the river shift. Gillian trembled inside her coat and held on to me. We were children at sea in the bodies of women. We were standing at the beginning again, where anything could be revealed and probed and admitted.

‘I always felt like I should be someone else,’ she said, ‘someone better. He made me feel like that. I thought I’d done something wrong.’

‘You didn’t do anything,’ I said.

‘Neither did you.’

 

I saw my father dance once. Only once. It was at Gillian’s wedding. There was a great tune, the kind of tune that makes the old and the young rise up. My mother was dancing. Her headwrap made shapes against the lights. She was joyous, unleashed. My father got up and inched forward towards the floor. He started moving, stiffly clapping. He couldn’t dance for hell. He had no concept of beat, no swing, no rhythm or sense of time. It was like a wooden thing moving after a lifetime of restraint. But it was the fact of this dancing that I will never forget, which captured, for all to see, a dimension of him, a presence we had never known, which had never made its way to us, had been held from us all the time, unwitnessed.

    "text": "I’ve always believed that the only constant in life is change. If we don’t embrace change, we fail to grow. Even worse, we put ourselves at risk. We lose the capacity to change when change is forced upon us. I resolved long ago I’d never again be afraid of change. And that is why I am here today.

That was my opening statement. It was what I believed then and it’s what I believe now. Perhaps even more so. I sat back down in the sharing circle to the sound of clicking fingers, a sound others might call snapping.

Thank you, said Hanno, our facilitator. That was so brave.

Yes, said the man beside me, so brave. He leaned over and whispered in my ear. Can I ask you something? Can I ask for your consent to touch you on the knee? I just want to express, physically, how much I admire what you said.

I said no, but politely. I don’t generally enjoy being touched by strangers, and while this was also something I wanted to change, I’ve learned to be kind to myself and not to push myself too hard in situations that make me uncomfortable.

When the final round of clicking and/or snapping died down, Hanno walked into the centre of the sharing circle.

With these incredible acts of vulnerability the first part of our opening ceremony has come to an end. Now, in order to embrace the community that has gathered here today, I am going to ask you to form what we call family groups. These will be groups of people who come together because they are arriving here with particularly important shared experiences. Your family group will be a space to which you can return for safe reflection, at any time, over the course of our journey together. So now, please stand up and begin to move through the room, connecting with those you see around you.

I am not a very sociable person. I have a small number of close friends who provide me with the emotional support I need. With them I am extremely affectionate and relaxed. They have often called me things like playful, silly, or boyish. I rarely work well in social situations with people I don’t know.

I stood up and looked around the room, a converted barn, the walls painted white. I counted maybe forty people drifting across the wooden floor, forming small groups and clusters.

Eventually Hanno approached me. Ben, he said, glancing at the name badge I was wearing, my role as facilitator is to enable you to get the most out of your time here. So I was wondering whether you might be open to forming a family group with some beautiful people I have just met: Omar and Kemal. I think you three might have a lot in common. 

These people seemed nice and I quickly agreed we could form a family group so I could return to my room for a rest. What I call my social battery gets very depleted by talking to strangers. The on-site accommodation was located in a renovated farmhouse close to the barn, a communal dorm with rows of bunk beds, but I had chosen to stay in my own room in a guest house a short walk up the road. I always like to sleep alone, in darkness and in silence. I like to have a space where I can go to recharge. The first day had come to an end and I wanted to be prepared for what I had decided lay ahead of me.

 

I’d recently witnessed a lot of change happening around me. I’d observed one of my best friends ruin a relationship because he became unable to communicate with his partner. He started lying about what he wanted, and ultimately ended up lying to himself. If we lie to ourselves, we risk forgetting who we are, and someone who doesn’t know who they are is a dangerous person. I never want to be a dangerous person.

Around the same time, my friend Sam was diagnosed with cancer. At the age of thirty-five. My other friend Anna had decided to freeze her eggs, only to discover that none of them were viable. In fact, according to her doctor, her chances of conceiving naturally, or even via IVF, are now negligible to impossible. Other changes were more positive. Kasia, a friend who has inspired and challenged me like no one before, finally qualified for permanent residency and can now stay in London for good. All this reminded me of what I already knew: life is constant change.

I know exactly what you need, Kasia said to me when I told her that I was ready for a new era. When I was living in Berlin, many of my gay friends would go to this festival, a weekend of talks, workshops, exercises. It would transform them, transform their entire lives. You have to do it. I can get you tickets, I know the organisers, I’m buying you the flights, it’s done!

It can be difficult to embrace change. But I believe the alternative is much worse. If we don’t accept change, we deceive ourselves by pretending that things can stay the same. And when we deceive ourselves, we also deceive other people. This leads to deception in relationships and friendships and if we are not careful, this deception can lead to abuse. To violence. People pretend to be something that they are not and when this lie is discovered, they lash out. I have observed so many abusive dynamics within relationships in my life. How many people are killed in relationships? A woman is killed by her partner or a member of her family every ten minutes. I understand this is due to patriarchal dominance rather than the inherent nature of human relationships. However, this is the world in which we have all been raised. I resolved years ago to break the cycle of abuse, and only enter into relationships where I felt that clear, verbal communication was possible in order to settle any conflicts that might arise.

If this meant that in the past I didn’t enter into romantic relationships because many, many people are incapable of clear, verbal communication – of simply replying to a text message, even when sent multiple times – this has never been a permanent decision on my part. I know there are other ways in which people communicate. I’ve read a lot of books, I’ve spent a lot of nights watching videos online, I’ve bookmarked a lot of pages on my internet browser. I know other forms of communication exist – touch, movement, even the hormones we secrete when we orgasm – it’s just that I’ve not yet been able to understand them. This might be because I only had a limited opportunity to learn other communication styles from my family, but after much reflection I concluded this isn’t likely to be the case. I have a very good memory and I cannot recall a time when I didn’t need clear, verbal communication. This is why, as a child, I never wanted a pet.

However, observing my friends navigate their recent difficulties did give me an idea. While I might not be able to change who I am, I might be able to change what I do. I might be able to understand other communication styles if I can translate them into the language I do understand: words. As someone who works as an audio engineer, translating sound waves in the air into electronic frequencies and back again, I realised this might be a technical problem I could solve, like dubbing a foreign film into English. I just needed the opportunity to actualise my will to change.

It is a festival, said Kasia, for anyone, how did she phrase it, for anyone in or attracted to the space of masculinity within a fluid gender spectrum. You go for a weekend and you stay in this farmhouse outside the city and you attend talks, workshops, healings. And you know, Ben, she said, I’ve always thought you would benefit from something like this. It’s going to be so good for you.

I believe that many gay men are sick. I believe that many gay men are deeply, deeply sick. This is because we are brought up in a society which is itself sick. The vast majority of gay men are raised in families where at least at first they are taught to be ashamed of who they are. I would call this a situation of emotional abuse. Many gay men have been taught to hate themselves. I don’t believe this ever really goes away. People may get to the point where they no longer consciously hate themselves, they may look in the mirror and think they love and accept what they see, but where does that hatred go? It is taken out on others in the form of toxic behaviour and emotional abuse.

When I lived for a number of years in Singapore, working for an English-language television station, the only friends I had were a group of gay men who would come to the country twice a year. Once in winter, once in summer. They would spend a month visiting cities in the Asia-Pacific region: Sydney, Honolulu, Hong Kong, Bangkok. It is a lie that you cannot be openly gay in Singapore. It is in fact completely legal. However, I experienced a strong division between those who had been born and raised in Singapore, and those who were expats, like me. These men would come to Singapore for a week at a time, they would stay in their hotels or hotel compounds, they would work out in the gym all day, and they would organise sex parties in their hotel rooms at night. No one would have sex with me, so I didn’t go. Perhaps it was because I was too small, perhaps it was because I was too brown, perhaps it was because I was too hairy. I have very hairy shoulders, so I rarely wear vests. Some men, I have seen this, they shave their shoulders every week. One night, when we had finished drinking vodka tonics at a hotel bar, one of them, Jamie, asked me if I wanted to come to their hotel room and take some drugs. I said no. That’s a shame, Jamie said. You have a great face, Ben; if only you worked out a bit more maybe you could be one of us.

Men like this, they are sick. They are damaged. They are everywhere, and they are dangerous. In any relationship, I need to feel safe. Men like this do not make me feel safe. They are why my most important relationships are my friendships. However, I’ve realised that in allowing men like this to hurt me, because I am not able to prevent observations like this from hurting me, I had unconsciously allowed myself to live in fear. And to living in fear, I say: no.

My flight arrived at the airport at six o’clock on Friday evening and I took a train to the village, which was located about an hour outside of Berlin. Most people were staying in the communal dorms, but there were also some men checking into my guest house. Or what they call in Germany a Pension. I like to plan situations in advance, to know what I am doing each day. On the train I had looked at the programme and selected the workshops I would attend. Since I’m not currently, and have never been, in a romantic relationship, I didn’t think I needed to practise intimacy’s choreography of gifts and requests. As someone who doesn’t have a family, I didn’t think it would be productive for me to go on a journey through my family constellation. I cannot ever see myself wanting to engage in plushie play. I also didn’t think I needed to learn how to dare to demand. I am someone who is already very confident about verbally expressing what I think. I always tell people the truth. This is why many people think I cause conflict, when in reality they just cannot handle the truth.

I am someone who is very picky about being touched. I hate, I absolutely hate being touched without my consent. Even when consent has been explicitly articulated on both sides I enjoy touching someone else – particularly their back and shoulders – much more than I enjoy being touched. If I have to, I prefer to penetrate other men rather than get penetrated myself. Just because I am someone who prioritises friendships over relationships, and who gets his main emotional needs fulfilled by those friendships, doesn’t mean that I don’t have sex. I have plenty of sex. Often, however, I find it unsatisfying.

Over the years I’ve experimented with many types of men, and I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m only attracted to conventionally attractive men who are tall. Taller than me. I understand I’ve been conditioned to feel this way but so far this is something I’ve not been able to change. Conventionally attractive men who are tall only want to have sex with conventionally attractive men who are also tall, or at least the same height, because someone cannot always be taller. If the tall always sought the taller, where would it end?

I am not conventionally attractive and I am not tall so when I message men looking for sex, or approach men in nightclubs, most of the time they reject me. When I’m not rejected, or when I’m accepted by someone who is tall but a little bit chubby, which is something I like, and who therefore will settle for someone who is short, like me, I enjoy sucking dick and rimming and licking men’s armpits as much as anyone else. I just don’t enjoy being penetrated. But many men underneath their conventionally attractive tall shells are just that: tall shells. They are empty inside. After sex they will rarely want to meet me again. Every time this happens, I ask them direct questions. I ask them: Why didn’t you reply to my message? Why don’t you want to see me again? What did I do that makes you not want to see me again? They rarely if ever reply.

This is something about myself that I wanted to change. I wanted to be attracted to different kinds of men. I wanted to embrace change. So I decided to sign up for the naked durational massage event, where apparently I would learn the pleasure of receiving as well as giving sensual touch. I showed up to a small room in the farmhouse wearing only a towel, as requested. There were maybe twenty men inside. The only windows were skylights in the slanting roof. There was incense burning and soft, chanted music playing from a Bluetooth speaker.

The instructor, Florian, reminded us that while this was a session intended to stretch the boundaries of what we would normally tolerate, if at any time we felt unsafe all we had to do was raise a hand in the air.

However, emphasised Florian, feeling unsafe is not the same as just feeling uncomfortable.

After dedicating a blessing to the space, we were told to drop our towels when we felt ready. I felt ready. I dropped my towel.

We were asked to begin moving around the room and when we felt the energy was right, to reach out and touch other people. For a while I stood in the corner of the room, waiting to feel the right energy inside me. Two black men were already stroking one another and a white man came up and touched their shoulders. I noticed that, even though he was tall and was smiling, no one was reaching out to touch the one visibly trans guy in the room. An older bald man reached out and touched my testicles but the energy didn’t feel right so I started to circulate around the room. I circulated again and again but then the older bald man appeared in front of me again and for some reason something about this room didn’t feel safe. I could see there were people in this room who also didn’t feel safe so I raised my hand and picked up my towel and left.

On the way back to my room, still wearing only my towel, I passed two members of my family group, Omar and Kemal.

I’m sorry about Hanno, said Omar.

Why? I asked, and both of them laughed, as if I were making a joke. They smiled at me and Omar put his hand around Kemal’s shoulders.

Your towel looks nice, said Kemal. We are just going to practise massages in our dorm, do you want to join us?

I explained directly and politely that I don’t enjoy massages and went back to my room. I remember feeling frustrated, and confused.

That afternoon, however, I had a very different kind of experience.

The workshop was called Sitting in Silence. This session, according to my brochure, would explore what happens when we connect through the simple act of looking. Participants were to gather in a room and stare into a stranger’s eyes for an hour, without speaking, paying attention to the thoughts and feelings that arise in this period of silent intimacy. When the hour came to an end, we were to return to our rooms, or one of the designated quiet spaces, and write down our thoughts as part of our reflective journaling practice, or simply to engage in whatever type of processing felt right in that moment.

The workshop, led by Hanno, took place in the converted barn with white walls, filled that afternoon with a soft, golden light. As I removed my shoes, placing them side by side against the wall, I observed that there were maybe thirty men in the room, everyone staring at the floor.

As we open this session, said Hanno, I encourage you to move through this space and attune yourself to the energy you sense around you. I will shortly ask you to stop moving, to close your eyes, and then to gently turn around on the spot. Then I will sound my gong, and the exercise will begin.

This time I was determined to follow the rules. I closed my eyes. I could sense other people around me. Due to my sensitivity about being touched, I have a strong sense of kinaesthetic awareness. I can feel when people are about to enter my personal space, and I could sense people turning around as I too turned around in the dark.

I heard the gong. I opened my eyes. I instantly made eye contact with someone who held my gaze in turn. His eyes were a deep brown, almost black. His skin was also brown, the colour of honey. He had a moustache, and short, curly black hair. He smiled at me before I smiled at him. He was exactly the same height as me. I remember feeling an impulse to look away. To look up, down, to the side. But I didn’t. I realise how strange this sounds, but already I felt I had committed to something that, if I saw it through, would change my life.

I walked towards him, carefully avoiding the other men who, in my peripheral vision, were drifting slowly across the room. I kept feeling an urge to look at his body, just for a few seconds. To double-check how tall he was, to be certain we were the same height. I could see that he was wearing a white vest and black denim shorts. He seemed to be lean, not muscular, but lean. I decided he was older than me, but only slightly. As we approached one another and sat down, without ever breaking eye contact, I realised that we were exactly the same height and that this would be a relationship between equals. A relationship where, right from the beginning, there could be no imbalance of power.

I sat down cross-legged on the floor and he sat down in front of me, barely an arm’s length away. I felt a rush of blood colour my neck. Then, suddenly, I started to get an erection. I panicked a little bit and the feeling of nerves only made me even more aroused. I could feel my erection pressing against my shorts but I couldn’t look down to see whether it was visible. I remember thinking: I have an average-sized dick. Sometimes men tell me, Wow, your dick is so huge, it’s so big, and I feel sorry for them. They need to imagine they are having sex with someone with a huge dick in order to feel turned on. That they are so hot that someone with a huge dick would fuck them. My average-sized dick was pressing against my shorts but I realised he had been staring into my eyes the whole time. He hadn’t been looking at my dick. That for some reason made me even more turned on and my dick even harder.

Even though I was staring into his eyes, I couldn’t help it: I was imagining what his dick looked like. His skin was brown. He could have been Spanish, Moroccan, Lebanese, from anywhere in the Mediterranean or Arab world. He looked generically Middle Eastern. I needed to know where he was from because it would tell me what his dick would look like, whether he was circumcised or not. I wondered what he thought my dick looked like. He probably thought I was circumcised, even though I wasn’t. This is a common misconception I have had to deal with. My mother was white, but I look fairly brown, which must have come from my father. This has always been a source of confusion to people, when they try to place me, as I assumed this person was doing now. I felt my erection shrivelling a little bit because suddenly I wondered what he was thinking about me.

My mother told me very little about my father, because, as she explained when I was eight, there is very little to tell. She met him when she was living in Sheffield, when he was working in a foundry for six months as an engineer. Making gun barrels. She got pregnant, and soon after he had to return home to Iraq. She wrote him a letter but never heard back. Then she moved to Coventry and had me, her one and only.

People assume that because I am brown, because I look like an Arab, that I must be a Muslim. Or, in the case of white gay men, that I am circumcised and going to be an aggressive, violent top. While, as I have said, if I do have to engage in penetrative sex, I would rather penetrate than be penetrated, I am a very gentle person. I don’t like being the object of someone else’s fantasy. This happens especially frequently when I date men while travelling in the whiter parts of Europe. Denmark, Norway, Sweden. Even France.

I noticed he was still smiling at me and that, as he smiled, the muscles around his eyes relaxed and his cheeks rose slightly. My erection was now very hard. His eyes were telling me he was happy, that he was comfortable. I decided there was a high probability he worked in some kind of creative but caring profession. A dance teacher. He had a dancer’s body. I decided he had come to this event to embrace change, and to expand his capacity for understanding people who have different communication styles than his own. People who are direct and always tell the truth.

Light from a candle was flickering in his pupils. I began to zone out and lose track of time to a certain extent. There are parts of this experience I cannot remember because there was no alteration to my field of perception for almost a whole hour, and I’ve read that our memories are anchored to changes in our spatial environment. If we spend extensive amounts of time in the same space, like our childhood bedrooms, all that time collapses into a single memory.

I realise in recounting this that what I am now going to say will sound absurd but I owe an explanation of my feelings to no one. No one else has the authority to decide whether what I feel is valid or not. Even though he had told me nothing, verbally, the fact that he hadn’t looked away for all this time meant he must have been open to the possibility of falling in love with me. I can’t tell you how I knew this, but I knew it. Love is a concept about which I have long been very sceptical. I have seen the damage that can be done, and can be justified, in the name of love. My mother, for example, must have been in love with my father, even just for one night, or otherwise she would have had an abortion.

Once I realised he was open to the possibility of falling in love with me, I felt open to the possibility of falling in love with him. I remember the moment specifically because I smiled with my eyes and then – I panicked. And not in the way that made me feel aroused. I panicked because I suddenly thought: I know nothing about him and yet here I am with the intense feeling that I’m falling in love. We have just been sitting here in silence. What if we were to enter into a romantic relationship – would he be capable of clear, verbal communication?

When I go out to gay clubs, I sometimes get approached by couples wanting to have a threesome with me. If I have taken a lot of drugs, I might say yes. But mostly, I say no. Because when I would have sex with these couples, they would completely ignore one another and give all their attention to me. Fuck me, let me suck you, and so on. I found this objectifying, and borderline abusive. Once I got over this feeling of being used, and most likely stereotyped, I realised there was something else going on. These couples: they were not communicating, not clearly and verbally. What couples ever do? Does anyone really know what the person they love thinks about them? Who would want to hear that truth?

So I decided to conduct an experiment. Rather than wait for couples to approach me, I started to approach them. I would go up to a couple and ask, Hey, I hope I am not intruding, do I have your consent to ask a question? Once consent had been granted I would ask: Would you be open to the possibility of a threesome with me? The results were revealing. Every time the couple had to look at one another before answering. Every time! Neither knew what the other was going to say. They didn’t know because they hadn’t been communicating. From this experiment I concluded that the vast, vast majority of men in relationships do not communicate openly about their desires.

I had been sitting down so long my foot began to cramp. Then I observed a confused look in his eyes. He had noticed something. My discomfort. My panic. What kind of person was he? Could he help me build a brighter future or was he crippled by the sickness of the world as it is? Before I told my mother I was gay, I took a deep breath and braced myself for change. Even though I had workshopped various scenarios, I had no idea what was coming. When she didn’t immediately respond I realised it was scenario three, so I told her I could move out the next day, I had saved up money, and I could work for a year before going to university. Which is what I did. I saw online that I now have a sister. But by the time I found this out, I had something better than a family of my own: my friends.

For in a friendship, unlike in a family, no one sticks with you out of some unspoken obligation. Likewise, in romantic relationships, people might not be attracted to you, as a unique individual, they might be driven by unspeakable needs, originating deep in their childhood, needs they could never explain to you because they can’t even explain them to themselves. Whereas in friendships, you are making a choice to get close to someone and they are making a choice to get close to you, a conscious choice that can always be discussed clearly and verbally. This is why friendships have been the only relationships in which I’ve felt safe, where I’ve been certain the other person is not lying to me.

The only relationships: up until this point. I was now really starting to panic. Was he deceiving me, right now, looking at my eyes but thinking, when will this be over, when can I just get up and leave? My legs tensed, and, yes, for a second I began to stand up. I felt the blood rush into my cramped feet, I thought about what Hanno would say, that I was breaking the rules, that I hadn’t stuck it out. And then I heard him begin to take a deep breath. Without once breaking eye contact, he slowly inhaled and sat up tall, stretching out his spine, pulling back his shoulders, and then he leaned forward and calmly continued to stare at me straight in the eyes. As he exhaled I felt my panic melt away. And then I knew. I was certain. He was different, unlike anyone I had ever met before. I just knew.

My panic had turned into reassurance. In fact, my panic had enabled reassurance. It had functioned like a test. I had momentarily wanted to run away, maybe in my mind I had run away, but when I had returned this person was still here. I felt the possibility of romantic love open up before me. He had somehow sensed my needs. I was able to smell him now, to distinguish his smell from that of the incense that was wafting through the room. He smelled like tobacco. He also smelled like coconut, and slightly sour, in a good way.

This is what I remember. I remember taking a deep breath and trying to assess the proportion of tobacco versus coconut in his scent. I remember hearing the gong. We stood up at the same time and I remember we were still looking into one another’s eyes. I understood that we had to leave and that I needed to begin the practice of reflective journaling that would lead to this revelation, the one I am able to share, in part, now. The relationship I had created had to come to an end, but I didn’t feel panic or anxiety. I smiled at him and he smiled at me. We turned around at the exact same time, and then I walked out the door and back to my room in the Pension.

 

The next day was the closing ceremony. I knew he would be there. I got to the room early so I could see everyone as they arrived. I saw Omar and Kemal stroll in and I had an impulse to smile at them. To non-verbally express some empathy and, yes, a sense of solidarity. But when I tried to catch their eyes they ignored me and sat down beside a group of tall white men. I flushed with blood and wanted to walk over and ask them, directly, why they had ignored me, but then Hanno asked us to sit down in a circle.

Or what I call, said Hanno, an inverse circle. I want us to be in proximity but also to be able to give each other the freedom to say things that others might at first find difficult to hear. So as you arrive, I ask you to sit down on the floor, cross-legged in a seating pose, or in whatever kind of seated position that feels comfortable in this present moment, and to form a circle facing outwards. Become aware of what this arrangement makes you feel. What is coming up for you right now?

Hanno non-coercively directed me to sit down and face the wall and because I was early I was one of the first to form the circle.
I heard more people arriving. I couldn’t see them but I knew there was no reason to panic. He would hear me.

Hanno invited us to begin the sharing. Normally I would have felt the need to verbalise my feelings right away but already I was learning: this is not something I always have to do.

I have something I would like to say, someone said. I would just like to express my gratitude to you all for coming here. We have all been so brave and I feel honoured to have experienced such intimacy with you all.

I would like to say something, said someone else. This is not an attack on anyone in particular, but I did feel that our discussions at times lacked a more materialist analysis of the oppression that we face but are also complicit in inflicting.

I saw Hanno glide past me while everyone sat in silence.

I have something complex to say, said another voice, and I am not sure how to say it, but I have never doubted anyone’s good faith this weekend so I will just try my best. I would never want to police anyone else’s desires, and I also understand that no one is entitled to be desired by anyone else. But I will say, especially in the durational massage event, I was made very aware that I was not attractive to anyone here. And I suppose I want to say nothing more than this made me feel sad.

It was finally my moment.

I have something to share, I said. I came to this weekend with the intention to embrace change. To push my boundaries. To maybe dissolve them, in a safe way. I believe that only if we are open to change are we able to survive. To thrive. I am someone who is very skilled at clear, verbal communication. In turn, I need clear, verbal communication from other people because if this isn’t available, there is a threat of misunderstanding. Misunderstanding which can lead to conflict, conflict which can lead to abuse. To violence. I have always known there are other communication styles, but I have never been able to understand them. This has caused me deep anxiety and frustration. But this weekend I realised I no longer have to be anxious, or to punish myself, because I discovered that I can translate other modes of communication into my preferred form. I can observe non-verbal cues like looks, blushes, postures, and so on, and silently, to myself, I can translate them into a verbal equivalent. I can then check in with other people and ask them questions. What do you mean? Is this what you mean? By doing this I can create a feedback loop of non-verbal and verbal communication and this can expand and transform my ability to understand and connect with people.

The circle remained silent, but this didn’t upset me.

Thank you, said Hanno, that was very passionately said.

Wait, I said, there’s more. I have learned that love needs silence, but silence is not deception. What I’ve also realised is that the silence that enables love – this is more powerful than the ideology of romance, which is only one kind of love. I believe we don’t know even a fraction of what love could be if we brought a comparable level of sensitivity and awareness to non-verbal communication within friendships. I feel like I have this new power and while I may use it to open the door for romance, I am certain I can use it to help my friends. This is my mission.

When we had completed our blessing I stood up and turned around. I couldn’t see him. He wasn’t there. It didn’t matter. This is what this person had come into my life to do. To give me this revelation. Sometimes, what I learn from observing people overwhelms me. I have to be very, very careful about revealing what I now know to other people, in case they use it against me. I cannot reveal everything I have learned, the danger would be too great. Just because I have changed, this doesn’t mean the world has changed. The world is still sick. The world is still full of danger. But I’ve changed. I have completely changed."

    "text": "It was dark by the time I reached Bonn. I was about to meet, thirty years later, Selma, who had been my best friend when I was young. Our friendship had unravelled as friendships often do, for no particular reason, because our paths had diverged. I had started to write, Selma had fallen in love with a German musician, and although our tastes and interests had been, if not shared, at least very similar between the ages of seventeen and twenty-two, she had turned more and more towards her own interests, which were music, mysticism and philosophy, while I had turned more and more towards mine, which was literature. The parting, however, had been a bit brusque, and it was Selma who had initiated it. We met in a cafe in Paris where she told me she had decided to end our friendship and go her own way. I then forgot about her, I think, as no doubt she forgot about me, though I discovered later, when I met up with her again, that she had felt bad about ending our friendship in this rather brutal manner and feared I might have been badly hurt.

I remembered Selma as a girl who, when she turned up for vacation at my grandparents’ one day, had stepped down from the train with an enormous bunch of wildflowers. I also remembered the pleasure she took in tormenting a shy young man who was in love with her, playing at kissing him whenever possible only to give him nothing in the end. On another occasion, when she was the one in love, she had declared her passion for a man she yearned for but didn’t know how to approach by stuffing his mailbox with rose petals. I remembered that she read Nietzsche avidly, that her father was a minister, and that she had an absolutism that made my own demands seemed lukewarm. Last but not least, I remembered an abundant correspondence the moment we were apart, and endless conversations the moment we were together. Something slightly odd united us at times: a form of cruelty.

One day, scrolling through Google for traces of this or that friend from the past, I typed her name on the keyboard and discovered that she lived in Bonn, where she sold icons. There was an email address, I wrote to it, cautiously, asking if she was indeed the Selma I had known, though as her surname was very unusual, I was almost certain it was her. She replied at once, and a frantic exchange of long emails ensued, giving news of our lives, clearing up misunderstandings, sharing bereavements (in my case), births (in hers), affairs of the heart, jobs. And we decided to meet. It was I who would take the first step and go to Bonn, since it was I who had wanted to find her.

When I stepped down from the train, Selma was waiting for me on the platform with an enormous bouquet, not of wildflowers this time, but of roses. What struck me at once was that she hadn’t changed at all. Thirty years of life, of new experiences, joys and sorrows, friendships and loves, travels and work, and, in Selma’s case, motherhood, had left her so identical to the young woman I had known that I felt almost uncomfortable. She wanted to whisk me off to a beach on the shores of the Rhine where she liked to sit and watch the river. I thought it very sweet of her to want to involve me like this, right away, in something she enjoyed doing, but I was worn-out from the journey and from the emotions aroused by the idea of a reunion, it was dark out, I would have preferred her to take me to her apartment where I would have rested for a while before dinner. I told myself that I had clearly aged, with this need to pace myself and rest, whereas Selma, like the woman she had been, the women we had both been thirty years earlier, cared nothing for rest or quiet. She had remained every bit as ardent, lively, inventive and freewheeling as before. I admired her for this, realizing (though I had known it for years) that I no longer felt any pleasure in improvising, sitting on a beach at night when it’s a bit chilly, drinking beer straight from the bottle, chatting with a friend under the stars.

Not only had Selma not changed physically, with her scarlet lipstick, her leather trench coat and her blonde hair, but her attitude to life hadn’t changed either, her words, her conversation, her laughter. And yet she had a twenty-five-year-old daughter whom she had raised alone, and she’d had a rather hard life which she told me a bit about, as well as certain satisfactions I found difficult to place. When she showed me into her home I was at once amazed, intrigued and bewildered. The apartment, where she lived by herself, was gigantic, occupying two floors with a huge terrace, was full of interesting furniture and objects, some of which came from her family (I recognized a sleigh bed I had seen at her parents’ home) while others she had probably bought for herself (I recognized her unfailing good taste), was packed with bookcases and books, vases filled with fresh or wilting roses . . . and was an unspeakable mess. On a table, on a beautiful tablecloth spattered with stains, unwashed plates and overturned wineglasses conjured up the aftermath of a drunken party, except that the glasses, plates and tablecloth seemed to have been there not for twelve or twenty-four hours, but for weeks. In her kitchen, a mound of dishes, saucepans, glasses, plates and cutlery spilled out over the sink and neigbouring surfaces, like in a fairy tale where time has come to a halt and turned everything to stone, leaving everything ‘exactly as it is’ in a magical sleep. Selma seemed oblivious to the mess and offered not a word of explanation. I realized that this was her world, that she had been inhabiting this world for a long time now and couldn’t see how odd it appeared to a visitor, and that she probably welcomed very few visitors into her home.

Other than this, there was nothing to suggest a woman who had lost her way. She dealt with some business on the phone, switching fluently between German and English, showed me pictures of her daughter, who was studying abroad, pulled down books we had read together when young and took me out to dinner at a restaurant she liked. What struck me when we were back in the apartment was the hoard of possessions she seemed to live among, a side of her I had never seen before: ten coats hung on her coat rack, on one of the large tables in the living room were bundles of folders and documents, her terrace was overflowing with plants, and her bathroom, which I visited briefly before turning in for the night in a bedroom of my choice (there were four available), must have contained a good fifty flasks, jars, shampoos, creams, oils, soaps. Selma lives as if there were eight or ten of her, I said to myself. And though the hoard of possessions and the chaos to be found nearly everywhere seemed extraordinary to me, I still wanted to see in them a fearless display of freedom, of disregard for practical affairs, of youthfulness, mentally comparing her life  to my own, which had become so strictly regulated, so orderly and so full of little habits, that it made my friends laugh.

There was also the question of a man. A wealthy, powerful man whom Selma was toying with, exactly as she had toyed with the timid young man until he was madly in love with her and then instantly cast him aside. The persistence of this over the years struck me as odd. Had Selma never felt the need for love and affection, like me, like the rest of the world? Was she trapped in this sadistic wheel, or did she remain there because it was the only position that gave her pleasure? What had grown in her, it seemed to me, was not what I had most liked about her in the past. She also had this way of disavowing, of erasing the thirty years that had elapsed by dredging up conversations that no longer held any real meaning for me, discussions and questions which, for my part, I had found an answer to one way or another over the years, and I didn’t like the confusion this sowed in my mind. Little by little, I could feel myself growing apart from her again. I was there for three days, but by the second day I was itching to leave. I still admired the independence of mind that had always distinguished her, her way of thinking solely for herself which I had loved more than anything and which had made us such close friends, the peals of laughter with which she would greet any form of stupidity, vulgarity, falsehood. Yet the gap which had started to appear, as if between the two legs of a pair of compasses, when we were twenty-two had grown significantly in my eyes, and now stood so wide open that, apart from our momentous meeting at seventeen, we had virtually nothing in common.

After my return to Paris, she wanted to continue our discussions, but I didn’t, and I told her so, explaining why. As gently as I could, I closed the door. She never tried to open it again. Later, I wondered whether her decision to end our friendship when we were twenty-two hadn’t affected me more than I realized, and whether the reason I went back to see her, thirty years later, was so I could end it in my turn."

    "text": "The sad thing? His parents, in their own way, had encouraged his talent. His father had typed and printed out his limericks when he was young, stowing these relics away in a Godrej to bring out for guests to ‘ooh’ and ‘aah’ over. Years later, his economist mother had taken Chetan along on a work trip to the US and arranged a meeting with a shambolic English professor in Chicago. Chetan had applied to that college for his undergraduate degree and been admitted.

His parents had not wished for their son to pursue art as a career, but they had lit his path.

He had betrayed them.

Now, thanks to what Chetan had published, he and his parents were in trouble, and he was exiled from India. The exile was only mental: realistically, Chetan could take a plane home anytime. This was the difference between a previous generation’s experience abroad and his. In the 1980s – that period when his parents had briefly lived in Texas – you could be in love with your home country, besotted with your grandparents, nieces, and nephews – writing them letters every week – but you could only speak to them on the phone a couple of times a year. A trip, if it came, was momentous, an event long saved-for, built-toward. Whereas now, you could hate everyone at home, quarrel with them over email, be alienated and disowned, and still return three times a year.

A month after the fallout from his book, Chetan found himself on a flight to Mumbai. He was frightened.

At the airport, his parents received him with grave hugs, and later he lunched with them at a plastic table in their bedroom, so placed that you could watch cricket on the rackety TV as you ate. ‘So what?’ his father was asking, between tocks of a two-dimensional cricket ball. ‘What’s happened has happened. You must come and promote your book. Have you contacted your publisher here about an event?’

Chetan said he would do it.

‘Beta, don’t just keep looking into it,’ his father said.

His generous father! Chetan watched the graying man fork salad – cucumbers and carrots – onto his plate. His father was on a diet, as always, but it would be undone, Chetan knew, in the afternoon when he became ravenous and consumed biscuits and fistfuls of salted almonds, and then started casually insisting that the maid mix bhelpuri ‘for his son’.

Chetan’s mother was more circumspect. She asked Chetan about his flight, dragging a small comet of daal in a clockwise circle on her plate.

Chetan, half asleep from jetlag, foggily glanced out the barred window. Nothing had changed in this mildewed Bombay Deco tower full of his relatives. The driveway was still a long bat of stale, dried-up Cadbury’s from which great bites had been taken out. The tree outside the bedroom window spat its leaves in all directions, so you could barely glimpse the tinselly cars crammed underneath. The jaalid white wall along the driveway – the wall that he and his sister had delighted in kicking in as kids, watching the delicate fretwork crumble – had, like all the other common areas, never been repaired.

And over the next few days, meeting relatives, it was possible to feel that nothing had changed in the family either.

‘You write in such high English, beta, I could barely understand it,’ one of his chachis said, when he went to see her in her drawing room, a space she constantly reconfigured as an expression of her larger dissatisfactions. ‘But Chacha and I are very proud.’

An older cousin he met said she wanted Chetan to sign her book.

This was not the shouting or abuse he had expected. The explosions had happened in his absence – to his parents.

And, one night, when his mother sat with him on his bed – her appearance in his room always a harbinger of bad news – he learned that things had been worse than she’d let on over the phone.

At a family wedding, she said, she and Chetan’s father had been cornered by various relatives who had accused them of writing the book. ‘How could someone that young know such good English. Someone must have taught him, right?’ Nishant, a black sheep of the family, had marched up to Chetan’s mother, chicken bones falling off his plate, and declared that Chetan needed to publish an apology.

‘To whom?’ Chetan’s mother asked, playing dumb.

‘Didi, a columnist has said in a national paper that Chetan is writing about our family. That all these insulting characters are from our clan. So Didi, if, as you say, Chetan has not inputted any spurious material in the book, he must pen an open letter posthaste demanding an apology from the columnist.’

‘So the columnist should write the apology?’ his mother asked.

Chetan’s hand was inches from his mother’s on the bed, but he did not move it. He was thinking: how painful it must have been for her to be told that she hadn’t raised her son correctly . . .

But you did raise me the right way, Chetan wanted to say, that’s why I speak the truth.

Instead, his mother’s tears, her abject look, hardened something in him and he said, ‘You’re being too dramatic, Mama. They’re bad people. I had no choice but to write about them.’

But was that true? What he had written was fiction; and what had emerged in the book was a self-portrait refracted through the images of childhood. Now he had learned that these images didn’t belong solely to him. His sin was that of trespassing, of moving from a mixed socialist economy to a capitalist one. Of becoming a drone who zapped the natives.

He made a clucking irritable sound and went on, ‘Who cares what they think?’ Soon, he was delivering a lecture on bourgeois values.

His mother listened meekly as unripe pods of mulberry dropped from the tree outside.

 

Chetan returned to America early, eager to set the record straight with his family, with the world. But, upon landing and going to his office – he worked as an editor for a think tank periodical – the fight went out of him. What could he do from here? What was his future now? On the flight to New York he had tried making notes, even attempted an apology, but his hand had cramped and buzzed with static; and when he had risen to go to the bathroom, another Indian man, holding up his pinky as an explanation, had jumped him in the queue. Chetan had been too dazed to respond.

Later that week, at a restaurant, his girlfriend began coughing up blood. Chetan stood up quickly, shouting for the waiter: ‘Could you please bring a hanky? A hanky!’

He had meant a napkin, which is what the waiter brought. But then everything in his mind was jostled, in transit.

‘It’s just beets,’ his girlfriend said, eyeing him wearily with her heterochromic eyes – eyes that had once beguiled him, but which he now found disquieting. ‘I’m so happy you didn’t spend that extra week there,’ she said, wiping her mouth.

‘You were right about that,’ he said, meaninglessly. But the muscles in his neck were burning. He had carried the tension from that continent to this one.

The transfer of rage from one place to another: was that his real job?

The export-import of emotions?

A few days later, he called in sick at his day-job, showered, put on his only suit, and took the subway to a broad midtown building.

The façade of the building was marked by violent downward concrete striations. Inside, a woman behind a granite reception table asked him for the floor number and photographed him for a badge.

Chetan flew upwards in an elevator and pressed the button before it reached the top floor.

Following green carpeting through canyons of white cubicles, he came to a glass conference room, where a woman and a man, his editor and agent, were waiting for him.

A sheaf of paper lay on the table, labeled Untitled Sequel.

‘So, you’re still feeling good about delivering in twelve months?’ his editor asked.

‘Yes,’ Chetan said, his accent suddenly unplaceable. ‘Very much so.’"

    "text": "First, a boy was meant to stop following him mama, then him papa, then at around fourteen him become him own man – that’s how Ras Levi say life was suppose to work.

Anyway, because of him condition, Denton was always moving and fidgeting, always doing everything inna rush, so I figure it wasn’t important, but by time I open up, Denton could hardly speak for catching him breath. Him rest him hand pon him knee, and the eczema overneath him eye did favour one crease bag, and him locs almost brush the floor. Eventually, him manage fi tell we that the pigs them were in the Gardens arresting Angela and that the community was trying to stop them. It was bedlam.

Immediately, Sister Dorothy dial the upstairs line.

‘Why yuh never come and tell we sooner?’ I say. ‘What yuh a deal with, bredda?’

Denton gave I one nasty look while him scratch him arm.  ‘I got here as fast as I could, man.’ Which was true enough:  him finish third on sports day. I ax him what the pigs accuse  Angela of, but him wouldn’t say. Him want fi wait fi Ras Joseph first, which I thought was pathetic. I ax him again, but true to him word him remain hush hush till Ras Levi and Ras Joseph Tafari appear from the fourth floor, and then Denton couldn’t stop blasted talking. Him tell all of we how Angela had been arrest in possession of explosive and plan for the bank down a the bottom of City Road. The riot police raid her yard and now them from the Mother have them pen inna the playground.

‘Babylon plant the things them on her or she really mean fi mash up the bank?’ Ras Joseph Tafari ax, and Denton confess that him never know. I glance at Ras Levi to garner his reaction, ready to dismiss Angela as irresponsible, or cowardly, or whatever language him would use, but really in I whole life I’d never heard nothing so spectacular. ‘What yuh think, Levi?’  say Ras Joseph Tafari.

I papa stroke him goatee. Him face straight. ‘If Joyce seriously mean fi damage the bank then that woman even more concern with fruitless victory than I already know her fi be.’  Him turn to his second-in-command. ‘It might be a trap fi get I&I outta the centre and inna the Garden so that them can lock I&I up without the trouble of blasting through I&I door.’ Him point at two of the older boys. ‘Unuh stay here and make sure nobody don’t come in when we gone.’ Him march from the door and the rest of we follow after him: Ras Joseph Tafari, Denton, Sister Dorothy and I, everybody in the centre except those two older boy, we tip and pour onto City Road, twenty-tree of we in total, all in our outerwear, all head toward the Garden.

I mostly knew Angela by reputation: I knew that she never belong to the centre, even when the area was one; that bald-head gossip did whisper ill-proven rumour bout her friendship with Joyce; that she help establish the Mother as a hub; I’d heard that, of the two woman, she was the more prone to violence – which now seem f i be true; and her inability to  hold liquor was well-known, mostly because the volume of her drunkenness had woken many a resident, many a time.  I knew that she was a product of the children home pon City Road and had tree fully gold teeth; and I’d heard that she once work there at the supermarket down a Broadmead but was sack for her temperament.

The bank Angela allegedly want gone stand alone at the beginning of City Road, near the corner where Frontline con- verge on Lower Ashley: another of the area lightbulb-less main road. It had a car dealership and a corner store on either side, but it remain detach – too full of itself to associate with any neighbour. Dust spiral inna the lobby. Its desk older than the area. It was red-brick where the other building in St Pauls were white or grey. Its clerks English, its manager and money too: I don’t know a single person in St Pauls who keep them money inside; only strangers rush through the doors and pass its watchmen in the foyer. Coppers patrol nearby, them detail double after dark and them German shepherds were without muzzle, and mercurial. At teatime, the few West Indian who ever attempt fi get a loan share story and spin them embarrassment into anecdote to laugh about over Ovaltine and milk biscuit.

We never pass the bank on City Road. Instead, we went down Campbell Street and across Frontline – where the sun always felt warmer. And Denton say, ‘Baba, somebody say them see the copper bring fertiliser and oil from Angela yard, the kind yuh use fi make an IED.’ I roll I eye. The only reason either of we knew what an IED was, was because every Rasta in St Pauls follow the IRA report. ‘Proper,’ is what Ras Levi would say whenever the newsman mention them on the radio. ‘It’s not our fight but them proper still,’ him would go on.

‘Them nah stand a chance of winning, Jabari, but still them a fight the fight. Them nah have a hope, because them a fight people who favour them, overs? Yuh can’t tell a English from a Irish till him talk, and an English spy can master an Irish accent, but them can’t step inside no black skin, iyah.’’

We arrive at the edge of the Gardens with Ras Levi still leading the way. The name sound fancy, but really, them were a pebble-dash maze. Nuff low-rise maisonette where the poorest people in St Pauls live. The twisting pathways were crack and without signpost. The walls were top with green-bokkle glass, and if you hadn’t grown up playing there you wouldn’t be able to orient yourself at all. That’s why the rudeboys and the sticksmen hang out there: so them could snatch chain and wallet, and be lost. Even if you live in St Pauls sometimes you did affi be careful in the Gardens, but that was dependent on who you were, I suppose: I was cool with the rudeboys and the sticksmen because them mother often come inna the centre fi food, so them did carry a certain level of respect fi Ras Levi.

The rudeboys and sticksmen, with them suit trouser and trilby, were the first people we did come across as we pass overneath the steel archway that separate Frontline from the housing estate. Them were perch pon people wall, either side of the walkway, smoking the ganja we sell them. A couple of them had the local newspaper hanging from them back pocket. Others had them wide-eye baby pon them lap as accessory. I could hear raise voice and curse word coming from the estate behind them. I thought them might’ve been in the miggle of things, but then I member say most of them were on the run for minor offence, and the rest never need any more problem with the beastman than them already have.

Them hail we as we arrive and point we toward the play- ground. We continue through the twisting, oxbow passages, passing Angela empty maisonette. Her front door was lame and open. It wood twist. The pigs had smash the panel glass. With each step the faraway voices grew louder. I could soon make out the anger of the people separate from that of the police. We turn a corner into the central square where we found a mass of people between we and the playground. Most part when them see we coming, but wherever we travel in any number our reception was mix. It was a sight to see: Iyaman in colourful dress and long hair, walking with our head held to the sky. No one was prouder or more righteous than I&I, but it was no secret that some of our fellow African try diss we; even in Jamaica there were people who would see harm come to RastafarI, all because them was desperate to be involve in the presiding colonial society, and we weren’t. The sell-outs see we as troublemaker, rabble-rouser, but we only made trouble where trouble was require: RastafarI never compromise.

Those in the Gardens who recognise the power in our unity pat Ras Levi back and praise Christ Jesus, likkle boys and girls gambol after I&I, and from them porch mamas wave them dishcloth and rag, each with one hand in the air, the other on them hip. I spot Miss Francis, standing impassion pon the roof of an abandon Allegro. The family car had been left fi so long that it was half sunk into the yellow grass, providing regular driving lesson for the local yutes. Miss Francis was a respectable woman, Ras Levi said so, cept for when she drop leaflet through the people them door, calling for a boycott of the ballot. She was too involve in English politics for RastafarI liking, because when one break the word down, politics becomes poly ticks, and you’ll find that poly mean many, and tick is a parasite. There is no freedom or song to be found in politics, only disease.

Rumour have it that Miss Francis was once a member of the Labour Party, and that she was ax fi leave fi reason unknown. Her green headwrap was tall and her Christian skirt brush the car roof as she deliver a sermon in her rough, small-island tongue: ‘All day long the whole of we complain to the pigs bout the pigs, to the council bout the council, and to the prime minister bout him own cabinet, but we must shape our own destiny!’

As we drew closer to the playground fence, the crowd became more hostile and we saw a number of feminist from the Mother Earth, but them was too preoccupy with the pigs to pay we any mind. I never see Joyce.

‘The skinhead nah go nowhere, boy,’ Miss Francis continue. ‘Take a look, them all round us in them police uniform.’ We barge our way to the front, and it was there we first see the coppers, dress in full gear, catch between the swing and the seesaw. ‘Whether it’s Labour or Conservative, them hold a sham, two-party election every five year, but capitalism is the true ruler of this here country. The pigs aren’t nothing but a group of white man employ fi carry out terrorism against the working class, and it’s our people who suffer first and most!’  The people who listen did shout in response, and at the same time I catch sight of Angela in the playground. The copper had her pon her knee, holding her collar like them hold them dog. Her head had fallen limp pon her clavicle. Her eye and  cheek bruise. I voice rose with the rest of the people and we cuss Babylon for all eternity. The uproar sweep I&I along in the rawness of it emotion, and I surrender I-self to the upset."

    "text": "The purpose of the group chat was to talk shit about Eloise’s ex-boyfriend’s new girlfriend. We were feminists so we knew it wasn’t the new girlfriend’s fault but she was from Iowa and easy to hate so we hated her with a political conscientiousness befitting smart young women who want to support other smart young women. Except that we thought she was dumb. Her Instagram was comprised of photos of pasta dishes and charcuterie boards she had made. She had a fashion Blogspot and in all her selfies wore contour, smoked eyeshadow and red lipstick, even though everybody knows you should only pick one out of three. Online she called herself a ‘shameless Sagittarius’, an ‘introverted Swiftie’, a ‘self-taught sommelier’. Her family were all Republicans, or so we’d heard, and when we looked up their address the house had a pool and a long, manicured walk. Every tidbit we found added fuel to the fire: she was short, she worked in marketing, she made TikToks, she was gluten-free. We were nice girls and we wanted to save her from herself, but also from Eloise’s ex-boyfriend, who was clearly taking advantage of someone so naive. We considered it our moral obligation to protect Midwestern girls from older city guys we knew were bad news. When we went out for drinks we saw how the transplants gallivanted down the sidewalks in groups, all dressed up in their faux-fur coats, blow-dried hair, little heeled booties. Like baby elephants grappling for a tail to hold. These women needed us. We kept an eye out for predators.

Eloise and the ex-boyfriend had dated for five years and when they broke up it took an additional year to sort through their shared belongings. Eloise took her table, her cat, her collection of Japanese kitchen knives. Her ex-boyfriend fought her on the knives, so we told her to fight him on the Bluetooth speaker, even though it had never worked well and she didn’t really want it. She pretended to want the couch, as advised, so that she could take the coffee machine too.

The last time they spoke had been a year to the day after their break-up, when Eloise went to collect the last of her books. The ex-boyfriend hadn’t even boxed them up, just left them in a stack on the kitchen counter. He found a shoebox in his closet and handed it to her. The books hardly fit.

‘What the fuck?’ Eloise told us she said. ‘Whose shoes are these?’

‘Yours?’

The shoebox was from Target. Heeled espadrilles with ribbon ties. Women’s size 8.5.

‘Absolutely the fuck not,’ Eloise said.

From there the story gets a little confused. Eloise throws the box at the ex-boyfriend, or sits down in a chair and cries, and they end up ordering Hawaiian fusion and dissecting the particulars of their break-up again. Or maybe she storms out and he runs after her, into the hallway, apologizing, insisting they’d broken up a year ago and so, of course, he’s moved on by now. He had to. He knows how to comfort Eloise the way a person only knows after five or six years of loving somebody, and when Eloise cries he stands close to her but they do not touch. It’s the not touching that makes it horrible. Maybe that’s when Eloise starts to cry. He tells her he loved her. He’s always loved her. He will always love her. The past and present tense get all mixed up. He tells her he has been seeing a girl, but it’s not serious, she’s not his girlfriend. Maybe Eloise says fuck you, or maybe Eloise says she hopes you’re happy, or maybe Eloise says that’s all fine, it’s seriously none of her business. But later it comes out that the new girlfriend was in the apartment the whole time, which Eloise will term a ‘colossal betrayal-cum-humiliation’, though her ex-boyfriend will say it was all a ‘big misunderstanding’, and later tell mutual friends that Eloise is ‘just kind of crazy’. He also uses the phrase ‘rumor mill’. That bit everybody knows for sure, because the new girlfriend goes around quoting it in his defense, and this gets back to Eloise, and so it gets back to us.

The problem with the new girlfriend is that she’s nice. It’s all anybody has to say about her. There’s really nothing we can dislike, except for the fact she exists, which isn’t her fault. That’s on her Republican parents. Instead the group chat is forced to look beyond first impressions. We craft a fuller picture, seeking out all her angles to really celebrate them. In tagged photos her eyes always skew in the wrong direction or glow camera-flash red. That’s when she really comes alive for us. We understand what she sees in Eloise’s ex-boyfriend because we understood what Eloise saw in him, even if we now call him ‘that idiot’. What we can’t understand is how a person who was in love with Eloise, the way we love Eloise, our brilliant, beautiful Eloise, could also be in love with the new girlfriend. We pity the ex-boyfriend who has clearly gone mad with grief, stabbed his eyes out like Oedipus and tied himself to the mast of a ship, Odysseus-style, to wait for any old siren to save him from the misery of his own making. The new girlfriend isn’t a siren though, she’s a field mouse. She looks like she’s never gotten wet in her life. She has a Pinterest board for ‘brunch vibes’. She has a Pinterest board called ‘spooky season’. She has a Pinterest board filled with images of Margot Robbie, and it’s clear from the number of photos that someone once told the new girlfriend that she looks like Margot Robbie – though she doesn’t, not at all, she’s just blonde. When Margot Robbie cuts her hair short, so does the new girlfriend.

‘It looks good,’ Eloise says, though we disagree.

When we show the screenshots to Eloise, she always says that we have gone too far. That the new girlfriend deserves to be happy. That her ex-boyfriend does, too. It’s not a good look to be vengeful, Eloise says. She doesn’t know that we have another group chat without her.

The secret group chat always gets active around the holidays, when we are all forced to see our own missing-limb messed-up families. We prefer to share photos from the new girlfriend’s accounts, where she and her four siblings wear matching sweaters and drink champagne with their parents. They have two Christmas trees, one upstairs and one downstairs, one dressed in silver and the other in gold. The new girlfriend wears red lipstick and red leather boots to Christmas dinner. It looks good, we have to admit, even if she doesn’t do the look justice. She is too blonde, too pointy, too much face.

We started the stalking after Eloise told us she couldn’t stop dreaming about the new girlfriend. Long, Jungian sagas in which there was always someone extra in the room, some hidden secret. This was back before we knew anything about the new girlfriend, aside from her espadrille shoes. We diagnosed Eloise with acute bad dreams, which are different from stress dreams and categorically distinct from nightmares. We figured some facts might quell the speculation. It was our duty as friends to put her mind at ease.

We started with Instagram: first, the main feed, then delving deep into tagged. The new girlfriend hadn’t bothered to scrub her history from the record so we preserved it for her, filing her past selves neatly into an archive of our own making. We taxonomized her from pimply teen to roll tide sorority girl. We knew all of her siblings by name. After that we sped through Facebook and Twitter, which were not nearly as fruitful as her Pinterest and blog. Between broken links and ads the new girlfriend turned out to be a prolific writer. She covered subjects of great interest to us, including the best way to make sugar-free toffee pudding, why loving wine did NOT make you a snob, a list of her favorite restaurants to visit in the month of September. We spent the evening trading links through the group chat and quoting from her greatest hits. Then we typed in her username and clicked forgot password, first on a whim, then a few dozen times, so it would look like a hacking attempt.

That night Eloise said she had a dream that she was being driven by a muscled blonde man – hot, she specified – who she seemed to know but not from real life. He kept offering to help her get over the ex-boyfriend – sexually, we presumed – even though it turned out that he was driving her to the ex-boyfriend’s house. When they got there Eloise said she started shaking and crying, begging the blonde man not to take her inside even though she knew he was going to, and when they got to the door the new girlfriend was there and she was brunette and tall, with high cheekbones and a tennis skirt the color of dry corn. You have my nose, Eloise told her, like the old dad joke, thumb pocketed in palm, except Eloise hadn’t meant it figuratively – the new girlfriend’s nose was identical to her own. After that, Eloise said, she forgets what happened.

‘I don’t know how my brain made up a face for this girl,’ she texted the group chat. ‘I thought people in dreams were supposed to be people you had seen in real life, like in Inception.’

‘She doesn’t look anything like that,’ we assured her. ‘She’s blonde.’

‘It’s weird you guys know this,’ she said. She was worried we had a problem with boundaries.

‘People put things online because they want other people to see them,’ we told her. ‘We’re giving her what she wants.’ To support this statement, we created a collective burner account so that we could follow the new girlfriend without exposing ourselves. But soon enough the new girlfriend had blocked us, and we realized our mistake had been anonymity. Nobody wanted a faceless gray bot on their page. So we made up another, this time furnished with photos from a distant cousin’s profile, and made sure to only like the new posts after a sufficient amount of time had passed. This ended up being useful because for a while we had all wanted to follow lots of other women without racking up clutter on our feeds. Now when we scrolled we could keep up with the new girlfriend alongside Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez.

‘Just don’t follow me,’ Eloise said, when we told her our plan. ‘It’s gonna seem like it’s my account or something.’

‘No one would think this is your account,’ we replied. We used emojis in all of the captions. We used hashtags occasionally, too.

‘I use emojis sometimes,’ Eloise said, but she didn’t.

A month later the new girlfriend announced her relationship online. That was a really good day for the group chat. We circled Eloise’s ex-boyfriend, drew arrows between his shoulder and the face of the new girlfriend, compared their photo to others: Angelina and Brad, Obama and Michelle, Kim and Kanye, Beyoncé and Jay-Z.

‘They’re definitely going to break up,’ we determined.

‘I don’t want to know,’ Eloise replied.

‘Beautiful couple,’ we responded to the Instagram story, where Eloise couldn’t see. The new girlfriend liked the message, but she didn’t say anything more. She didn’t even throw us a decent ‘thank you’. In the group chat we all call her an ungrateful bitch, and we’re joking, but really she has no idea how much work we’ve put into this, what big fans we are. One of us is almost always refreshing her stories. We turned on notifications for all of her posts. When she goes dark for a week we are desperate. We yearn. We re-review the classics: the tags, the blog, the LinkedIn. We speculate: maybe she figured us out? Maybe she blocked the account? Now we are managing multiple burners, each of us cultivating a serious following of porn bots and middle-aged Indian men. Maybe she’s doing a ‘digital detox’, but we suspect she would have warned us if it was something so benign. Her silence must be darker, more private. Maybe they’re busy moving in together. Maybe she’s pregnant. Maybe they broke up. Maybe they’re married. Maybe she died. Eloise’s ex-boyfriend offers no helpful hints or clues. He hasn’t posted in years and even when he did the photos were opaque: grayscale sunsets and shots of strange buildings. The occasional vacation carousel. A bearded dragon perched atop a low rock.

Two weeks into the new girlfriend’s silence, Eloise goes on a good date. She sends us a picture and promises he is cuter in person, more interesting than his profile suggests. We put in the requisite efforts. We google. We skim. We say things like, ‘you can totally tell that he’s cuter in person’, though really, we have no way of knowing. His photos are blurry and probably old. None show his teeth, though Eloise tells us they are normal. She’s already felt them with her tongue. In his tagged photos lives another girl, long-haired and leggy. She can be seen surfing, walking a Dalmatian, sun-tanning in a park that looks vaguely familiar. Eloise asks if she looks like her and we say no, though there is a resemblance around the eyes, in the smiling scrunch of the nose. But everyone looks like everyone else online, we say. At least a little bit. This is our working theory, anyway.

The potential new boyfriend invites Eloise to meet his friends at a concert. Everyone agrees: this is a big step. She sends us photos of outfits until she runs out of time, at which point she just puts on the first one, which we figured she would choose from the start. We know these things don’t matter – Eloise always makes a good first impression – but this is our duty as friends.

In the secret group chat we are busy coordinating our own weekend plans. Having endured three weeks of silence from the new girlfriend, we make arrangements to go to her favorite wine bar, described on her blog as both an ‘ideal second date spot’ and a ‘cozy hang’. When we arrive the bar is regular and overpriced, run by a chubby redhead and a tall man with a mustache. We scan the tables for a blonde bob and take turns skirting chairs, texting from the line by the bar, side-eyeing one another upon return. Not her. Not her. Not her. If it is her, though, we have a plan. We’ll be casual. Drop compliments. We can catch her on the way to the bathroom, or ask to borrow a pen for the check. Has she been here before? Does she live nearby? We’ll ask all the right questions until she feels comfortable, until the flow of information becomes endless. We’re girl’s girls and we know how to win a girl over. Look around the bar, there are so many of us. Drinking wine, wearing leather jackets, watching your stories, being good friends. By the time we leave, the new girlfriend will be a whole new woman. That’s what a city can do to a person: toughen them up, straighten them out, set their priorities in order. We can teach the new girlfriend things that Eloise’s ex-boyfriend could never imagine. We can offer her something better. We know just what to say.

She’s not at the bar that night, but we know she’s out there somewhere. We know her so well by now that we feel her presence like a heartbeat. In the mind’s eye of the group chat we envision her reaching for the hand of Eloise’s ex-boyfriend. Tossing his laundry in with her own. Cleaning a spot of toothpaste on the mirror of the apartment he once shared with someone else. How quickly the past might be forgotten if we weren’t here to remember it. We do our job well so that everyone else can move on.

Drunk at the concert, Eloise texts us that the potential new boyfriend’s friends are so fun – we might like them. She posts a video that is all bodies and light, and when her date smiles his teeth are normal, even cute. The video is getting weird traction online though, she says. Recently she has been accumulating new followers, cheerful women with no mutual friends and sweepstakes accounts boasting iPads and cash. At first Eloise thought it was normal – the algorithm is a mystery – but now she’s worried. Unknown accounts are watching her story. Every time she refreshes there seem to be more. They crowd out her friends list and fill her phone with alerts that disappear the moment she opens the app. We tell her to block them, we’ll investigate tomorrow. For now we have to find our own lonely ways home. We text her through the commute and on the gray, unlit walk and up the dark stairs to our beds. But as we wait for sleep via scrolling, we all get the notification at once: the new girlfriend is back. Our prayers have been answered in the form of an Instagram post. We need to coordinate so that we can all see it together, this delicious surprise just for us. We’ll finally have clarity, some much-needed new news. We get so worked up about it that we accidentally text the main chat, where Eloise tells us this has to stop, she doesn’t want us involved in it anymore. But that was only a slip-up, we know what we’re doing. We’re her friends, we’re feminists. We ask Eloise if she’s still having bad dreams and she says no – only sometimes."

    "text": "When he’s fifteen, he and his mother move to a new town and he starts at a new school. It’s not an easy age to do that – the social order of the school is already well established and he has some difficulty making friends. After a while he does make one friend, another solitary individual. They sometimes hang out together after school in the new Western-style shopping mall that has just opened in the town.

‘Have you ever done it?’ his friend asks him.

‘No,’ István says.

‘Me neither,’ his friend says, making the admission seem easy somehow. He has a simple and natural way of talking about sex. He tells István which girls at school he fantasises about, and what he fantasises about doing to them. He says that he often masturbates four or five times a day, which makes István feel inadequate since he usually only does it once or twice. When he admits that, his friend says, ‘You must have a weak sex drive.’

It may be true, for all he knows.

He doesn’t know what it’s like for other people.

He only has his own experience.

One day his friend tells him that he did it with a girl who lives on the other side of the train tracks.

The news is disorienting.

István listens while his friend describes, in some detail, what happened. He tries to work out if his friend is telling the truth or if he’s lying. Though he would prefer him to be lying, he thinks that he’s probably telling the truth. Some of the things he says seem too specific, too surprising, for him to have made them up.

Then, a few days later, he says he talked to the girl and she said she’d do it with István as well.

‘Seriously?’ István says.

‘Yeah,’ his friend says.

István doesn’t know if this means that the three of them will do it together, or just that he’ll do it with the girl on his own.

He is too unsure of himself to ask.

After school the same day, they walk across the footbridge over the train tracks.

It’s already getting dark.

They go down the metal steps on the other side of the footbridge and walk for a while until they arrive at a housing estate. It’s not dissimilar to the one where István and his mother live, only here the buildings, although also made of prefabricated concrete panels, are taller. At the entrance of one of them his friend enters the doorbell number of one of the flats.

A few moments later, without anything being said, the door unlocks and he shoulders through it.

The lift smells of cigarette smoke.

István stares at the wood-effect Formica of its interior as it goes up.

It goes up very slowly, with a continuous creaking and a separate loud ticking sound as it passes each floor.

‘You okay?’ his friend asks him.

‘Yeah,’ István says.

‘You look terrified,’ his friend says.

‘No,’ István says.

They leave the lift at one of the upper floors and his friend knocks on the door of a flat. It’s opened by a girl of about their own age. ‘Hi,’ she says.

‘Hi,’ István’s friend says.

She stands aside for them to step into the entrance hall.

‘This is my friend,’ István’s friend says. ‘You know. The one I told you about.’

‘Okay,’ the girl says.

She and István look at each other for a moment.

‘Okay?’ István’s friend says.

‘Yeah,’ the girl says.

The three of them just stand there.

The girl looks at István again.

He doesn’t look at her.

‘Okay,’ István’s friend says.

‘D’you want to wait in there?’ the girl says to him, indicating a door.

‘Yeah okay,’ István’s friend says. It’s possible that he seems disappointed, as if maybe he wasn’t sure himself whether or not they were going to do it all together, and had been sort of hoping that they would be.

István is lighting a cigarette, having to work the lighter a few times to get a flame.

His friend makes eye contact with him for a second and smiles.

István doesn’t even try to smile back. He feels something almost like panic.

He follows the girl along a short dark corridor and into a room at the end of it.

He doesn’t really take this room in, except that there’s a lot of stuff in it, including what seems to be a small animal in a cage.

The girl sits down on a bed that’s there.

István sits on a chair.

‘What’s your name again?’ the girl asks him.

He tells her.

She tells him her name.

‘You alright?’ she says.

‘Yes,’ he says.

They talk for a few minutes. She talks anyway. There are also long silences, during which the sound of the small animal moving in its cage is sometimes audible. She asks him where he’s from.

‘What’s that like?’ she asks when he tells her.

‘It’s okay,’ he says.

They sit there in silence.

She lights a cigarette, maybe just to do something.

After a while, without saying anything, she stands up and leaves.

A few minutes later the door opens again.

István looks up and sees his friend.

He expected it to be the girl.

‘What happened?’ his friend asks.

‘What do you mean?’

‘What happened?’ his friend asks again.

‘Nothing.’

‘She wants you to leave,’ his friend says. ‘What did you do?’

‘Nothing.’

‘Nothing?’

‘Yeah.’

They leave the flat and in the corridor outside his friend says, ‘Okay then, see you.’

‘Aren’t you coming?’ István asks him.

‘No she wants me to go back,’ his friend says.

‘Yeah?’

His friend nods. ‘See you round.’

‘Okay.’

Still not understanding what happened István takes the lift down on his own.

 

‘She said you weren’t sexy. That’s what she said.’ It’s a few days later and his friend is explaining it to him, what happened.

István smokes.

It’s horrible, to have that said to him, and about him, and yet he doesn’t know what to say in answer to it. It seems unanswerable.

‘She said you didn’t seem up for it,’ his friend says.

‘I was up for it,’ István says.

‘She said you didn’t seem to be.’

‘I was.’

After that things aren’t the same with his friend.

They spend less time together.

His friend starts to hang out with other people.

István spends more time on his own.

–

On Sunday he and his mother visit his grandmother. It’s her birthday. He sits there, bored, in her living room while she and his mother talk.

His mother asks him to fill a vase with water for the flowers they brought.

He goes to the kitchen and does that.

The windows are open. It’s a warm day for the time of year.

‘And how are you?’ his grandmother asks him.

‘I’m okay,’ he says.

He stands on the small balcony wishing he could smoke.

In the distance, and further down the hill, he can see the part of the town where he and his mother live.

His mother is telling his grandmother how well he’s doing at school.

His grandmother takes some money from her wallet and gives it to him, apparently as a sort of reward.

His mother tells him to say thank you.

‘Thank you,’ he says.

His grandmother smiles.

She has these travel books. They’re lined up next to each other on a shelf near the TV. Italy, France, Czechoslovakia, the USSR, West Germany, Great Britain. Out of boredom he looks at them while his mother and his grandmother talk. The books have pictures in them, mostly black and white, and a few colour ones too. The colours in them look unnatural somehow, they don’t look like the colours of things in reality.

 

There’s a lady who lives in the flat opposite them. Soon after István and his mother moved into the building, the lady asked his mother if István would be able to help her with the shopping sometimes.

‘What does that mean?’ István said when his mother told him about it.

‘She wants you to go to the shop with her and help her to carry the stuff upstairs.’

‘I don’t want to do that,’ he said.

‘She’s been very helpful to us,’ his mother said.

‘I’m not doing it,’ he said.

‘I told her you would,’ his mother said.

‘You said I’d do it?’

‘Yes I did.’

‘Why?’

‘She’s been very helpful to us,’ his mother said again. ‘And her husband has some sort of heart problem. I’m not going to argue with you about this.’

Since then, once or twice a week, he goes to the supermarket with the lady and helps her to carry the shopping home.

 

After arriving home from school he drops his backpack on the floor of the flat and then leaves again and knocks on the door of the flat opposite.

It’s opened by the lady who lives there and she tells him to wait a minute, which he does, with his hood up and his headphones on, looking down the first flight of stairs to the half-landing, where there’s a line of plants in pots on the floor next to the window. The window is set oddly low in the wall. In fact it extends below the level of the floor.

‘Okay,’ the lady says, locking the door of her own flat.

She has her coat and hat on now and they start down the concrete stairs together.

‘Is it cold out?’ she asks him, as they walk down the stairs.

He has to lift the headphones from his ears to hear her.

‘Is it cold out?’ she says again.

‘Yeah,’ he says.

They pick their way among the puddles on the uneven pavement and wait at the traffic lights.

It seems very light inside the supermarket after the wintry twilight of the street.

The lady frees her hair from her hat and loosens her scarf.

He follows her around pushing the trolley while she puts things into it.

They don’t speak.

Afterwards they walk back to the building where they live, and up the stairs. There’s no lift in the building and their flats are on the fourth floor.

‘You’re very strong,’ she says to him, as he puts the heavy stuff down on her kitchen table.

He doesn’t know what to say to that.

He just nods, and she asks him if he wants some Somloi galuska. Sometimes when they get back she offers him something to eat, something sweet like Somloi galuska.

‘Yeah okay,’ he says.

‘Sit down then,’ she says.

He sits at the table.

The Somloi galuska is in the fridge and she serves a large helping into a glass bowl and puts it in front of him, with a spoon.

‘Thanks,’ he says.

While he eats it she puts the shopping away.

He’s becoming aware that she feels a sort of affection for him, or something. It embarrasses him, and he also quite likes it in a way, even though he doesn’t feel any affection for her.

He doesn’t feel anything for her.

She’s just this old woman, maybe even older than his mother.

It’s like she hardly exists.

‘How is it?’ she asks, putting things away.

‘It’s nice,’ he says.

He eats it quickly, partly because it’s delicious and partly because he wants to be out of there as soon as possible.

When he has finished it he stands up, making the chair scrape loudly on the floor.

‘Okay then,’ he says.

‘Can I kiss you?’ she says.

She’s standing in front of him.

The question is so surprising that he doesn’t know what to say.

He doesn’t even know what she means really.

When he doesn’t say anything she kisses him on the lips. It’s nothing – her lips just lightly touch his for a moment.

‘I’m sorry,’ she says, immediately afterwards.

He just stands there.

‘I think you should go now,’ she says.

Still without saying anything he leaves and walks across the landing and lets himself into his mother’s flat.

–

The lights are on in the classroom, strip lights on the ceiling in translucent plastic boxes. The boxes contain a fair number of dead flies – blurred little shapes that he sometimes stares at while the teacher speaks. Only a few people are even pretending to listen to the teacher, who’s reading aloud from a book. ‘In broad terms, individuals that are more “fit” have better potential for survival. However, modern evolutionary theory defines fitness not by how long an organism lives, but by how successful it is at reproducing. If an organism lives half as long as others of its species, but has twice as many offspring surviving to adulthood, its genes become more common in the adult population of the next generation.’ It’s the last lesson of the afternoon.

Afterwards he walks home.

He’s taking the stairs two at a time when suddenly she’s there, in front of him, holding a small plastic watering can. She’s watering the plants on the half-landing between the floors. He hasn’t seen her since the last time they went to the supermarket together, when they kissed afterwards. ‘Hello István,’ she says, without stopping what she’s doing.

‘Hello,’ he says.

He just stands there a few steps down from her, still panting slightly. To see her again makes it even stranger to think that he actually kissed her.

She asks him if he can come to the supermarket with her.

‘Okay,’ he says.

As usual, they don’t speak to each other while they do the shopping.

It’s only when they’re back in her flat that she says, ‘I’m sorry about what happened the other day.’

It surprises him that she should say that. It makes it sound like she did something to him, whereas the way he’s been thinking about it, it was something that they did together.

‘It’s okay,’ he says.

‘Is it?’ she asks.

He’s not sure what he’s supposed to say.

He doesn’t say anything.

‘Did you tell anyone?’ she asks him.

‘No,’ he says.

He hasn’t told anyone. He has no one to tell. And even if he did, what would he tell them? That he’d kissed someone old and ugly like her?

–

The next time they get back from the supermarket and she asks him if he wants some Somloi galuska, he hesitates and then says, ‘Yeah okay.’

She tells him to sit down and puts a bowl of it in front of him, with a spoon and a folded paper napkin.

‘Thanks,’ he says.

While he eats it she puts the shopping away.

He has just stood up from the table and is wiping his mouth with the paper napkin when she says, ‘Can I?’

It’s obvious what she means.

‘Okay,’ he says, after a few seconds. He doesn’t know why he says that. Some part of him seems to want to.

Her lips lightly touch his for a moment, just like the first time.

‘Thank you,’ she says, not looking at him.

‘That’s okay,’ he says.

Still not looking at him, she waits for him to leave.

When he understands that that’s what she’s waiting for, he walks across the landing and lets himself into his mother’s flat.

After that they kiss every time. It becomes part of what they do when they go to the supermarket. She offers him something to eat, and then she lightly touches her lips to his for a moment, and then he leaves.

–

One day she suggests that they sit on the sofa.

He has never been in her living room. He doesn’t really take it in, except that there’s a balcony at one end, like there is in his mother’s flat, with a balustrade made of panels of green safety glass.

They sit on the sofa.

‘Have you ever kissed anyone properly?’ she asks.

Embarrassed that the answer is no, he pretends not to be sure what she means. He doesn’t say anything anyway.

‘Do you want to kiss me properly?’ she asks.

‘Alright,’ he says.

His heart is unexpectedly thumping.

‘Yeah?’ she says.

He just nods.

He can hear a clock ticking.

She touches her lips to his, like she’s done in the kitchen a few times, only now she keeps them there, and presses them more strongly against his.

Something about the angle at which they’re turned to each other is awkward and they shift their positions slightly.

She moves her lips to his again, and this time she opens her mouth and he feels her tongue on his lips and then opens his own mouth and her tongue goes into it.

He shuts his eyes so that he doesn’t have to see her, so that he only feels her lips, and her tongue inside his mouth.

‘Was that nice?’ she says.

He nods.

‘Do you want to do it again?’ she asks.

‘Okay,’ he says.

They do it again and while they’re doing it one of her hands brushes against his erection, which is pushing out the fabric of his trousers.

He was hardly aware of it himself until her hand accidentally brushed against it.

As soon as that happens, he feels her tense up.

Embarrassed, he pulls away from her.

‘What is it?’ she says, trying to take his hand.

He’s already on his feet.

‘What is it?’ she says again. ‘It’s okay.’

It’s not okay, he thinks, looking down at her.

She disgusts him. Without saying anything else, he leaves.

He goes down the stairs and out of the building and walks around for almost an hour without really knowing where he is or where he’s going.

When he gets back she’s waiting on the landing.

‘Are you okay?’ she asks.

‘Yeah,’ he says.

 

After that he’s sure that he isn’t going to kiss her again. Then, a few days later, when she asks if he wants to sit on the sofa with her, he finds that part of him does.

‘Do you want to?’ she asks.

They’re standing in her kitchen, facing each other.

She’s quite tall, nearly as tall as he is.

‘Okay,’ he says.

He follows her into the living room and they sit on the sofa and start to kiss again, with tongues.

This time, when her hand finds his erection, she seems deliberately not to do anything that might distress him. She just keeps kissing him in the same way and leaves her hand there, on top of his trousers. Then, after a few minutes, she starts to move it slowly up and down. She pushes her tongue further into his mouth so that it’s almost too much, so that he instinctively moves his head away and she slightly withdraws her tongue. Her hand is still moving slowly up and down in a way that he likes, although it’s moving much more slowly than he would move his own hand, and maybe because of that, because it’s moving so much more slowly than he would move his own hand, he realises too late that he’s about to come.

The sound he makes is like a gasp of pain.

A moment later he’s aware of the wetness inside his trousers, and then the smell of it.

It feels like a disaster, what’s happened.

He has no idea what to do, no idea if she will even understand.

She seems surprised too.

She has stopped kissing him.

He isn’t looking at her. He’s looking at the floor, at the fringed edge of the rug.

If he looked at her he would see that she was smiling at him. But he doesn’t look at her. He doesn’t want to see her. He is ashamed and also sort of horrified that he is doing this with someone old and ugly like her.

‘Go on,’ she says, and he stands up and leaves.

 

A little later there’s a knock at the door of the flat.

It’s her.

He wonders if she wants to talk to his mother, who’s still at work – maybe to tell her what’s been happening, an idea that makes him feel something like terror.

Actually it’s him she wants to talk to.

‘Are you alright?’ she says.

She says it in a soft, kind voice that surprises him.

‘Yes,’ he says.

‘What happened before,’ she says. ‘I just want you to know – it’s okay. If you were embarrassed or I don’t know. You don’t need to be. It’s okay.’

He doesn’t say anything.

‘I just wanted to say that,’ she says. ‘That’s all.’

‘Okay,’ he says.

‘Okay,’ she says, and he shuts the door.

–

Sometimes at the weekend he works on her husband’s allotment. Her husband pays him to do that.

The thick mud sticks to his shoes so that after a while his feet feel heavy in them and start to look like lumps of mud themselves.

The lady’s husband says that he can’t do physically demanding work any more.

He has heart trouble, he says.

He has to take pills.

István isn’t really listening. The days are getting warmer. He pulls off his jumper and hangs it on a fence post.

‘You’re a good worker,’ the lady’s husband says, offering him a cigarette. ‘Don’t you smoke?’ he asks when István doesn’t immediately take it.

‘Not really,’ István says. His mother doesn’t know that he smokes and he’s worried that the lady’s husband will mention it to her.

‘What does that mean? Do you want one or not?’

István takes one.

‘For me they’re basically free,’ the lady’s husband says, and explains that he works at the cigarette factory.

‘Okay,’ István says.

He stands there in a damp T-shirt enjoying the smoke and the feeling of the cool air on his sweaty forehead.

There’s the sound of the main road, which isn’t far away.

When they finish work that day, after they have washed their hands at the standpipe, the lady’s husband asks him if he wants a drink.

‘I think we’ve earned one,’ he says.

The place he takes him to is a sort of wine cellar, in a side street not far from the allotment, down some steps from the pavement. The lady’s husband seems to be well known down there. Half-drunk old men say hello to him as he moves through the smoke.

The woman at the bar says hello to him as well and they exchange some chat as he orders the drinks – two white wine spritzers.

The woman lifts a lid set directly in the zinc bar and dips a ladle down there for the wine.

‘This is István,’ the lady’s husband says to her as she does that.

She just raises a painted-on eyebrow.

‘He’s helping me on the allotment.’

‘That’s nice.’

She adds soda to the glasses from a hose. There’s something suggestive about the way her hand holds the hose, István thinks, about the way the soda shoots out when she does something with her fingers.

‘Bit more,’ the lady’s husband says.

She shoots another slug of soda into the glass.

‘Thanks,’ he says.

He offers her a cigarette, which she takes.

‘For me they’re basically free,’ he says.

She nods, as if it’s something she’s heard before, and lets him light it for her.

With the cigarette in her mouth she takes the spritzers, one in each hand, and holds them out for them.

‘I think we’ve earned that,’ the lady’s husband says, as they take their seats at a table.

He lifts his glass towards István for a moment and then drinks half of it in one go.

István starts on his more cautiously.

He doesn’t really like the taste of the wine.

‘How you settling in?’ the lady’s husband asks him. He knows that István is still quite new to the town.

‘Okay,’ István says.

–

The next time they sit on the sofa, she stops kissing and draws away from him. He opens his eyes. ‘Can I?’ she asks, looking at him. She has started to undo his belt.

He just nods.

Awkwardly he raises his hips from the sofa to help her as she pulls the trousers and pants down to his knees.

It’s the first time that anyone else has seen him like this.

It feels strange, to have someone else there, looking at it.

She touches it with her hand, and then lowers her mouth to it.

To be comfortable, though, she has to kneel on the floor.

She kneels on the floor and takes it in her mouth again. He’s looking at the top of her head, at the roots of her hair where the blonde, he now sees, is slightly mixed with grey. He wonders how it is that her teeth aren’t hurting him, that her mouth is so soft. He feels himself already starting to come as he stares up at the ceiling, and then at the balcony, where the afternoon sun is glowing in the green glass panels, and then at the top of her head again, which is moving faster now. And now she’s doing something with her tongue that just . . . It’s almost too much, almost like pain, though not pain, the opposite of pain.

He makes a small, startled sound.

Her head stops moving.

Her mouth slides off him. Her eyes are shut. So is her mouth – she inhales through her nose.

After a few seconds she stands up and leaves and from the kitchen he hears the sound of water in the sink.

He has this peaceful feeling.

For a minute or two he feels extremely at ease, just sitting there looking at the tidy living room, and at the balcony with the sun glowing in the panels of green glass.

On the balcony, in the sunlight, is a big jar with lots of small cucumbers in it, submerged in a sort of milky liquid. Crammed in at the top of the jar is what seems to be wet bread.

She’s making kovászos uborka, fermented pickles.

She comes back and sits down next to him on the sofa, and seeing her he again feels confused and sort of ashamed that he is doing this with someone like her, with a woman who might be older than his mother, who makes kovászos uborka.

She’s stroking his hair.

‘Did you like that?’ she asks.

He nods.

Afterwards he walks down the stairs and sits on a bench in the little park near the housing estate.

There’s a man on the next bench who’s smoking a cigarette.

István asks him if he can buy one.

‘You can have one,’ the man says.

István goes back to his own bench and sits there smoking the cigarette that the man gave him. The dry petals of chestnut flowers fall onto the asphalt path. They move on the asphalt with a papery sound, and when the wind stops they lie still.

–

She shows him her breasts. The nipples are weird – surprisingly big, and brown, and with these little things like warts on them.

When he first sees them he’s slightly disgusted. But then later, thinking about them, he masturbates more than once.

He finds it strange how, at the same time, he can find them slightly disgusting and also be so turned on by them, or by the memory of them.

It’s partly the way she showed them, he thinks.

He was sitting at her kitchen table eating Somloi galuska while she put the shopping away and then, when she had finished doing that, she asked him if he wanted to see them and he said yes, and she just showed them to him – standing there in the kitchen she took off first her shirt and then her bra. It’s the memory of her doing that that turns him on, as much as what they actually looked like. What they actually looked like seems almost irrelevant. Or that they were weird and slightly disgusting might even have had the effect of turning him on more.

When he had finished the Somloi galuska, they went to the sofa and kissed for a while and then she undid his trousers and sucked him off again.

Then he left.

 

The next time it happens she says, ‘I swallowed it.’

‘Yeah?’ he says, still with that peaceful feeling he always has for a few minutes afterwards.

She nods, sort of smiling at him.

‘Okay,’ he says.

‘Will you do something for me?’ she asks.

‘Okay,’ he says.

She takes his hand and puts it between her legs. She lifts her skirt up to her waist – she is wearing black tights underneath it – and puts his hand where she wants it.

She presses it there firmly.

The place where she presses it is soft and yielding through the layers of fabric.

When he does nothing, she starts to move his hand herself.

She positions his fingers precisely.

‘Like that,’ she says. ‘There. Like that.’

She lets go of his hand and he moves it himself.

There’s something wrong with the way he is doing it though.

She takes hold of his hand again, and moves it energetically, pressing it into her. ‘Like that.’

‘Okay,’ he says.

She shuts her eyes.

He keeps doing it until his arm gets tired.

‘Thank you,’ she says, when he stops.

–

On Sunday his mother takes him to lunch at the McDonald’s in the new shopping mall. The McDonald’s only opened a few months ago.

His mother watches him eat. She isn’t eating herself. She has a paper cup of McDonald’s coffee that she occasionally takes a sip from. ‘How’s school?’ she asks.

‘It’s fine,’ he says.

‘At the parent–teacher meeting last week,’ she says. ‘They said you seem distracted sometimes.’

He shrugs.

‘Your marks have slipped a bit.’

‘Yeah?’ he says.

‘I wonder if it’s that you’re spending too much time playing those computer games,’ she suggests.

‘No,’ he says.

‘Then?’

‘What?’

‘I’m just trying to understand,’ she says. ‘Are you making friends?’

‘Yeah.’

‘Yeah?’

He nods, not looking at her.

‘That’s good,’ she says.

He isn’t sure if she believes him or not.

–

He and the lady walk to the supermarket. It’s raining. He holds the umbrella over them both. ‘I want to make love with you,’ she says when they are in her kitchen again. ‘I want to feel you inside me. Do you want to do that?’

‘Okay,’ he says.

‘Is your mother at home?’

‘No,’ he says.

They do it on his bed. She insists on the window shutter being fully lowered – maybe because of what happened when she showed him her breasts, the look of slight disgust or whatever it was that she must have seen on his face then.

She puts the condom on him herself. He lies on his back on the bed and she lowers herself onto him. He just lies there while she moves her hips and makes quiet noises. He can’t really see her in the near-darkness with the shutter down.

A few moments after he comes she stops moving.

He feels himself shrink inside her until his dick slides out. It feels like it sort of slides out sideways. It’s a strange feeling.

She leans down to him so that he smells her breath when she says that he’s a man now, and asks him how that feels.

He thinks it’s strange that he doesn’t feel any different, that nothing seems to have changed. He doesn’t say that. He just sort of shrugs, still lying there on his back, and she moves away from him and starts to get dressed again.

‘Are you alright?’ she asks, when he doesn’t say anything for a while.

‘Yes,’ he says.

‘Okay,’ she says. And then speaking to him out of the near-darkness she says that she feels honoured that he did it for the first time with her, and thanks him, and then she leaves, and he doesn’t move for a while.

He has a shower.

In the shower he gets hard again and masturbates.

It takes him a long time to come.

When he finally does, he leans against the tiled wall and listens to the water pecking at the plastic shower curtain, still thinking that it’s strange that he doesn’t feel any different, that everything seems to be the same.

He takes the bus into town and has a Big Mac Meal.

It’s early evening when he gets back. The street lights have just come on, all at the same time. Their light looks green which makes the sky look purple.

He meets her husband at the entrance of the building.

‘Hello István,’ he says. ‘How are you?’

‘Okay.’

‘After you,’ her husband says, holding the heavy front door open for him. It’s made of metal with two panels of security glass. István goes in first and they walk through the low entrance hall past the mailboxes and up the concrete stairs together.

‘What have you been up to?’ her husband asks.

‘Nothing much,’ István says.

–

For a few days he doesn’t see her. He masturbates quite a lot, at least twice a day. Usually when he does that he’s thinking of her, and of the things they have done together. Otherwise he doesn’t think of her much. Except that he finds he does want to fuck her again. After a while he is unable to stop thinking about that, and the thought that it might not happen again is surprisingly difficult to deal with. Sometimes he wonders if he should knock on her door. Something always stops him.

Then, at the end of the week she knocks on his door. He pauses the computer game that he’s playing and opens it.

‘Hello,’ she says.

He doesn’t say anything, embarrassed that he already has a hard-on at just the sight of her standing there.

He puts his hands in his pockets.

She asks if he can come to the supermarket with her.

‘Okay,’ he says. ‘I’ll put my shoes on.’

She nods.

They walk to the supermarket initially in silence as usual.

Then, as they wait at the traffic lights, she says to him, ‘What are you listening to?’

‘What?’ he says.

‘What are you listening to?’

He has his headphones on and is listening to music.

‘MC Hammer,’ he says.

‘What’s it like?’

He shrugs.

‘Can I listen?’ she asks.

He passes her the headphones, and she puts them over her ears.

‘I don’t like it,’ she says, after only a few seconds.

‘Okay,’ he says.

When they get back he puts the shopping on her kitchen table. It’s a warm day and his T-shirt is sticking to his skin.

She asks him if he wants some ice cream.

‘Okay,’ he says.

‘Sit down then,’ she says.

He sits and waits while she serves him some ice cream in one of those glass bowls she has.

‘Rákóczi túrós,’ she says.

‘Okay,’ he says.

‘You like that don’t you?’

He nods.

While he is eating it she sits down next to him. After just sitting there for a minute, she puts her hand on his knee.

‘Is your mother at home?’ she asks.

‘No,’ he says.

 

‘Try not to come so quickly,’ she says.

She twists and thrusts her hips while he lies there looking at the underside of the pine shelf on the wall above his bed.

Her movements become more urgent and he has a strange feeling that she’s no longer aware of him.

Suddenly she stops moving altogether.

There’s a moment of tension.

Then something happens.

She goes limp.

She puts her arms around him and lies still for a minute.

He feels the sweat on her, and on himself. It’s hard to say whose sweat it is. There’s a slippery layer of sweat between them.

Outside the sun is shining. The shutter is down but there are some small holes in it which let a bit of light through, enough to see her as she dresses, now that his eyes are used to the gloom.

She has pubic hair, and a track of hair on her belly.

In porn none of the women have pubic hair, or not that much anyway.

None of the women have weird nipples like hers.

 

As long as no one knows about it, it’s like it isn’t really happening.

It’s like it exists in the same way that his fantasies exist, as something he’s just imagining.

That’s how it seems to him sometimes.

 

He doesn’t see her at the weekend, when her husband is at home.

He just wanders around the town.

He spends a long time in the second-hand shop looking at the computer games, the crate of cassettes in scuffed plastic boxes. The games are pirate copies, with badly photocopied instructions.

There’s pirated music too, all the latest stuff from the West – Vanilla Ice, Madonna, Guns N’ Roses.

He leaves the shop without buying anything.

The weekend seems to last forever.

 

On Monday they do it twice. In between they just lie there on the bed. There’s the sound of the rain on the window – they can hear it sometimes but they can’t see it because the shutter is down. After they have been lying there for a while she starts to suck him and he quickly becomes hard again. ‘Do you want to take me from behind?’ she asks.

‘Okay,’ he says.

She turns, and he sort of kneels on the soft mattress trying to find the place.

The rain patters on the window.

‘No not there,’ she says.

She has to reach back with her hand to help him.

She’s already extremely wet.

It feels different from that angle.

She worries, afterwards, that they didn’t use a condom the second time.

He isn’t sure why she’s worrying – he assumed she was too old to get pregnant.

How old are you?’ he asks her.

‘Forty-two,’ she says.

    "text": "‘Anyway,’ their dining companion concluded, ‘to most people, this is more acceptable than that.’ She waved her fork on the diagonal, pointing first to her husband and herself, then to them. She and her husband were the this and they were the that. ‘Oh come on,’ she added, as if exasperated by their incomprehension. ‘Of course it matters which one of you is white.’ It was a very long dinner toward the end of an even longer year. After, they walked home along the river, just the two of them.

‘I think we’re becoming unsocialized.’

‘Yes, that must be it.’

The advice, if that’s what it was, was discarded from their minds, lightly as an empty tissue box. They didn’t remember it until a few hundred miles into the road trip when, as is so often the case, you find yourself in need of tissues – he had just sloshed cold coffee across his lap (‘Shit!’) – and when, glancing out the window, you discover that you have no idea where you are. They’d spent the morning at Gettysburg. Now it was afternoon, and Jefferson Davis Highway unfurled seedily before them. Her uncle, an estranged relation getting on in years, lived somewhere off it; it was with him they’d spend the night. Meanwhile they ate up mile after mile with the amazement of people who’ve never driven this far south before.

‘– a whole highway named after him!’

‘– can you believe – !’

‘Go straight,’ directed the woman inside the phone, ‘for two hundred kilometers.’ The road signs spoke miles, but Anand refused to trade the units he’d grown up with for a system demonstrably less sensible. He loaded up the playlist.

On the horizon, strong evidence of a storm.

‘I thought we were too far inland for hurricanes.’

‘General apocalypse, I guess.’

They took road trips like these once or twice a year. As the papers were fond of pointing out, many millions of millennials were reluctant to leave the coasts, had never even Googled Yellowstone. And even if they did, or would, what they’d find was pictures of the thousands of foreign tourists who arrived by Megabus each year to watch the geysers go.

So maybe the roadtrippers were entitled to feeling a bit superior. But they were still strangers in their own nation. Everyone is, if you drive far enough.

‘But I am a foreigner.’

‘You just got citizenship. You’re stuck with us now.’

And what a big country it was! They’d taken the week to see some more. He’d autoreplied his .org inbox; she, her .edu. They’d filled the rental tank, stocked the cupholders with snacks, and taken off over the Verrazano. They didn’t have to go so far before everything became unfamiliar. Really, just over the Verrazano. They rolled down the windows. The direction was south; the goal, Savannah. A Senate race was imminent, and they planned to knock on some doors.

Not until Jefferson Davis Highway did the dining companion’s comment return. Diana was fishing through the plastic sacks for chips and further napkins.

‘I wonder if we’re not exactly the volunteer profile they’re looking for?’

 

New York had the reach of cottonwood or pollen. It defined an ecosystem all its own. Only midway through Pennsylvania did you escape its sweep and a new kind of flora emerge: narrower roads; affordable real estate; tractor trailers galumphing down lane one. The Midwest loomed somewhere in Erie. You could tell by the way the land flattened and the woodlands narrowed to windbreaks between the farms, and by the layout of the convenience stores, which shared in common taupe wire shelves and the tart, musty smell of packaged bread. Onward to Ohio, where the interstates swung wide around modest skylines, giving the buildings wide berth, working up the centrifugal momentum to speed through Indiana, Illinois, on to someplace worth the hotel costs. Montana, maybe. Or Sun Valley, Idaho, where the vacation homes returned and the all-inclusive tour buses glided through bruised and violet landscapes as alien as advertised . . . That was last year’s trip. On the way, they’d visited her parents in Indianapolis.

‘Never again,’ she said, propping her feet up on the dash.

‘It wasn’t so bad.’

Now the South came in thick and choppy through the open windows. He loved to drive. She didn’t think he should (climate!), but what an experience, the roads of this country. It was stomach-turning, really, how roomy a nation could be. The interstate was god. Anand believed. He’d grown up in the kind of metropolis where traffic sorts itself into sedimentary layers, socialist-era cars fanning out to rickshaws, bicycles, cows, goats, chickens, foot traffic, loiterers, schoolkids, scooters that darted every which way, honking at the schoolmarm signs: No horns! Once, during a period of communal unrest, his cab driver had tapped a man’s thigh with the car. He’d nearly run him over. Such accidents were more common than Diana might have guessed. The real mistake had been getting out of the vehicle to check on the pedestrian in the gathering crowd, when tensions were so high . . .

CCR whined from the dash.

There was hardly any foot traffic in this country, certainly not on Jefferson Davis Highway.

‘Slow down,’ Diana cried, as he wedged the rental between two semis. ‘Slow down, slow down, slow down!’

 

No matter where they drove, what borders they crossed, Anand preferred to traverse new terrain with guidebooks, apps, recommendations solicited from email chains and message boards. Museum tours were researched in advance and audio guides reserved. This was a major difference between them. It was to Diana’s great relief, then, arriving at Gettysburg earlier that morning, that the museum was fresh out of auditory apparatuses. She’d gone to the car to change her shirt while Anand had made absolutely sure. They’d commenced, regretfully or mercifully, depending on your perspective, with nothing but their phones.

One did not have high hopes for Gettysburg. Nor for Pennsylvania in general. Having grown up in Indiana, Diana felt she’d earned her condescension. It broadcast her distance. But Gettysburg was on the way and in the end had outperformed. They exited the visitor center and into the scorch of national lore. It was hard to see, in such weather, the advantage of wool uniforms.

‘Actually –’

‘I’m joking, it was a joke,’ she said.

The battlefield lay across a narrow road. They paused to allow a sky-blue pickup truck to pass. The driver also slowed, stopped, looked them over. After a halting pause – should they, shouldn’t they, would he squash them to a pulp? – he waved them across.

The sun was high, the air heaving and humid. The heat formed a blister over the grass. Outside a modest whitewashed house, the kind of structure raised in a day by horse and rope, they read a little plaque. Here was Union HQ, it said. Ahead, the lawn descended the gentle slope that had given General Meade such a historically significant edge. They stood there an extra beat, rereading the same sentences multiple times. Anand suppressed a smile.

‘What’s so funny?’

‘Same to you.’

She laughed. ‘Nothing’s funny.’

It came to light that they’d both been wondering what the driver of the pickup had thought about a couple like them.

 

Even someone with zero knowledge of military strategy (and this was Diana to a fault) could recognize, standing atop the knoll, how terribly advantageous it was to defend an attack from above. You could see everything. (There, in the distance, were the woods where the Confederates had chilled themselves, sleeping in the dew in non-wicking cotton.) In the scant shade of a copse, a guide was addressing a pair of women at opposite extremes of the weight distribution: a thin, nervous-looking specimen tried so hard to disappear beneath her sun hat that you couldn’t help but stare, while her capacious friend radiated a generous attention. (If Diana had had a musket, she thought, neither would stand a chance.) Anand consulted the map. The thing to do was walk across the field, clamber over the fence, and peek into the woods where the Confederates had begun their charge. It really was quite a ways to march. Off they went. They clambered. They arrived. They peered into the trees.

‘That’s that.’

On their return, by the copse, another memorial plaque made an appearance; on it, someone had laid a bouquet in honor of fallen Confederates. The roses were a deep, expensive red. Anand shook his head.

In the car, hours later and hundreds of miles south, a deep sunburn bloomed across Diana’s shoulders.

‘I wore long sleeves!’

‘Should’ve tried wool!’

 

Anand thought it very strange that Diana had never met her uncle, especially as she had no other uncles or aunts or cousins to meet. ‘That’s wild,’ he’d said, when he found out. Diana shrugged. She hadn’t met a lot of her family.

‘Salt and vinegar, or sour cream and onion?’

She handed Anand more napkins for his lap and popped open the tube of chips. (Sour cream and onion.) He was probing the matter again, she felt, like a kid left alone on the beach with a stick. Was it an argument, an affair, an inheritance dispute? She snorted, spewing crumbs.

‘What inheritance!’

It was none of these things.

She turned to the trees and gas stations of the anonymous landscape outside. ‘I did visit once. Right after college. I drove all the way down. He didn’t show. So, I guess don’t get your hopes up.’

Together, Jefferson Davis and Anand drew the rest of the story out of her. The truth was, there had a been a cousin once, seven years her senior, whom she’d also never met. This too was wild. Was it? She was used to silences. It was much more like her family to let things lie. The cousin had died at fourteen of a rare strain of blood cancer. It was too hard on everyone, in the following years, to present another little girl who reminded them so much of her.

‘Honestly, maybe we shouldn’t. I can look up the motel I stayed in last time. It had a pool.’

Diana reached for her phone. Anand covered the screen.

‘It’s a good thing to do,’ he said. ‘I’m proud of you.’

She cradled the chips. ‘Maybe just keep your eyes on the road.’

The remaining facts she knew about the uncle were few. For example, he was the only other person in her family to have earned a college degree. In the arts, specifically, courtesy of the GI Bill and the Korean War. Active duty had left him a little eccentric. It was his degree, however, that her parents most commented on. Her own mother was a typist, skilled enough in shorthand to have chanced Chicago, where she’d met Diana’s father, a bridge player at the time. He played professionally for years before earning his accounting license. Neither had seen the point of university back then, but pity the person who thought it was because they hadn’t been clever enough. When Diana had come home junior year chattering about her history thesis (‘Messianic Expectations in Socialist Yugoslavia, 1929–1992’), her father had remarked, not a little saltily, ‘Sounds like a load of over-intellectualized bullshit to me.’ It had stung at the time. But she’d been all of twenty, and her father wasn’t quite wrong. Though, following the logic through, that still didn’t make him right.

Her father had performed many jobs over the years. Taxi driver. Lab assistant. Bookkeeper. Carpenter. He was rather proud of Diana, she knew, whether or not he had the words, and frankly she was proud of him, too. The problem was expressing it. The problem was that she felt ashamed of her parents at times, or perhaps the better word was confused. She didn’t know how to place them. It was like showing up for dinner with an unruly bouquet to find the host keeps only a delicate little vase. The first time her parents had met Anand, over tourist spaghetti in Manhattan (‘Miserable fucking city,’ was her father’s – again – not totally incorrect pronouncement), they’d complimented his English, by which they meant that they were surprised that he spoke it much better than they did. ‘Thanks,’ Anand said. ‘It is definitely my first language.’ He added that a lot of the students back home spoke better English than their teachers, who came from more modest backgrounds. Her parents nodded, uncomprehending. Diana considered drowning herself in her personal vat of spaghetti.

The exit appeared. She held out a chip to Anand. He ate it out of her hand. ‘Narm narm num,’ he articulated.

A final thing Diana knew about her uncle was that her own college tuition had been drawn from the fund her cousin had never had the chance to use. After she died, it had sat there, accruing interest, for eleven intervening years.

‘It’s nothing to feel guilty about,’ Anand said.

It really was a beautiful country, as long as you had no memory.

Wrung of its history, the land greets its visitors with the complete indifference of a stolen thing.

 

The uncle lived on a cul-de-sac in a neighborhood comprised of what had once been called starter homes but which now bore the signs of urban decay. The sky was still and gray when they arrived, draped ominously low over the roofs. The house sat on a respectable stretch at the far edge of the development, abutting a strip of trees. The driveways were designed for one car each, though most held two, none of them new.

She would have been able to guess which was her uncle’s even without the address. Part of her still hoped she was mistaken.

Improvised sculptures were staked all over the weedy lawn. The majority were abstract. One was definitely a shotgun. The hedges at the door were not so much hedges but brush, and the house was in visible disrepair. The eaves sank; the roof buckled; the shingles were ripe with moss. After decades sculpting models for a local automobile plant, now her uncle lived alone and made the art he liked, apparently in vast quantities. His wife, much younger, had left after their daughter died.

At the door, Diana knocked. Anand followed with the bags.

‘No one home?’

‘Looks like no.’

‘I’m sure he’ll come.’

They sat on the front step to wait.

Anand was correct. It wasn’t long before her uncle made his memorable entrance. He sped in on a dirt bike in a flurry of dust and growling noise. The brakes throttled backwards; his was the torso of a much younger man. Diana had only ever seen a picture, and that he’d seemed handsome then was confirmed again as he removed the helmet with its long, pointed chin. His white hair was full and cropped, his features set deep in a face almost gaunt. Diana was grateful Anand remained so reliably delicate when it came to first impressions.

‘Wow,’ he said. ‘Nice bike.’

Thirty minutes later, her uncle was leading Anand in circles around the house, teaching him to ride. It had never occurred to Diana that riding a motorcycle –’Sorry, sorry, not a motorcycle . . . !’ – required so much balance. There were no three-wheeled dirt bikes, of course, and one had to start somewhere. It certainly made a racket. She kept waiting for one of the neighbors to come out and complain, but either they were used to it or they had fled long ago. Anand, straddling the roaring engine, tapped along the green on tiptoe, weaving through the crowded sculpture garden whose rusted copper shapes erupted in teal and pink and orange. Her uncle, at his elbow, guided him patiently. So patiently, in fact, that it was almost as if he didn’t want to go inside. It was dark by the time Anand was able to circle the cul-de-sac on his own. Still parked on the front steps, Diana clapped when he pulled into the drive. Her uncle lumbered over. A silence swelled with the ridiculous things neither could bring themselves to say: Nice to meet you . . . So here we are . . . Uh, thanks for paying my tuition . . . Diana drummed her hands on her thighs.

Her uncle spat thickly into the bushes. ‘You sure you don’t want to try?’

 

The house was crammed with family pictures and more art, two bedrooms, and a bath wedged between. Diana set out her toothbrush and face wash and expensive creams at the sink. She reapplied some much-needed deodorant. Anand was in their room, humming eighties hits from their road trip playlist and setting out a change of clothes. Back home, in high school, he’d played briefly in a cover band; he broke fully into song.

‘Maybe if you joined a different band –’

‘If you want an autograph, just ask.’

‘The very occasional silence can also be harmonious.’

The purple bed was piled with pillows, as if a seasonal sale were going on: last call for throw cushions in aisle four. A border of ivy crawled along the baseboards. It was undoubtedly a little girl’s room. The violet plush of the carpet crunched, stiff with lack of use.

Diana shouldered her purse and surveyed the luggage. ‘Is my bag still in the car?’

‘I thought you brought yours in yourself.’

The asphalt released the day’s heat into the night. Diana hopped from one bare foot to the other in the driveway, looking into the rental trunk. No luck.

In the purple bedroom, they backtracked, recreating the afternoon. It had been so hot and clear in Gettysburg: while Anand was inquiring as to the audio guide options, she’d returned to the car for long sleeves to avoid the very sunburn she’d nevertheless incurred. She mimed opening the trunk of the rental car:

‘– I took out my bag –’

‘– and put it where? –’

‘– and then I took off the shirt I was wearing –’

‘– right in the middle of the parking lot? –’

‘– and then –’

‘– and then you put on this shirt? –’

‘– obviously, and then –’

‘– you put the bag back?’

Diana lowered herself to the foot of the bed, her head into her hands. ‘Honestly, how did you not run over it?’

‘Sorry for being such a careful driver!’

She lifted her collar to her nose. ‘I’m already starting to smell.’

It was too late to call the museum. With a sinking feeling, she recalled the public transit warnings in New York: all that lost baggage, needlessly destroyed. She stripped and curled up next to Anand in the bed dressed for a child.

‘I hate sleeping naked in other people’s homes.’

Laughing, he reached for her.

‘No, seriously, it’s weird.’

 

That she’d never known all that much about her family came into focus in the wide-angle lens of adulthood. She didn’t know her family better. But she understood them in a different light. In certain settings or times of day (a party, her office hours, departmental committees), her forebearers were recognized as workers, and worthy of praise; everything real in this country had been produced by hand, preferably an American’s. And yet, as the background sets changed, these very same cafeteria managers, FedEx couriers, self-trained accountants and small-time entrepreneurs now played the knave, not so much the salt of the earth as the runoff that had poisoned it: the kind of people who’d voted, in an act of willful self-annihilation, for the incorrect president.

Diana was fairly confident her uncle hadn’t. She weighed the evidence lying in bed. He wasn’t an especially enthusiastic citizen. He tended to forget to pay his taxes (as she knew from the occasions her father had been called in to help), which of course caused trouble with the law, which in turn introduced in him certain biases against the government. So there was that issue, were he to vote. Though she wagered lack of civic interest had probably won out. Lying awake, still inappropriately naked and decidedly unaroused, she listened to the easy sounds of the storm. Envied Anand his sleep. He wrapped a leaden arm around her. It weighed heavily on her breasts. Gently, she removed it. The eaves shuddered. She stared at the ceiling fan. Ideally she’d have had the chance to prepare her uncle the way she had her parents, to coach him on those things that were and weren’t appropriate to say to someone who had grown up elsewhere and only recently become American. The whole world is a reason to worry at 4 a.m. She pushed herself up from the bed and slipped on her filthy shirt, her wrinkled linen uniform.

Half an hour later, she was at the sink in the kitchen, nursing a cup of leftover coffee she’d found languishing in the globe of the Mr. Coffee pot. The mesh of Anand’s basketball shorts breathed around her knees. His sweet voice still spun in her head – unfortunately what it sang was CCR. She watched the storm. She was about to search the cupboards for snacks or go out to the car for the rest of the chips when the side door snapped open. Her uncle entered from the garage.

There are two kinds of guests, those who naturally make themselves at home, and those perpetually ashamed creatures horrified to be caught doing anything in any room. Diana was of the latter variety, which is to say her uncle’s arrival startled her completely. He was speaking softly to a Pyrex tray of raw chicken thighs. The oven clock cast the pallid skins in a lunar glow.

Diana splashed some water at the coffee she’d spilled onto her shirt.

‘Hello?’

‘The fox . . . the fox . . .’ he said.

Diana’s father often sleepwalked. It must be hereditary. This was a tender thought. She knew just what to do. She took the tray and set it on the counter, so that her uncle’s hands now loosely gripped the air. She affirmed everything he said. ‘The fox, the fox of course, let’s get you back to bed.’ She directed him back into the hall, past all the pictures of his daughter, here posing with a papier-mâché volcano; here in the woods with her little crossbow; here on Christmas in a green velvet dress draped with a wide ribbon sash.

They were at the entrance to his bedroom when he came to. She watched him take in the time, her shorts, her soaked-through shirt.

‘That’s quite the outfit.’

‘I left my bag in Gettysburg.’

Her uncle puzzled a moment longer. She had the feeling of backing into someone else’s nightmare. Then, without warning, he threw back his head and laughed. The response was so alarming she doubted his lucidity. He wiped his eyes.

‘Oh yeah, I Left My Bag in Gettysburg, I saw that on Broadway opening night.’

How was it that she was always pegged the hysterical one? Diana returned to bed in a huff. When she woke, the sky was clear, and Anand was just stepping out of the shower, fresh back from a run.

‘Cool shorts,’ he said.

Looking down, she saw she’d fallen asleep atop the duvet in the mesh, while he had gone running in his nice cotton ones.

 

What do you do with an uncle you’ve never met? Luckily the storm had left them with several chores. Outside, driftwood was strewn over the sculpture garden. They helped to gather it, collecting the branches into neat piles. Then her uncle looked at the sky and said, ‘Screw it,’ because the next storm, signposted in the gathering clouds, would only nuke them again. They cooked the chicken legs to feed the fox who often lingered at the stream, and who was also fed handfuls of peanuts and blueberries. ‘Foxes eat this?’ Of course they did. For lunch the humans too ate chicken legs, hot and unseasoned and dripping with fat, consumed while standing up around the same glass tray. They balanced bones in fingertips. ‘Fucking delicious!’ her uncle said. It was hard not to want to tell an octogenarian to take it easy, hard not to tell him to try, at least, to be a little cautious. He’d survived the Korean War, prostate cancer, a dislocated spine. He’d fallen from the platform where he’d been sighting deer and temporarily paralyzed both legs. Could Anand or Diana have army-crawled back to the car to keep warm until the ambulance arrived? Could they have performed a deadweight pull-up from the ground to reach the driver’s seat? The uncle thought not. Anand leaned on his rake. ‘Agree to disagree.’

He and Diana looked around the yard at the sawhorse, woodshed, dirt bike, tools, the sculptures advancing between the woodpiles like opposing pieces on a chessboard. It was true they were unused to this line of work, to this part of the world. It was enough to scramble your brain. Diana paused to sniff again at the collar of her rancid shirt. With a look either conciliatory or cunning – it was hard to tell with him – her uncle turned to Anand.

‘You know what you could help me with,’ he said. And without further ado, he disappeared around the side of the house.

They found him in the garage at the workbench beside the extra oven he’d installed for cooking in bulk (for the fox?), which excluded the possibility of being able to park a car. Car or no car, he’d always lusted after one of those automatic doors. Now over eighty, he conceded, eventually his back would go, and this time not so temporarily. He held out the hardware to Anand. The box read EZ Glide!.

‘You people are all so handy with IT –’

Diana snatched at the device as if it were a grenade he was about to detonate.

‘I’ll do it, I’ll do it,’ she said.

Halfway up the ladder, electric screwdriver in hand, instruction booklet crumpled on the floor, Diana began to question her gallantry. She listened to her uncle’s welding tips filter through the kitchen door. One detected the cracking open of beers. Now he was inviting Anand to see the basement studio – ‘Where the magic happens!’ – an incantation soon followed by the heavy creak of two grown men descending wooden steps. A creeping jealousy, not entirely unfamiliar, seeped into her chest. The truth was, her family often seemed more comfortable when Anand was around. He had this effect on people. He was easily loved. Whole dinner parties courted his attention. It was obviously one of many reasons she’d fallen in love with him herself; why she was still surprised he’d fallen for her. He appeared more at ease than she was in either of their respective worlds, plus the third they shared. She envied how he drew her parents out. They glowed, flattered; the world had come to them. The initial friction overcome, these days they addressed themselves to him, not their daughter, when the four of them convened. ‘I’m sure that’s not true,’ Anand had said, a statement quickly retracted at the look of protest on her face. ‘Okay, okay, but I’m sure it’s not intentional.’ There was maybe even a mutual anthropological interest there. She couldn’t help now but resent that it was Anand down in the studio with her uncle, to whom he had encouraged her to introduce herself against her every intuition. She notched the electric screwdriver against the wooden frame of the garage and pressed with all her might. At the very least, she would figure out this fucking door. That was for sure. The drill bit sank into the wood. The lintel bracket was secured. Then the drill caught, sputtered, and crashed, ejecting the battery into the drainage grate. Diana, for her part, was left swinging from the lip of the frame, one foot on the ladder, the other flailing free. She caught her breath, her balance, briefly contemplated her uncle’s experience with paralysis. It occurred to her that she could not perform a pull-up of any kind.

Then again, she hadn’t fallen.

Steadying herself, she shifted the ladder to connect the power unit. The contraption blinked. Slowly, the door folded into itself, disgorging the heat of the stilted afternoon. In the dark, the overhead light flickered on.

She was high with success! In the way only very unhandy people are at the first sign of savoir faire. It was a rush. She was feeling, all in all, not exactly herself. Her arms ached with the effort of holding the screwdriver aloft, her heart flooded with adrenaline from her close call. She could feel the sweat and salt on the surface of her skin. And something else, beneath it. She listened to the silence of the house. Her uncle and Anand were still in the cellar. It hardly bothered her anymore.

At the sink, she wrung out her shirt, then splashed her face and underarms and glanced into the mirror. The body there was soft and fragile, completely unsuited to the capable person she suddenly felt herself to be. Oh well. Mirrors lie. Her clothes dripping from the shower rod, she planted herself before the closet doors. The handles were brass blooms, and she harvested them in her palms. Rows and rows of garments appeared, in more or less her size but in better taste. Their curator had been very careful, she realized. Diana passed an admiring hand along the hems. She’d no idea her cousin, older by seven years, or else younger by twenty-three, had cultivated such precocious style. Perhaps she could have taught Diana a thing or two. This imaginary thread cast itself into the past and immediately fell slack. She lifted the sleeve of a gingham shirtdress and let it fall. There were shoulder pads in the jackets and silk linings in the skirts. She was reminded of a novel she’d once read set in colonial Hong Kong, in which a notorious doyenne attempts to turn her school-age niece into a concubine. It’s for her own good; the niece’s prospects are grim. The girl makes her way uphill in the swampy summer, thrashing through the vegetation to the aunt’s opaline palace at the crest. In her new bedroom she opens the wardrobe to a rackful of party dresses. There are outfits for every occasion, tailored right down to her slender, still adolescent waist. Lavender sachets tucked inside each collar keep the garments fresh. Where would she ever wear them? The girl knew immediately, and in spite of her better instincts, that she’d been bought. It was too late; she was in too deep.

In the approaching mid-Atlantic storm, the room was almost tropical; there was no more use in Diana’s resisting the wardrobe. Still, something in her hesitated. She wished to ask permission. Then again, there were at least thirty dresses here. Odds were her uncle wouldn’t notice. The residue from her shower still clung to her collarbone, and the gingham checks blossomed as she slipped the shirtdress on. She cinched the waist. It was a perfect fit.

 

The cellar access was hazardously steep and led directly from the kitchen. From the oven, in fact. Opening the appliance door to check the clearance, Diana was launched onto the landing. She stood there. The men’s voices rose up to meet her. Anand was asking polite questions (How had he gotten started? What was this machine? Perhaps a demonstration?). Then, after a while, he no longer was. It was just her uncle speaking.

One did not harbor high hopes for her uncle’s studio (one had seen the lawn), but that’s not what this descent was about now, was it? She lowered herself onto the top step. He wasn’t talking about art anymore. Or maybe he was. What did she know? Her father was right. What a real bullshitter she was. She turned an ear to the cellar depths. It was the war that had risen to the surface of the conversation there, like oil on the highway after rain. Her uncle had been stationed in the trenches along the 38th Parallel. (Cartographers are the true warmongers.) His tone was distant, as if the memory were speaking of its own, disembodied accord. It wasn’t easy to describe, he said, what it was like to survive only just barely in touch with your limbs. Imagine Christmas Eve. The perspective is age eighteen. Everything sinks. Boots. The men inside of them. They disappear into the snow. The Chinese are blasting carols across no man’s land. This was the void: hearing ‘Jingle Bell Rock’ in a trench in the dead of night in a proxy war at the end of the world. Maybe it wasn’t ‘Jingle Bell Rock.’ But it should have been. Could any carol make a better weapon? The point was he needed no reminder of the reasons to fear his country. He’d seen its pulsing heart, packed in bloody snow. A note of hysteria laced his story now. He asked Anand, ‘You sing?’ He’d had his own way with music once, he said. As did every kid back then. You played the campsites until the draft letter came, then left the instrument and your old man’s disappointments behind. A shivery tremor sang out. Diana descended.

Her uncle stood beneath the basement’s single exposed bulb, holding a sonorous sheet of copper. It rang triumphant, like a gong. Anand sat on the workbench, looking as if he too had just survived a tour. He watched Diana arrive. Following his gaze, her uncle turned. Who was this apparition at the bottom of the stairs? For the first time, he struck Diana as old. She drew up a stool. Without protesting, he sat. His chin fell to his chest. She knelt to check his pulse and pupils. They were in accord. In her head, a horrid clanging chorus. She demonstrated deep breaths. ‘Come on, you too,’ she said. He patted her hands with his. It was the gesture of an elderly man. His eyes were clouded yet clear, like an early sky; soon the heat would burn away the fog. The crisis was not of medical origin, she decided, but something more obscure. ‘I’m sorry,’ she said. ‘I left –’ Yes, yes, the musical. He breathed in. It took ages. She hooked an arm under his. ‘Up, up then, let’s go upstairs.’ Again, he didn’t protest. His weight against her was totally insignificant, as if the fate of everybody were a slow evaporation; eventually, we disappear, a bit more humidity released into the air.

Anand, still listening from the workbench, heard Diana say,

‘You’ve got yourself an automatic garage door now.’

 

They got her uncle to bed. It was midafternoon, and the daylight felt foreign after the basement. They retreated into their own ersatz room, where Anand drew the curtains.

‘That was intense.’

He collapsed onto the pillows, and Diana followed suit. They lay side by side in the restrained sun. Diana’s legs were folded, uncouthly froglike, under the hem of her dress.

‘Did you know any of that?’

She didn’t respond. He kissed her. Pressing himself into her, he felt the new sharpness of her bones and wondered when it was she’d lost so much weight. How rudely people change. Though she pulled him close, touching him the way he liked, something stayed stiff and unyielding inside the gingham. He had a hand in the skirt, exploring essences, before he too gave up. The entire affair felt wrong for reasons that were vague on the whole but intuitive in the particulars. ‘These fucking pillows.’ He tossed one to the floor and put his warm hands to his ribs. ‘I feel a little sick.’ Diana smoothed his face. Stroked his sweaty temples.

‘Come on,’ she said. ‘You haven’t seen the garage yet.’

 

They stood barefoot on the cool cement, watching the door unfold itself again and again, a gigantic lolling tongue. ‘You did good.’ ‘I know!’ She punched the remote and the garage growled to a tight-lipped state. They watched it open and close, open and close. The mechanics left them hungry. They went out to feed the fox, then themselves. From the kitchen window, they watched the vixen nudge the bowl they’d left by the overflowing stream, all the while shoveling handfuls of blueberries and peanuts into their own mouths. ‘I could live like this,’ she said. ‘I’m starving,’ said Anand. They were two children who’ve stumbled on an abandoned house in the woods, eager to see what the owners have left behind. A box of pasta, a can of tomatoes. Onions and garlic sprouted behind the pantry door.

The radio switched on, announcing her uncle’s return. He emerged from the bedroom with boom- and pillbox tucked under his arm. In the kitchen, he slipped a CD into the plate, then counted out a permutation of pale capsules and washed them down. There were good days and bad days, he explained, and many in between. The wind picked up. The storm unfurled luxuriously, like a dark sheet of crushed silk. The table crowded with heaping bowls of pasta and rows of votive candles. Anand sat across from Diana. She flickered in the candlelight, still in her gingham dress. The music was far too loud for conversation, you could hardly hear the wind. When the power went out, the world plunged into a 24-karat darkness. The battery-powered Beach Boys clanged on. Something of that bandstand genius, Anand thought, echoed in every American song. Diana’s uncle asked for bread. The gingham strained horribly against her breasts as she passed it to him – she was a woman, this was a child’s garment. The exchange precipitated a housewife’s loving look. Anand dropped his eyes.

The car keys were in his pocket, and he registered their weight as the chorus spun around once more. Here was the music, the storm, the inertia, the heat, the awful commotion of a single discography set eternally on repeat. Kilometers of highway stretched ahead. But it was far too late; he was in too deep."

    "author": "Wang Zhanhei",
    "date": "2024",
    "url": "https://granta.com/goodbye-bridge-of-the-east",
    "text": "Imight be mistaken, but I think that in all my years of dating, Wu Jiayu was the very first repeat customer.

By the time my zodiac year swung around for the third time, my ma and various aunties had all but given up on me. Only Auntie Mei, whose matchmaking powers were renowned throughout the neighbourhood, persevered. She saw me as a blemish on her otherwise pristine record. Still, she wasn’t exactly giving me much to work with: the decline in the quality of dates was evident. Ma was unimpressed. ‘No one’s forcing Auntie Mei to help,’ she said. ‘Why even bother if she’s going to bring us matches like that?’ She didn’t acknowledge that even those matches were unwilling to meet me for a second date.

‘This one is a bank teller,’ said Auntie Mei. ‘A bank teller,’ Ma sneered. ‘What prospects does a bank teller have? Slave away for a decade and you still don’t get anywhere.’ She turned to me. ‘Still, she’s about a billion times better off than you.’ For all her bluster, Ma still pulled out some cash and told me to take this one seriously, to try not to screw it up.

Taking Auntie Mei’s advice, we chose Zikawei, neutral territory, halfway between Jinyang and Xingzhuang. When we met, I learned that Wu Jiayu had left her job at the bank. She described her current work as ‘flexible’. I said mine was too. Actually, she said, she was an influencer – apparently not keen to share the same category as me. She didn’t specify what exactly her area of influence might be.

We met at a conveyor-belt sushi place – her choice. It was a new restaurant that was meant to be fun, full of chattering schoolkids. Every five plates earned you a chance to win a capsule toy from the vending machine. We were unlucky: we tried five times and didn’t win anything. This didn’t stop Wu Jiayu from taking a flurry of photos of the machine and of the little train that delivered the food. Then she busied herself with her phone.

‘So, you’re a food influencer?’ I asked. ‘It’s best not to limit yourself to one niche,’ she said. She showed me her home page on Xiaohongshu, which featured various popular locations. Most of her posts had likes in the single digits, except for one about a Western restaurant that had over a hundred – she had pinned that one to the top. ‘I’m just getting started,’ she said defensively. ‘Soon, they’ll all be super popular.’

The photos had about a 65 per cent resemblance to how she looked in person. In the photos, she could have been fresh out of university. In real life, she wore thick make-up, especially on her nose, which had a shiny patch like the Golden-Horned King in Journey to the West. I wondered what resemblance to the photos would be left minus the make-up.

But all I dared say was, ‘That’s great.’

The meal went reasonably well, mostly thanks to Wu Jiayu. She was a good talker, and it didn’t feel like she was talking just to fill awkward silence. She was comfortable talking about herself, and didn’t seem to care much what others thought of her. And she stayed clear of the standard questions you hear on an arranged date. It was clear she was also there to fulfil a family obligation. After we finished eating, she went to the bathroom and took her bag with her. I almost fell asleep waiting for her to come back and started to wonder if she had taken the subway home. Eventually she returned and took a neat little camera from her bag. ‘Are you up for helping me take a few pictures?’ she said.

I went with Wu Jiayu to the new Zikawei Library and took a few photos according to her instructions. Actually, it was more like several hundred, because we were there all afternoon. I didn’t have time to check the quality of the images. I didn’t even see the finished product on Xiaohongshu – mainly because later I couldn’t remember the long string of characters that made up her username.

I didn’t think too much of this. On previous arranged dates, I had helped move furniture or gone to pick up someone’s kids. So, when we parted at the subway station, I assumed that she would become yet another zombie lurking in the depths of my phone contacts.

A week later, to my great surprise, the zombie came back to life and asked if I was free the next day. We started meeting once a week.

Ma was both delighted and annoyed that I was staying out so long. She vented to Auntie Mei, who explained that Wu Jiayu and I were clearly sleeping together. She had seen it many a time, she said: couples who could not come to a suitable agreement and ended up becoming friends with benefits instead. Ma flew into a rage and announced that she was going to stop paying my expenses. This didn’t bother me – Wu Jiayu always reminded me to eat before we met anyway.

To make sure she was looking her best in the photos, Wu Jiayu avoided eating during our dates, and she didn’t order anything for me when we were done. We went to Dishui Lake, Home Expo, and to every road in town decorated with unseasonal flowers – places I had never been before. She wore a different fancy outfit each time: a qipao, a Japanese sailor dress, the flared trousers and tight top popular with millennials. I didn’t know if she was a hit on Xiaohongshu, but I figured she must have been reasonably satisfied with the pictures I took of her on our first date at Zikawei.

Wu Jiayu sent me the location of a place called B-Link. I looked it up: it was just across the Huangpu River, an easy trip on the Shenchuan Special Line. We agreed to meet in the evening to avoid the heat, with the usual condition that food would not be included.

She arrived before me. This was unusual. Normally she was at least ten minutes late, and would then spend another ten minutes applying her make-up in the bathroom. This gave me a chance to grab a bowl of wonton or some rice from a street vendor. This time, her outfit was retro: the sort of tracksuit students wore to school in the eighties and nineties, her hair in pigtails, a satchel over her shoulder. The thin white stripes on the sleeves and trouser legs made Wu Jiayu look thinner than usual, and she was wearing less make-up, though the shiny patch on her nose still gleamed in the light of the setting sun.

The ‘B-Link’ was a converted factory in the industrial district, and it still retained something of its original Soviet-style design. Wu Jiayu stood at the far end of a red-brick wall, looking out at a vast construction site, all neat lines, sharp angles, and overlapping layers. I wasn’t sure if she was looking at the construction or the clouds above, or perhaps just contemplating her next pose.

I walked over. ‘Which floor would you choose to live on?’ she asked.

Near where she was pointing, a large construction machine moved up and down, sliding like the glass elevators you see on the outside of shopping malls. I didn’t say anything. I was thinking about how furious Ma would be if our apartment complex once again failed to pass the referendum on installing an elevator.

‘I’ve already decided,’ said Wu Jiayu. ‘I’d live on the top floor, with the views. Closest to the Yangpu Bridge, furthest from all the bad smells of the Yangshupu River.’ The way she said it made it sound like she’d already acquired the deeds, like a price in the tens of millions was no obstacle.

We stood together for a while, until she came out of her reverie and produced her camera. We took pictures against the wall, on the lawn, and then at the designated photo spot between the two buildings, where a giant red balloon was emblazoned with the words i love b-link. Finally we took a photo at the faux street sign that said, i’m thinking of you in . . . [insert location here]. Wu Jiayu had a standard pose for these sorts of signs: she stood to the left, bent over at a right angle and leaned forward to show one side of her face. I used her favoured ratio: she took up two-thirds of the photo, the other third was scenery. Through the viewfinder, her face and the plaza behind her were tinged red like the clouds.

At one point, Wu Jiayu discovered a zebra crossing with a McDonald’s logo and immediately sat down on the M, with a pout and a V-sign. I reacted quickly, taking a few shots standing up, then a few bending down, but none of them were satisfactory. In the end, she sent me up onto the roof to take some photos from above. I didn’t have an entry card to get into the elevator of the office building, so I went through the fire exit. After a few minutes climbing up the steps, I experienced a moment of sudden uncertainty: while Wu Jiayu was pursuing fame and profit, what was I hoping to find by following her all over town? Sixty stairs and five floors later, I had come up with a couple of answers. First, it forced me out of the house, something I hadn’t done much since losing my job – in other words, a form of exercise. Second, it kept me away from Ma, with whom I had no major conflicts but still preferred to avoid. So, while you couldn’t really say that this was a meaningful use of my time, it wasn’t completely meaningless either. Maintaining a weekly habit was progress of a sort. Did this mean I could learn how to live a life of routine again, perhaps even try to return to work? Realising I was walking through an office area made me afraid to continue this line of thought. Fortunately, by this point I had arrived on the roof.

Wu Jiayu didn’t provide me with any direct instructions. Now that we had collaborated on several occasions, she seemed to trust me enough to simply sit down in the middle of the zebra crossing, exuding confidence, ignoring any side-eyes she received from passers-by. Every few seconds she switched to a new pose, positions she had clearly planned while waiting for me to climb several dozen metres above her. At this point, a third answer occurred: perhaps something deeper could develop between me and Wu Jiayu. The problem was that, like me, she was thirty-six and still living with her mother, which placed her on the lowest rung in the arranged dating marketplace. The only way out was to climb up a level, but unfortunately everyone, at every level, had the same idea. But perhaps we could find some other way out, as we were doing now, existing together somewhere beyond the family, outside the home.

Wu Jiayu stood up and dusted off her trousers, which meant I could come back down. As we wandered over to the other side of the park, we saw nearby residents out for a stroll, fans in hand, or jogging, or chatting loudly in one of the office workers’ designated smoking areas. A few were walking their dogs on the lawn that you weren’t supposed to walk on. We took a few more photos against this background. I knew for a fact that Wu Jiayu looked better in those pictures taken from a distance, but I wasn’t going to tell her that. Before long, it got dark; the lawn turned from green to black, then orange under the light of the construction site opposite.

Wu Jiayu pointed to a light in the distance. Come on, she said, let’s go over there.

We cycled away from B-Link and followed a road that ran alongside the construction site, until we arrived at Changyang Road. I realised with a jolt that I had once interned at a start-up along that road, more than a decade ago now. I wasn’t sure if the company was still there. Back then, I would take the ferry across the river in the evening and walk around for miles before setting off for home. A decade on, neither memory nor reality could really be depended upon. It was probably right ahead, visible if only we continued a bit further down the road. For a strange moment I had the sensation that I was cycling back through time; then Wu Jiayu darted off into an alley, and I had to turn back and follow her. The construction site loomed again. The abrasions of the rainy season had marked the surface of the building, and in the dim evening light it was hard to tell if it was brand new or a decaying shell on the point of collapse.

It was clearly not the first time that Wu Jiayu had cycled to the temporary accommodation building. She stepped confidently past the workers, who gave us curious glances, and towards a thicket of trees beyond. A set of stairs ran down to a riverside path. Everything was finished, neat, smooth, well proportioned, and the warm stench no longer wafted from the Yangshupu River. Downriver, the red pylons of the distant Yangpu Bridge were like two sticks of incense, glowing at each tip, illuminating everything that could see them and everything that could not.

As we walked north along the river, passing stray cats, night-time runners, fishermen with torchlights and gossiping old ladies, Wu Jiayu kept her camera in her bag. When we reached a crossroads, she stopped. On the stone bridge leading to the opposite bank, two panels of rusted sheet metal barred the way to the construction site ahead.

When I followed Wu Jiayu’s gaze, I realised that we had come to the other side of the construction site, the part we had been looking out over before – our path had taken us in a U-shaped loop. Sparks were cast down from a crane up above us, glittering waves that tumbled to the darkened ground.

Wu Jiayu pointed to the only tree on the other side of the river. ‘That’s the exact height of the third floor,’ she said.

She was standing right in front of the metal barrier, looking towards the tree. There was still no camera. In her vintage tracksuit she could have been an actor, or a time traveller from the past. What she said next only reinforced that impression.

The kitchen faced south. When they took out the extractor fan, the soot made the cat’s face even darker. After the typhoon passed, the roof was carpeted with treasure. Pairs of shorts, even some banknotes. Two generations, three. More people, less space. Grandma called, told me to go out into the street and join the demonstration, to help drum up support and carry one of those red banners that said ‘I want relocation’. But the police were already there when I arrived. Five years later, when the relocation finally happened, they really did bring out the drums for the celebrations. Shame my dad wasn’t around to hear them. Me and mum didn’t see any of that government money.

With a wave of her hand, Wu Jiayu traced the edge of the building. ‘Look, these were the Shenxin workers’ quarters, and this was Xifangziqiao, and next to it . . .’

I no longer felt like I was just there to take photographs or provide her with a service. Now our relationship felt more like that of host and guest. But again, I had the vague sense that I had been here before.

Xifangzhiqiao – Bridge of the West. And next to that, was it Dongfangzhiqiao? I asked. Bridge of the East?

Not zhiqiao, she corrected me, ziqiao. The zi of child, or banknote.

When I was an intern, I used to go for walks after work to avoid the evening rush. Some of the buildings had been demolished, others had been emptied out, leaving nothing but concrete husks. After nine o’clock, legs emerged from the cracks in those empty buildings – slender ones, fleshy ones, all lined up against the wall. They smoked, chatted to each other, chatted to passers-by, and their words brought a chill to the evening breeze. I kept my gaze low, listening to the conversations, the accents, never daring to look up. I remember a pair of mauve tights that stood out from the row of black and fishnet; they made the legs look fuller, curved like an aubergine. At that moment, the mauve tights stepped forwards, and a hand reached out to cover my trouser pocket, pressing down hard just as a motorbike roared past. When I came to my senses, the hand was gone, and my phone was still in my pocket. I gave a nod of thanks.

‘Five hundred,’ said mauve tights. ‘What do you say?’

I didn’t answer.

‘I bet your phone cost quite a bit,’ she said.

That Motorola had cost me 1,500 yuan, and she had helped me keep it. So I figured I was saving money, even if I did pay her. We agreed on 300, and I went with her. The way was long and winding – amber street lights, black roads, mauve tights. We finally arrived at a row of cramped slum housing. A single room, no light, no fan, only a cool breeze blowing in off the river carrying a foul smell. In the dark, her body was plumper than it had seemed outside, but surprisingly nimble. Perhaps she was just trying to get it done quickly. She didn’t walk me back when we were done. In something of a trance, I wandered for a long time, unable to find my way out of the maze. When, at last, I ended up back where I started, I saw her climbing onto the back of a motorbike. The bike carried mauve tights away, probably back to their original position, their original set-up, like a game restarting, ready for the next passer-by. Following the fumes of the motorbike, I rushed out of the maze, pausing at the metal gate to glance up at the street sign, the end point of the game: dongfangzhiqiao, the bridge of the east. The world of Shanghai, ‘the Pearl of the East’, felt very far removed from
that place.

Now, many years later, the riddle was solved. It wasn’t ‘Dongfang-zhiqiao’ but ‘Dong-Fangziqiao’: it was bordered by the river, and divided into an east, Dong-Fangziqiao, and a west, Xi-Fangziqiao. I must have misread that one character on the sign, or misremembered. Not that it mattered, because now everything would be new, and this place could be named anything. They could come up with some kind of justification for any old name – just look at the meaningless wording on the advert above the construction site: brilliant riverside, where past and future converge. I had no choice but to believe it.

Wu Jiayu and I walked a long way along the Yangshupu River that evening. Each time the two incense sticks of the Yangpu Bridge loomed up before us, she turned around and we doubled back, like two fish trapped in a weir. When we were tired from all the walking, Wu Jiayu suggested we sit down by some outdoor fitness equipment. She looked through the photos, enlarging each one, as if checking for a particular element. She didn’t speak for a while – she never felt the need to fill silences. Though the length of this particular silence made me wonder if I should leave her to it. When she did finish, she stood up, dusted herself off, and said, ‘Let’s go back.’ Standard procedure: we each rented a share-bike, and set off towards the subway station that offered the most convenient route home.

At the Jiangpu Park intersection, I watched her lock the bike and head into the station. She disappeared down one hole, and then reappeared from another, a dozen metres away, just a few seconds later.

‘Wait, are you up for helping me take a few pictures down by the river?’ she called, with the exact same tone as when she first asked me.

Perhaps because of that night’s episode, I decided to take the ferry home when we were done with the photos. The evening air was cool, and the reflections gleamed in the water – neither the air nor the water had changed with the years.

Ma was not pleased. She followed me to my room and demanded that I tell her exactly where I stood with Wu Jiayu. Since she wasn’t leaving, I decided to provoke her. ‘We’re discussing living arrangements,’ I told her. ‘What are you talking about?’ she said, alarmed. ‘Does this mean you’re paying for a house, or she is?’ ‘It’s an old house we’ve been discussing,’ I said. ‘One that’s already been knocked down.’ A sigh of relief. ‘Oh, so she took you back to the place where she grew up – does that mean you’re serious?’ I picked up my towel and went into the bathroom without replying.

I came out of the shower to a message from Wu Jiayu, forwarded from her Xiaohongshu account. It was the last picture we had taken that night: her and the Yangpu Bridge, composed as she’d instructed. She was a small figure, lit from behind, her face indistinct. In the background, the two incense sticks of the bridge, crimson, solemn, indifferent to the blazing headlights that moved between them. The second image was a copy of an old photo. A small figure, lit from behind so her face was indistinct, the pylons of the bridge – still under construction – rising behind her. The surface of the river was calm, and the sky was broad. In the bottom-right corner, red numbers: 1992.8. It was that same summer.

It was a new post, not yet attracting any interest, but pinned to the top of her profile. The title was ‘Me and Me’.

Without hesitation, I pressed the red heart. Now I had her username, I spent several hours going through every single one of her posts, including the ones that featured my photography, and though none of them really captured what she looked like in real life, I gave each one a red heart.

Before I went to sleep, I wrote out a new message. Where are you going next weekend?

As I hit send, it felt like I had left my room behind and was standing with Wu Jiayu, together in the midnight street.

    "text": "I’ve never worked in this flat. I’ve done the dishes – there is no dishwasher or freezer, but there is a compact fridge, which I’ve heard groaning when the night is thin and I can’t sleep and Leo sleeps – and I’ve done the washing. I’ve scrubbed down the walls of the white-tiled bathroom, which some would say looks like the lavatory of a psychiatric hospital, but I quite like it. Though work-work – I’ve never once sat down to do that here.

I think a lot about my acts around the house. If I do the dishes, does it mean I am starting a pattern that will be hard to break later? If I do the shopping, will that be mine to do next week and the week after that? People don’t talk about these things when they move in together. We haven’t. They – meaning we – just do things as they come. Colette once said the most important thing in a relationship is to have good manners and to treat each other as though you don’t live together.

We wake up. Leo makes coffee on the stove. We drink it in the front room by the large open window that is also a door, so that we’re inside and outside at the same time. It’s warm enough for that, but only just. Then Leo starts working at the dining table that overlooks the terrace, though he sits facing the wall. I wouldn’t do that if I were working. I would face the swaying tops of the trees visible through a narrow interstice in the concrete wall. You can’t see the water below from there, but something about the manner of the trees gives it away. I think Leo could work facing anything: work is a switch he turns on, which has sometimes seemed to me threatening. He can work there, face against the wall, for five hours straight. He hardly moves. We break for lunch if I’m there, and usually I am, and then he continues until the evening, at which point I will have done the shopping.

 

–

 

Leo’s being here means many things to me, and one of them is that I want to fuck during the day. This is not a system I can impose. In the face of Leo’s concentration, my time, whether spent idling on the sofa or not, feels stolen. The thing is – or another thing is – that if I were to sit down and work here at the dining table beside Leo, we’d be facing each other. That’s not a way I can work. I could go to the library, hauling all my things there and back, but I did that for years. I can’t muster even the idea of it. I lie down on the floor. I stand back up, looking out the interstice in the wall. I go stand in the kitchen. Everything has been cleaned already; there is nothing to clean here. Leo is a messy chef. He cuts vegetables in a way that, if they’re peppers, pips are strewn all over the place, and if they’re tomatoes, juice bleeds thin and coagulated down the counter.

For a moment I’m happy that he’s not here today but away at some conference in Liverpool. The boy, though, is here. I look at him across the room, the top of his head is visible over the back of the sofa. From here it could be a grown person’s head, though he’s only three. The boy likes looking through the interstice too. Sometimes a heron passes, seen as through a pair of rectangular binoculars. I think of the time I saw a hammer lying by the coffee machine in my mum’s kitchen, and all the daycare children were sitting with their soft skulls eating cut fruit from little flower plates. I wonder when skulls reach their full size, and just then the boy turns as though registering the discomfort of my thinking.

 

the boy: Where’s daddy?

me: At the conference, remember?

the boy: Right.

me: But that’s okay. We can take the train just fine on our own, can’t we?

 

He’s looking at me directly now, his eyes a colour I can’t name. I feel a blend of care and worry swell in my chest. I think of soil and cut straw. I swallow. The boy directs his eyes at the interstice again. I wonder what he will look like when he’s five, ten, twenty.

 

me: Do you like the flat?

 

I regret the question immediately. The boy turns his head and looks at me. I look at the boy. We blink.

 

the boy: I like the windows that are also doors.

 

This pleases me.

On the platform the boy’s hand is warm in mine, a little clammy. He goes in front and picks two seats by the window. He knows his way around the carriage, or carriages like it. I sit down across from him and watch him watching trees flick past. His eyes are lighter than his father’s, the pupils noticeably small. They dart from point to point. I don’t want him to feel observed – I look away.

How can we be equals, I think. How can I be older, earn his respect, but also have him not loathe me. I wonder if he’s hungry, but perhaps by not asking he will see me as more of an equal. Would he tell me if he were, hungry? I have a banana in my bag, but thinking about it makes me feel guilty, like I’m treating the child as an animal. A feeling of abandonment rushes through me. How could Leo have me take this trip on my own when it’s the first time I go there? Is everything you do in a child’s life about reacting, solving sudden logistical hurdles in sequence? The boy sneezes, surprising himself. He smiles at me, watery eyes. He has one crooked tooth in front of the other like a toe poking out of a sock.

He walks ahead on a gravel path that turns into pavement. There aren’t any birds in the trees, which have dark brown leaves, unseasonably still attached. The boy pretend-whistles. I can’t whistle either and I think that I love him. Will this feeling fester? I wonder. He stops in front of the door of number six, whose number – font, size, placement – suggests precisely door number 6, like in some game show. Did I not dream this once, walking a tapering path with a small boy, opening doors?

I feel my stomach turn, picturing a leaden figure inside, rows of family and individual portraits on walls, contemptible flowery dresses and chins on folded hands. With his hand already pressed to the door, which has neither knob nor handle, the boy peers over his shoulder at me, his flat palm seemingly saying: help, I can’t get in. He looks at me. I signal for him to wait, I don’t know how, but it works. I think of trees communicating below ground through spidery strings.

The boy waits, nothing on him budges, the hand placed flat against door number six says: this is the door I want. Some people have a calm about them. Do I? Probably not these days, an edge of tension comes with not working, a certain lethargy. I walk up near the boy. Be the one who knows, I think, or at least the one who is calm about not knowing. I knock on the door. For a moment nothing, but a thick nothing. Then a soft rustling, like a chiffon shawl being pulled through a keyhole. The boy removes his hand from the door and folds it into mine. It’s warm, small, a little clammy still. Is he taking care of me, or is he nervous? We wait. The knocks have activated movement inside, which we listen to.

The woman has put out biscuits that I’m trying not to judge. Who would buy these dry, flavourless lumps of flour and oil, I think, and I think of my grandmother, who might have when she was alive. I think of death. The air in the place is dense and I think that sitting down was a mistake. Did I ask if I could, or did she direct me to this seat. I already can’t remember. There’s a lot of saliva in my mouth. My hands feel like dry, itchy gloves. My eyes are dry too, and when I blink they smudge up. I know her nails from photos. They’re long and ladylike, the kind that would try to scratch a sticker off the back of a CD case. I take some pride in my lack of ladylikeness. It’s a thick felt vest I can put on. Wearing dresses makes me feel like a woman, which I am, but I prefer not to think about that whenever I move my legs. To have long nails . . .

The boy sips his lemonade or whatever she’s poured in his little plastic cup. From the wet look in his eyes it’s something fizzy. My tendency to judge is something that’s developed out of an aversion to my own childhood, or the middle part, the beginning was good. We lived by a lake then and had a nanny, it was my brief Fleur Jaeggy period. It meant my parents were earning money and wanted us in or near the house rather than sending us off to state-run institutions, the worst in the country, that would later break us. You can be such a snob, Leo told me once. This did not hurt me, because I knew it’s not my soul that is. It’s much more surface level than that, more recent.

She hasn’t looked at me yet, and by not looking she’s looking piercingly. I let her not look which means not looking at her either. It’s difficult to keep finding new places to rest my eyes. I don’t want to look at what’s on the walls. I want to not know. I want to not see the wiry lamp in the ceiling that casts a web-like reflection on the table between us, but now I’ve seen it. I want to not see the cumbersome piece of Edwardian furniture behind her with a fruit bowl holding just one blighted orange, but now I’ve seen it. I want to not see the long, painted fingernails tuck a tuft of hair behind a fleshy ear. Is anyone going to speak? I think. I look at the boy, who is in his childhood home. I look to my right at the garden door. I think of a board with many latches, unilateral latches, which my brother made for his son because he loves latches, opening things, turning keys inside locks, clasping. This is what some fathers do for their sons. The boy looks at me, as if to ask what I’m doing here, but then speaks:

 

the boy: The sideways door in Mara’s flat is a window.

the fingernailed woman: –

me: –

the fingernailed woman: Biscuit?

 

I remember that I love him. We are something too – it’s lesser, but we are it. The woman hands me the plate of biscuits; this is her power. The boy crawls down from his stool and walks over to me. He takes a biscuit, puts the plate on the table where it was. I look at the woman for the first time, worried about the boy’s gesture. Then he crawls onto my thighs, something he’s never done before – we’ve been so separate in the flat.

 

the boy: Here.

me: –

the fingernailed woman: –

the boy: (to convince me) They’re good.

 

It would be mean not to touch him. Sitting there with a baby animal on my lap. I put a hand on his side not to support him in his seat so much as to indicate to him that there is support there if he needs it. Her eyes are on us. Now it looks like we’re this intimate all the time, which we’re not, have never been. Maybe it was the train journey. Maybe it’s the look on my face. What do I look like? Something smells like basement. It’s the house. I stroke the boy’s hair with a flat hand, the way you feed a horse.

Women with long fingernails want children before thirty-five, I think. Women with short fingernails don’t know. They’ve had a sustained tomboy period as children that they never grew out of and which gradually took the shape of a suspicion about motherhood and even coupledom. Women with long fingernails like flowery dresses; women with short fingernails dress monochrome. Women with long fingernails don’t want anal. Women with short fingernails like it when men come on their backs. Women with short fingernails have seen the scared eyes of men when they come, seen in their eyes, the moment they do, flashing images of their future children walking down corridors. I blink hard to stop my thoughts. The boy is on me. I look at her looking at the boy, I no longer care where she looks. His little cup is empty; he’s holding it upside down above his face to catch a final drop. She picks up her phone – the case shows a floral painting, a Monet or something stupid like that, probably bought in the V & A.

On the way back I take the seat facing away from the direction of travel, though I know it will make me a bit sick. The flat is dark and the skylight in the kitchen is dark. I will never work in this flat, I can see that now. No word from Leo since he messaged asking if his red notebook was on the desk. It wasn’t. I’ve only ever seen him with blue notebooks, always the same kind. Am I supposed to see that as a seed he’s planting, wanting to plant concern about some notebook, in me? I turn on the faucet. I drink from it. I look at the water. I turn it off. I go and sit on the dining table, because I can. I turn on the TV. Hanif Kureishi is saying that liberalism is not strong enough to handle powerful individuals who truly want something. I turn off the TV. I go and lie on the bed. I sit up and look out at the lamps of the opposing building that glow in the windows like blurred traffic lights.

The building is loud in my head, maybe it’s the silence, the gurgling pipes and even the carpet. I think of the tank above my head that holds the tub water. I was told when moving in that you shouldn’t drink from the sink in the bathroom as the water comes directly from the tank. Did I one night climb a four-rung steel ladder to see the tank for myself, or did I dream it? I stand up. I go to the sitting room to throw my phone at the sofa. I lie down where it lands, remove it from beneath me, hold it near my heart.

When I open my eyes the phone is pinging on the floor. There’s a text from the fingernailed woman. Can I pick up the boy from nursery today? He is ill. Leo is not picking up his phone, and she’s just about to chair a meeting. I text her yes. She tells me where to find the spare key. I leave the flat. I don’t shower.

 

–

 

The boy is standing outside the nursery in the pouring rain. There is a nursery worker by his side. I don’t know what to call her – where I’m from pedagogue is the word, but I think that’s derogatory in this country.

 

the boy: You’re late.

me: I’m here now.

the boy: Where are we going?

me: To the flat, I thought. Or where do you want to go?

 

We go to the station. It’s local in the way of bus stations. Something about ratios and colours of cladding. We board a train. We share yesterday’s banana. Still no word from Leo. The only voice answering me here is the boy. He lifts his chin about two finger widths to look at something out the window. I eat my share of the fruit in silence.

At Kings Cross, we exit the train and board another. The train stops too many times. The boy draws. It is important to not merely be absorbed into his life, that wouldn’t be right. The landscape changes. I grew up in a country with no mountains, this is a lot for me. My stomach responds in a way that feels like hunger but more of a stabbing. The train doors swoosh open. Empty purple platform. Dusk. I sit facing the swaying tops of trees that are visible through the narrowing space between the doors. Is there a lake nearby? I hear the boy swallow. Our heads lean against the window.

    "text": "My mother was always encouraging me to take up a sport, something I could do in my spare time that would be good for my health. It was a chance to get a bit sweaty, she said, to relieve some stress, and if I learned a sport now I’d have a skill for life. Why not give it a go? After thinking it over, I decided swimming might be fun. I imagined myself gliding through the water like a turtle, stopping to float whenever I wanted. And I thought that girls’ faces looked so lovely and white in blue water.

There weren’t many swimming pools in the city when I was in primary school. Aside from the enormous pool at the Workers’ Cultural Palace, I knew of only one other. It was just across the road from where we lived, down a narrow alley busy with tricycle trucks and opposite a school for children with special needs. The sign outside said swimming pool, but if you gave a driver the address, you had to say ‘Hai Shan Bath House’, because people mostly went there to bathe or shower. Swimming was quite expensive whereas a body scrub was more affordable. We lived in an old building, which was hard to keep warm, and in the winter, it was a hassle for the three of us to take showers. The shower attachment was a late addition, which meant you had to hold it up the entire time, and since neither the water nor the room were heated, whenever you took a shower, you risked catching a cold. My father would have sooner died than go to the public baths – he was too shy to take his clothes off in public – so I started going with my mother. It was less stressful that way. And naturally, we went to Hai Shan Swimming Pool.

The second time we went, the woman at the front desk talked my mother into buying more than just a shower. You’d be better off with an all-inclusive ticket. It covers everything: shower, scrub and swim. It’s much better value. She glanced down at me. Looks like your daughter could use some swimming lessons. I’m not sure what she saw in me. I was more tanned back then; perhaps she meant I should spend more time in the water.

My mother and I were very excited. We went straight to Bai Hua Yuan, a little wholesale market around the corner, and bought two swimming costumes, two pairs of goggles, and a swimming float for me. The seller there was persuasive too. If you buy an inflatable ring, she’ll never learn to swim! He turned to me. Here, take this. I took the swimming float. You have to stretch out your legs and kick them up and down like this. He threw away the snack he was holding, malatang in a plastic bag, to show me what to do. When you get in the water, hold it like this. Imagine you’re in trouble, and this float is a piece of decking that’s fallen off a boat. My mother had no time for this, but I got really into it, listening closely as he continued, his voice getting louder and louder. Imagine there’s a shark chasing you and a big wave right behind. You can see the beach just ahead. You hold on tight, and go for it. When you hit the shore, lie down on the float like this, like it’s a mattress . . . My mother cut in. I’ll give you ten yuan tops, and that’s it. And just like that, he turned away, and I never got to hear the end of the story.

When we got home, I pestered my mother. When can we go swimming? At first it looked promising. I’ll take you tomorrow after work, she said. But the next day, she didn’t come home after work. There was a drinks party, and then another one the next day, and the day after that. When she did come home, late at night, bleary-eyed and muddled, she stamped loudly in the corridor to activate the light and banged on the door with the heel of her shoe. My dad just accepted it, but I was furious. She saw the swimming float on the bed in my room and lay down on it, mumbling. Where are you? Come and sit next to your mum. I asked why she’d taken her shoes off. She said she’d cut her foot on the way home. There was broken glass on the ground. I didn’t see it. I moved closer and looked at her right foot. There was a bright red gash near her big toe. Without a word, my father went to fetch some sterilising wipes. When he returned, I stood before them with my head down, clenched my fists, and prepared what I was going to say. I took a deep breath and pushed my shoulders back. My mother finally noticed me. Oh, I’m lying on your float. I stared at her. When are we going swimming? Tell me exactly which day. She grinned. It’s up to you. I took another deep breath. Tomorrow. You won’t be working. It’s a Saturday.

My parents looked at each other. I’ve cut my foot, my mother said. I won’t be able to go in the water. I stood my ground. Two days ago, your foot was fine. Yesterday, your foot was fine. I think you did this on purpose. My father stayed quiet, just watching. In the silence that followed, reason slowly sided with my mother: she had an injury, even taking a shower would be difficult; several hours soaking in a pool full of disinfectant was out of the question. But at the time, I was indignant. Let your father take you, she suggested. He refused immediately – it would mean baring his pale upper arms. I didn’t want that either. I hung my head again, and as planned began to cry. It worked. My mother must still have been drunk, or else she would never have promised. When my mother drank, we were equals. Even so, she seemed reluctant. She grasped my hands and tried to make me touch her foot, but I pulled away. She sighed. Do we really have to go?

My father said she spoiled me, but it wasn’t like he was going to do anything about it. For him, Saturday was set in stone: it was his gaming day, spent, from breakfast until dinner, in front of the computer. The next day, my mother, having promised to take me swimming, wrapped a piece of plastic around her toe, and secured it with a rubber band. We crossed the road with our new kit and walked into Hai Shan Swimming Pool. Although, as I said, I’d been there twice before, both times it was just to the showers. I’d never been further. Today I was going all the way inside. In the changing room, putting on my swimming costume, I felt a cut above everyone else. I treated the brand new swimming costume like I used to treat my ballet leotard when I was younger. I took it out of the locker and put it on slowly. A little girl watched me very intently and asked her mother what I was wearing and why. The swimming costume was dark blue, with a little skirt and a yellow duck on the front. It was a bit big for me, and the straps kept slipping off my shoulders, so I had to straighten up and walk with the posture of a ballet dancer, wearing the matching dark-blue swimming cap that showed off my big forehead. Meanwhile, my mother attended to her toe: the elastic band was too tight and blood wasn’t getting to the toe, which was beginning to go white.

We walked past the steaming showers, through the huge relaxation hall with the lights switched off, and all the way down a long, narrow corridor towards a light at the far end. A middle-aged woman in short sleeves and shorts sat on a stool checking tickets. She checked our wristbands. Go through the foot pool. The swimming pool is just around the corner. There aren’t many swimmers today. I nodded blankly. My feet finally came out of the slippers and the feeling when they touched the white tiles was exhilarating. My mother went first and paddled through the ankle-deep footbath of disinfectant. As I held her arm in support, I noticed some water slip inside the plastic around her toe. The middle-aged woman had sharp eyes. What’s the matter? Something wrong with your foot? My mother had been waiting for someone to ask so she could embarrass me. I went red as she explained. Well, you’re here now, the middle-aged woman said. Might as well let her do what she wants! I reasoned that if no one came to swim, the woman would have nothing to show for having sat there all day. She waved us past and my mother led me around the corner. A bright blue world came into view. The water was calm.

Holding the float, I stepped onto the ladder and climbed down into the water. My mother had gone first and was waiting for me. I managed to get into the pool, but as soon as she let go of me, I started screaming. At the time I was about 1.3 metres tall, and even on tiptoes I could only just keep my head above water; the moment my feet were flat on the floor, water went up my nose, in my ears, gushing at me from every direction. The float was no use at all. My mother hauled me up a few times and I hung from her body like a sloth from a tree, cold and frightened. When I gazed over at the deep end, the pool seemed to go on forever. The lifeguard, who had a toned upper body and visible ribs, stood at the side of the pool watching me for ages, and then said to my mother, Your daughter could choke on all that water. My mother scowled back. And it’s your job to save her life. I want her to know what it feels like to be in the water. The lifeguard said, I think she’s felt enough. I would stop before it’s too late. My mother gave up on me and dipped down into the water. She hadn’t gone swimming for a long time, and she wanted to enjoy herself. It was as if the cut on her foot had transferred to me; I felt that my whole body was covered in cuts that were aggravated by the water. The lifeguard told her to let me swim in the little pool upstairs, where the water was shallower. We were both surprised to learn that there was a children’s pool. Why hadn’t they told us earlier? I climbed out, shivering with cold, while my mother glided back and forth like a mud loach, a girlish smile on her face as she waved at me. Go upstairs and practise. You’ll only hold me back here.

There were two small pools upstairs. And whichever way I looked at them, they were for soaking, not swimming. The water wasn’t blue, it was hot and there was sand at the bottom. I stepped into the smaller one. Standing up, the water just reached my calves. I tried to float in the water, but the tiles on the bottom kept sticking to my legs. Even without the float, it would have taken some effort to drown. While I was trying to practise, I heard a few people enter the downstairs pool. I could hear my mother laughing as she chatted with a group of men and women who had arrived together, and were about to race each other from one end of the pool to the other. The lifeguard shouted, Go! He seemed to be using a stopwatch. My little pool felt strange and quiet. I tried kicking the water a couple of times, and it sounded all right, but when I stopped splashing, there was no shark, no big wave. I was already on the beach, and it didn’t matter how I swam because I was stranded.

I leaned against the upstairs railing and looked down. A supple figure appeared in the vast blue swimming pool; it moved like a tadpole, feet flickering, legs moving as one, like a single tail. She swam to the far end of the pool, then almost without stopping, turned and swam back, leaving my mother and the others half a length behind her. I saw the lifeguard bring her a white bath towel, and I saw her nimbly pull herself onto the side of the pool, and sit there draped in the towel, casually kicking her dainty white feet in the water. My mother wiped water from her face, moved her goggles up to her forehead, and asked, How old are you? She said that she was eleven. I recognise you, Auntie, she added. Li Wu and I are classmates. My mother sat down next to her, and said, What a coincidence! My daughter’s here too. What’s your name? She should learn from you how to swim. She said that her name was Yang Yang. Before I could dodge out of sight, my mother raised her hand and pointed in my direction, as though blindly firing a gun. I stayed exactly where I was, though part of me fell to the ground as the gun fired. Li Wu’s a lost cause, my mother said. She’s in the shallow pool. Why don’t you go and find her? I waved stiffly down at Yang Yang. She looked up at me. She already had girlish curves, and as she stood up, drops of water rolled over the muscles on her leg. She laughed, Pshht. Her eyes were jet-black and kind, her eyebrows thick, almost meeting in the middle. She looked as if she had been born knowing how to swim, as if she had mastered sword fighting and hunting too. After she had done a few stretches at the side of the pool, she said goodbye to my mother and went to get changed.

Outside, after my mother and I had fastened our padded jackets, she looped a scarf several times around my neck and mouth. Did you know that your straps were slipping down your arms when you were standing at the railing? And when you saw your classmate, you didn’t say anything, you just did a silly smile, like the children at the special school across the road. I shook my head. It wasn’t a silly smile, I said. I was being sarcastic. My words were muffled by the scarf. Why? asked my mother. I thought about it as we walked along. We were almost home when I spoke again, my voice still muffled. It was a good thing she didn’t come upstairs. My sarcasm might have put her off. My mother looked at me quizzically, only then thinking to ask what it was like upstairs. How was the water? I pulled the scarf down and let out a long breath. The inside of my scarf was wet through and dotted with tiny crystals of ice. It was pretty deep, I said. I’m glad I had the float. And I can float now.

The day after we went to Hai Shan Swimming Pool, the cut on my mother’s foot was inflamed and very swollen. She tried to blame it on me, but I pushed back. You didn’t have to stay in the water so long. We ignored each other for a few days, and I stopped thinking about swimming; instead, it was Yang Yang in her swimming costume, the curves of her body, that kept appearing in my mind.

She’d already caught my attention at school. There was an arts academy in the city, and every year they would visit several primary schools looking for students with potential. The head teacher of the academy was a square-faced young man with sunglasses. He came in, glasses on, took a few steps in his leather shoes, then stopped, as if he were standing in a spotlight onstage, and looked at us all with disdain. The time I was part of the group selected for his consideration, I was in the front row. I held my shoulders so far back that they hurt, and when the man walked past, I gave a big smile, revealing my crooked canines. He raised an eyebrow, and moved on. I wished afterwards that I had chosen to look more serious. But Yang Yang had smiled too. She was standing behind me, and I could see her in the mirror. The man looked at her for a long time, and I heard him saying to himself, trembling with joy, Oh, please let me train you.

My mother took some time off work to recover. One day, when she woke up, I was already home from school, facing our old-style window frames with the brass fittings, crying, constantly wiping my tears across my temples, each wipe leaving a mark. She asked me what the matter was, and when I told her, she was quick to explain that I wasn’t selected because my posture wasn’t good enough. What’s good posture? I asked. She sat up in bed, holding her solid upper body straight, head up, chest open, eyes straight ahead, with a rigid smile, and said, See, this is good posture. I looked at her. Yang Yang didn’t look like that, she was very natural, I said. Who is Yang Yang? The girl at the swimming pool? my mother asked. Yes, I said, and went to sit on the edge of the bed by her legs, resting my head on her chest. I didn’t want to talk any more.

I decided to go to Hai Shan Swimming Pool the following Saturday on my own. My mother packed my bag, put her old PHS phone in my jacket pocket, and told me to call when I got there. She gave me three hours, after which I had to be home. My father tried to bargain with her. How about two hours? Two hours is enough for her to go swimming. He wanted to walk me there, but my mother and I wouldn’t let him, though we conceded that he could come and pick me up in three hours’ time. The woman checking tickets to the swimming pool wasn’t too concerned when she saw me on my own. Her eyes lit up. You’re back! How’s your mum’s foot? It’s much better, I said, almost following it up with, The family’s all fine. Like a long-lost auntie, she tucked some loose hair from around my temples into my swimming cap, and asked if I’d come to meet my friend, who she said was already inside. My mind shuddered as my subconscious nagged at me to sneak away. Yang Yang wasn’t exactly a friend. Does she swim on her own too? I asked the auntie, who seemed delighted to have someone to chat with, even a child. I stood in the shallow footbath, listening as she talked, disinfecting my feet for a long time. I learned that Yang Yang came swimming every Saturday. The lifeguard had been her teacher, but she didn’t need a coach any more – it was a hobby, one she was very good at. The lifeguard kept encouraging her to pursue it as a career, but Yang Yang’s parents didn’t agree. I thought I knew why: no one who knew how brightly she shone outside the swimming pool would agree. There were too many adults competing to train her. I figured that having too many choices must also be a problem.

As soon as I turned the corner, I saw her. She was swimming across the blue sea, the only person in the entire swimming pool. The lifeguard wasn’t there that day, and the height of the building, the smell of the chlorine and the lines she drew in the water made me feel lonely. I didn’t call out to her, just carried my float upstairs. I soaked silently in the little pool, listening to the sound of the water splashing downstairs. I pictured myself, aged five or six, going to the public baths with my mother for the first time, and standing under the steaming shower, surrounded by women chatting. Everything they said echoed, lulling me into a trance. I felt that no one would ever understand that sensation of being part of the world, and at the same time, being able to withdraw from it. Then I heard someone call my name. Li Wu! By the time I saw that it was Yang Yang, she was right in front of me. I stood up with a lot of splashing, and felt the warmth sink from my whole body down to my calves, to water level. Yang Yang looked down at her feet, then at me. Why don’t you come and swim in the pool? She stepped into the water with me, warming her feet while she sat on the edge, which made me realise that maybe it was for soaking your feet. I didn’t say anything. If you stay up here, you’ll never learn, she said. I don’t want to learn, I said. I only came for a shower. As soon as I said it, I regretted it. She looked at me and smiled. But you brought the float.

How about I teach you, starting with the basics? Yang Yang looked at me, her head tilted to one side. I looked away and when I looked back, Yang Yang had quietly stolen my float. Behind me, I heard the patter of her feet as she ran down the stairs and jumped into the swimming pool. I chased after her, leaning forwards on the poolside and shouted at her across the water. What are you doing? Yang Yang spat out a mouthful of water, and grinned. Come and get it. I looked at the pale pink board floating beside her. She swam back towards me, took a deep breath, and put her head underwater. I watched as her slender body spread out in the water, then floated up to the surface, and swayed gently, as if it was lighter than the float. Come and try. I turned around and started to climb down the ladder into the pool. I felt her cold fingertips on my calves. Yang Yang put her arms around my waist. Imagine that everything around you is air. The water is like air.

I wanted to break free from her, but I didn’t dare. She was a head taller than me and could stand up in the water and breathe easily, which I couldn’t. But I couldn’t wrap myself around her either, as I had with my mother. I wished I had never got in the pool. In the water, I couldn’t be sarcastic, that most basic form of self-defence. Yang Yang gave me orders, Put your hands on the edge. Hold the edge. Let go. Then she disappeared. I thrashed about in a panic. I swallowed some water and almost choked, but found I was rising. Yang Yang issued another order, Lift your feet off the ground. Lift your feet up, you won’t fall down. You’ll just float.

In the water that she said was like air, I felt a freedom that was almost like losing consciousness. As soon as my feet left the bottom of the pool, it was as if my legs were no longer mine; they drifted, as if they belonged to one universe, and I was in another. I couldn’t open my mouth, because it would still let in water, but I could hear what Yang Yang was saying. I was lighter than I had ever been before. I curled up, brought my legs to my chest, and pressed my toes against the tiles. Do you think I’m stupid? I asked. She shook her head. You’re not stupid, you just wouldn’t let go. Swimming is the best way of letting go, she said, That’s why I come. It’s the only time I can spread out my arms and legs, and really be myself.

I thought about this for a moment. It’s not the same for me, I said. I always have to tell myself to stand up straight or put on a smile. You shine wherever you are. Even when you don’t feel yourself, when you let go, there are people who love you. I couldn’t be more different. She watched me intently, and after a long time, she smiled again. Li Wu, look at me. Instead of looking at her face, I had been watching her legs changing shape in the water. The light refracting in the water kept distorting them. There were some blurry marks on her leg. I looked closer, thinking I must be mistaken, and she cooperatively raised the leg. My leg was on fire. The year before last, there was a fire in the Wufu community. I was home when it happened. I ran down the hallway, but I wasn’t fast enough, my leg got burned, and I fell. When I was taken to hospital my leg was much worse than this. I said that she was brave to bare her legs in public. I can’t hide it, she said. It’s better in the water, because people only see it through the splashing water as I swim, and splashes always look good. I looked her in the eye and said, You’re the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen. Yang Yang stood still for a moment, then jumped into the water again, and we stood there facing each other. If she hadn’t done that, I wouldn’t have realised that I was standing up in the water. When she came forward to hug me, the buoyancy of the water made it feel unreal, as though we had found one another in a dream.

My father came to collect me on time. Yang Yang didn’t get out of the pool with me, and I was reluctant to leave. I watched as she continued to swim up and down, then went to the shower room by myself to rinse off the chlorine. By the time I met my father, I was fully armed. He asked me on the way home if I’d got the basics. I said that I had, and that I wanted to come again every day of the week. He wasn’t expecting that, and walked ahead without a word, his bulky body in a red down jacket, carrying my pink shower bag. That was the extent of our conversation. When we got home, my mother was still in bed, watching TV. She turned down the volume, and kissed my pink face when I walked over to her. You look so much better after some exercise, she said.

For a while, when I walked past the arts academy, I would see Yang Yang’s photograph hanging at the front of the building. In time though, the picture, which showed her dressed in a purple tulle skirt, disappeared like an illusion. Despite this, I continued to see her all over the city. I would mention this while chatting with my mother, and she would always ask, Who’s Yang Yang? She hadn’t yet been back to the swimming pool; she was waiting for her foot to heal. Yang Yang’s the girl at the swimming pool, I said. The last time you were there you raced with her, remember, and she beat you. My mother frowned. I thought you two didn’t get along, she said. We’re friends, I said. We don’t say hello at school, we just smile when we see each other, but in the swimming pool, she’s like my shadow. My mother seemed pleased. I was worried about you, always being on your own, she said. She’s teaching me how to swim, and I keep her company – we both win. Besides, life is hard and good friends are few. My mother slapped the back of my head. Don’t say that life is hard in front of me. I have a harder life and fewer friends than you. I’m still here.

Where we live, summer passes quickly, and autumn even faster, but winter is long and slow. As the trees began to lose their leaves, ice started forming in the puddles on the dirt road in front of Hai Shan Swimming Pool. Yang Yang and I met at the pool every Saturday come rain or shine. I wasn’t a particularly good student, and she stopped trying to push me. Instead, we spent most of our time just floating in the water, drifting and talking. One day, Yang Yang arrived late. When she came through the door, my head was underwater while I practised holding my breath. I had been trying to open my eyes in the water without goggles, as Yang Yang did with ease, and I could just about manage it, but it was different for me: when I opened my eyes, I started seeing things, and it terrified me. Yang Yang came over and stood by my head at the poolside. I let out the breath I’d been holding, raised my head above water. She was just squatting there, watching me. Torturing yourself? she asked. You’re so late, I said. We’re moving, she said. They won’t let me come any more. I wanted to get out of the pool, to talk to her, but she said not to worry. There was a loud noise as she jumped in, splashing water all over my face. It was a different Yang Yang from usual, her back to the side of the pool, standing there calmly, her face pale, every hair of her eyebrows clearly visible. She whipped off her swimming cap with one hand and revealed a new boyish haircut. It was short and neat, and she used her wet fingers to smooth a stray hair on her forehead. Her hair parted naturally, as though styled with gel. A few wisps hung loose. She said, I have to go to Harbin.

Yang Yang looked at me without moving at all, her eyes as open as her shoulders. I thought for a while. It’ll be fine. Big cities are more fun, I said. Why are you so concerned about fun? she said. It’ll never be like this again: you and me in this big pool, swimming, doing whatever we like. I swallowed a couple of times. Some water had gone up my nose and was now in my throat. I couldn’t stop it from slipping down inside. She looked down and said, How about I teach you something else? You can do freestyle now. What about breaststroke? I looked at her. I haven’t learned anything, I said. I can’t even hold my breath. She laughed and said she hadn’t been a good teacher. I figured that I could at least float, and so we floated together, and she stole glances underwater, and told me I was good at floating.

While we were in the water, I noticed a lumpy patch just below Yang Yang’s ear, similar to the marks on her calf, mottled red and white, as though two rice porridges had been mixed together and had set on her skin. I felt I should say something; there might never be another chance. You are even braver than I thought, I said. I’m OK, she said. As she spoke, she touched the scar behind her ear. The fire burned me here as well. I always covered it with my hair. Now that I’m moving to a new environment, for some reason, I don’t know why, I don’t want to keep hiding and covering it. My mother says I’m crazy. What do you think? I asked her if she was burned anywhere else. She said yes, and showed me more, a little bit further back. She was smiling again. It was the same smile I had seen in the rehearsal room mirror that day. I didn’t know why Yang Yang wanted to tell me these things, just as I didn’t know why she had chosen to get close to me in the first place. Li Wu, she said. Today may be the closest we’ll ever be. We’ll go to middle school, then high school, then university. We may never see each other again. When I closed my eyes, I could feel her in front of me, watching me underwater.

We were still in the shower room as the three hours came to a close, standing under the shower heads, having taken off our swimming costumes, letting the water pour on our heads. Yang Yang was singing. She had been singing for a while, though I couldn’t work out what it was, and didn’t want to ask. Her babbling in the steam of the shower room was like the accompaniment to a dream, deepening the sense of parting. She turned off her shower, picked up my shower gel and shower puff, just like my mother, and put them in my shower bag. Then she squeezed under my shower head, her arm touching mine. Her skin was warm and smooth, whereas mine, even after being in the shower for so long, remained cold. I looked at her face, with water running across it, and saw a smile. I didn’t dare look down at anywhere on her body. We had always showered together, but separately, and surrounded by steam, so that we could hear but not see, and we had never looked at each other properly.

Her eyes seemed to be urging me to look but I didn’t. When you’ve gone, I said, I won’t come swimming here ever again. No matter who asks me to come. Yang Yang smiled. Well, she said, it’ll be closing down soon anyway. I turned off the shower and picked up my shower bag. She followed me out, swaying slightly. Perhaps we’d been standing in the shower room too long and needed some oxygen, because we were both slightly dizzy. We took our clothes out of our lockers and got dressed. She put on a duckling-yellow beanie and matching scarf. When we were both ready, we stood there face to face, and I remembered how we had met a year earlier. The PHS in my pocket kept vibrating, telling me my father was outside; he couldn’t come in and was getting impatient. Yang Yang pulled the scarf down from my mouth. Every time I go swimming, she said. I’ll think of you. When you miss me, just go to the swimming pool. Remember that water is like air. We can soak in the same water, and breathe the same air, and not be so far apart.

I left first. Yang Yang had always stayed on after I left, but I’d never known how long. My father was outside the building, smoking a cigarette. When he saw me, he tossed the butt aside, so cross he tripped over his words. You – you – what’s going on with you?

I didn’t know what was going on with me either. After Yang Yang left, I stopped going to Hai Shan Swimming Pool, and stopped mentioning her to my mother. Yang Yang and Hai Shan Swimming Pool seemed to share the same fate, and when I stopped thinking about them, they disappeared altogether. People no longer asked for the ‘bath house’, they took cabs to ‘opposite the special needs school’. Today, there is a private gynaecology and obstetrics hospital on the site of the old swimming pool, the remote location making it the ideal site for such a hospital. And who now could imagine that dirt road once housed an expanse of blue calm?

The coffee in front of me has gone cold, and as for my memory of Yang Yang and the swimming, it ends here. I did see her again, but that memory belongs not to this story, but to the wretched sequel to another reality, one I would erase if I could. The next time I saw her was in a shopping mall in Harbin. My mother had some errands there, so we went and stayed for a few days. While we were browsing the racks of shoes on the ground floor, Yang Yang walked up to me. I should have been surprised and excited to see her appear so suddenly, but we were both very calm. Li Wu? she said. Yang Yang? I said. We both smiled. You’ve come shopping? she said. You too? I said. She was on her own, likely waiting for someone, because after this she glanced at her watch, and hurriedly said goodbye. My mother had been trying on shoes, and as I watched Yang Yang walk away, she asked, Was that an old classmate? I said it was Yang Yang. She didn’t hear me properly, and didn’t seem to care, asking the salesperson to bring her another pair of shoes since the pair she’d tried were too small and pinched her feet.

Yang Yang was out of shape. It would be hard to convince anyone now that she had once been an excellent swimmer, that she had shone like a princess, a celebrity even, at least in those days when we had dust in our hair and dirt on our faces. I remembered the last thing she said to me when we were in the changing room: if we missed each other in future, we should go for a swim. It didn’t look as though she had swum much since then, and I couldn’t blame her – I never went back in the water either. As I’ve grown older, I’ve found that I wrap myself up tightly, avoid attention, think twice before speaking, and stick to safe environments. I prefer things to be steady and straightforward. My mother used to say that one must master a sport to learn how to breathe, and to discover one’s true self in stressful situations. Moments like that, when you can reveal your true self are rare.

My thoughts now are all jumbled up. If I were to return to the water with Yang Yang, how far would we be able to swim together? Hai Shan Swimming Pool no longer exists, many things no longer exist, but there are still traces of us in the water. With no one else around, the sound of the water in the empty swimming pool has stilled; only the laughter of young girls can be heard, as they talk about dinosaurs and the universe, jealousy and pride, words that float in the water like fish bait, catching one beautiful promise after another. The float slowly drifts away, it isn’t needed any more. That year, we were land and sea to each other. Mountains and rivers may shift, but they are always there.

    "text": "Richard, the great martyr, goes one day in March to the Palace of Westminster to sit in the Lords. As he crosses the Peers’ Lobby his heel-plates click against the tiles. The floor says, dieu et mon droit – dieu et mon droit – dieu et mon droit. The other peers say, ‘Ah, welcome back, Duke.’ He was last here six years ago, when he came down from Oxford to give his maiden speech.

The throne in the chamber is empty. Richard sits among the cross-benchers, languidly observing. On all sides he is surrounded by old people: jowly liver-spotted men in wrinkled suits, brown-toothed women in Thatcher drag, holding forth with tiresome decorum on coal imports, road safety, the economy of Northern Ireland. Richard has golden hair that parts in the middle and comes down past his ears. He wears a simple dark suit and gemstones on three of his fingers. The others can’t help looking at him. He feels them thinking, ‘Why is he here? To infect us? Or just to embarrass us?’ He does embarrass them. He is young, he is still fairly beautiful. He is back from the dead, he will show them all.

At half ten in the evening the house adjourns. Richard reclines in the library and rings the townhouse owned by William Bagot, Member for Warwick and Leamington.

William’s new wife picks up. She says, ‘Hullo, Richard. I’ve no idea where Will is, sorry.’

When Richard tries William’s office, William answers the call himself. He’s about five minutes north of Richard, in his little suite in one of the Norman Shaw buildings. He says, ‘I’ve just sent Carole home for the night. Talk dirty.’

‘No,’ Richard says. ‘I’m in the Lords Library.’

‘Ah, my little lord, exercising his hereditary right.’

‘I’d like to see you. Get us a room and I’ll meet you there.’

‘You could come to my office.’

‘If I went there this time of night I’d be accused of doing politics.’

‘Aren’t you?’

‘No. I’ve only come today because I needed the per diem.’

They meet at one of those late-Victorian railway hotels which are now all owned by American tycoons. The carpet lets off that scent of vigorous hoovering. Richard had applied a bit of L’Heure Bleue that morning, but by now it has faded.

‘It wasn’t cheap, I must say,’ says William.

‘You could have gone home and buggered your wife.’

‘Done what to her now?’

Richard gets on his knees and sucks William’s cock, which is pungent with sweat and unshaken-out piss. It is not quite the labourer’s stench; it puts one in mind of long lunches in the Members’ Dining Room, lots of crossing and uncrossing of legs. William comes on Richard’s face and Richard wipes the semen into his mouth and swallows.

They pause for whisky and cigarettes. William, with his trousers off but his socks and shirt still on, rings his secretary’s home number to tell her something he’d forgotten. Richard kneels between his legs and mouths his soft cock, his lovely heavy balls. Once William has rung off he slaps Richard’s face. He pulls Richard up by his collar and tears open his white Oxford shirt, tosses him face-down onto the bed. He yanks down Richard’s trousers and slaps his arse. He fucks Richard from behind, pushing his face into the floral duvet; he fucks Richard until it hurts, then takes off the condom and comes over Richard’s arsehole.

Satisfied, he runs Richard a bath. He sits in a chair by the tub and tells Richard what’s been happening in the other place. The Prime Minister will announce a general election soon, and William stands a chance of losing his seat.

‘To some chinless little scrap,’ Richard says.

‘With his canal boat holidays, five-a-side football, and biographies of Harry S. Truman.’

‘That’s sweet, really . . .’

‘How’s Edward, by the way?’

‘Oh, never mind. How’s Mr Major?’

They go for one more round, later that night. The curtains are shut, there is only a single lamp lit, and William kneels behind Richard and chokes him as he fucks him. There is a mirror across from the bed and they watch themselves in it. Richard sees his face flush as his vision spots white; his mouth is open, his eyes hypnotically empty, as he comes.

‘Oh! God!’ Edward says, when Richard comes home to Marylebone. ‘Your neck!’

Richard had looked at the bruises that morning, in the hotel, and pressed his fingers to them until they were sore again. William had been solicitous too, unsexily so: he had said, You’re not really hurt? And Richard had said, I’m dying anyway. But you’re not, William had said. The treatment is working.

‘I’d quite like a cup of tea,’ Richard says.

In the grey afternoon, in the study, Edward says, ‘I hope you enjoyed it.’

He sits at the desk while Richard lounges on the sofa and smokes. He has been writing cheques, balancing the chequebook, on Richard’s behalf. Richard, after a night with William, thinks Edward looks young. His face is smooth, lightly freckled, and his hair is thick. His tortoiseshell glasses somehow have the effect of making him look a bit unintelligent. He and Richard were born the same year, but Richard has had his birthday and Edward hasn’t.

‘Very much so, thanks,’ Richard says. ‘Don’t mope over it, darling, it’s just sex.’

‘Except that you tell him how to vote, and what sort of speeches he should make in the Commons.’

‘Well, it’ll all be over by summer.’

Henry Green, QC, is another one of those educated men with receding brown curls and a soft middle. His wrinkles are the kind that show he reads, writes, types, and telephones. He has a cottage in Devon and a detached red-brick Victorian south of Hampstead Heath which his estranged wife has vacated even though her father helped pay for it. He never had children by her; he did get a girl pregnant while he was training for the Bar, but she had an abortion.

Green wears calfskin gloves and gives Richard thirty lashes with a rattan cane that had come down from a grandfather who had served in the Imperial Police towards the end of the Raj. They do this in the sitting room, with the curtains closed, as the sun sets, so that darkness comes over them. Green finishes himself off over Richard’s bare, sore arse, then turns on a lamp and offers Richard a gin and tonic. They never fuck; Green once got drunk and told Richard the story of how in his first year at his public school he’d been violently buggered by three older boys in the showers after rugby practice. He pretends that he dislikes William for being common, but really it must be because William had the soft, untroubled youth of a grammar school boy.

‘I had dinner with Will Bagot the other night,’ Green mentions. ‘He asked me if I knew of any jobs going. Then he left me with the bill.’

‘It’s not your employment that’s in jeopardy.’

‘Will you contribute to his campaign?’

‘Oh, God, no,’ Richard says. ‘I haven’t got the money. Actually, I was going to ask you to take me to dinner.’

Green does take him out, if only to watch him wince as he sits down. They eat noisettes de chevreuil and Green tells Richard about his divorce. In the taxi back, Richard rubs Green’s cock through his trousers. Green kisses the bruises on Richard’s neck that William left.

It is almost a perfect night, except that when they go to bed Green canes him again and then suddenly stops, saying, ‘Oh! Oh dear. Oh dear oh dear.’

There is blood on the linen Green’s wife had picked out. Green strips the bed himself; he takes the bloodied linen down to the lower ground floor and puts it in the wash with chlorine bleach.

Edward runs Richard’s bath for him and helps him dress, and is petulantly silent, sulking through this rendering of service. He pesters Richard about taking his tablets. ‘Have you taken them yet? Have you really?’

At last (it is early in the morning, he is tired and his neck is stiff) Richard shrieks: WHY ARE YOU SUCH A BORE. YOU ONLY WANT TO KEEP ME ALIVE SO YOU CAN GO ON LIVING IN MY HOUSE. He flings his little cloisonné pillbox in Edward’s direction; the tablets spill and lodge themselves between the floorboards.

‘No,’ Edward says, sighing, ‘it’s not just that. I like when you fuck me, too.’

Two years ago, Richard had not been more than a year from death. He had traded the house in Marylebone and the bed with the blue canopy for an AIDS ward in a teaching hospital, a metal-framed cot with a rolling tray over it and his chart on a clipboard at the foot. Edward, whose father is a Hertfordshire barrister, had gone with Richard to meet his solicitor about his will, understanding that after the repayment of debts and the payment of death duties there would be nothing left for loyal companions. He’d told Richard how his parents had asked him what he would do once Richard was dead: ‘You’ve no profession,’ they’d said, ‘no money of your own, just –’

Driving Richard to hospital, carrying in the suitcases, unpacking the silk pyjamas and the woollen jumpers and the velvet slippers and Richard’s weight (then under ten stone) in books; filling one of those baby-bottleish hospital cups with the kind of rehydrating formula given to victims of famine, forcing Richard to drink it, promising coffee and cocktails later; emptying the plastic jug into which Richard pissed, or into which his catheter flowed. Going out alone to Richard’s favourite restaurants, bringing back insulated containers of veal cutlet, lamb chop, gratin dauphinois, mousse au chocolat; forcing Richard to eat it. Driving back to Marylebone to hand-wash the pyjamas when inevitably they were soiled. Reading aloud to Richard, watching telly with Richard, sitting quietly next to him with the lamps off and the curtains shut against the sun.

Richard is twenty-seven, now. He doesn’t know where death has gone. He last weighed in at eleven and a half stone, and his last T-cell count was an astonishing 350. Two or three times a week he and Edward walk down the road to the health club, swim forty lengths, then sit in the sauna. At least once a month they drive up for a few days at Lancaster Park, to enjoy country pursuits. They fuck more often than they did at twenty. When Richard examines his conscience, he notes that he lacks gratitude for the worldly processes by which he is kept alive. Blood tests, appointments with specialists, timers set to go off at seven, three, and eleven. Edward appearing with a cup of milky tea, two biscuits on the saucer, zalcitabine, saquinavir, zidovudine.

Lowering himself to the floor, Edward says, ‘My dad told me I was your dog.’

‘Oh, but a handsome fine greyhound, red brindle, with a neck like a swan’s and cute little ears and a long tail, and the blood of a hare wetting its muzzle.’

Richard goes the following evening to William’s office, carrying a bouquet with narcissi for Carole, whom he then dismisses. He goes into the small inner room and shuts but doesn’t lock the door behind him. He looks through the papers on William’s desk, then turns off the overhead light and sinks to his knees in front of William’s chair and gives him a long, wet blowjob.

Before William comes Richard says, ‘You can fuck me if you’ve got a condom. I don’t know if you have them lying about?’

The only MPs who don’t keep condoms at hand are those who risk shagging without them. William puts one on and bends Richard over the desk. Pulling down Richard’s trousers, he says, ‘Ah. Henry Green got to you first.’

‘Oh, yes, he’s got such a lot of stress to work off. It’s the divorce.’

‘Lucy has moved on quickly enough.’

‘Well, if she wants children she’ll have to have them soon.’

They find afterwards that the box of tissues on William’s desk is empty.

‘Gosh, you really have been hard at work,’ Richard says.

‘I use them to blow my nose.’

Refusing to clean his arse with his handkerchief, Richard makes William strip from the waist down and hand over his Y-fronts. William puts them back on once Richard is done, saying that if he left them in the wastebasket, the tabloids would find them and have them DNA tested.

 

–

 

The dawn comes up darkly, with rain. One of the windows has been left half-open; a cold breeze moves the curtains. Edward sleeps on his stomach. His lips are parted, showing his long front teeth, one of which slightly overlaps the other.

Richard looks up at the underside of the canopy, at the sun with its wiggling rays embroidered in gold thread. He gets up, pisses, and cleans his teeth, then dresses himself soberly and drives to Knightsbridge for eight a.m. mass at the Oratory. Gloria in excelsis Deo, et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis. Laudamus te. Benedicimus te. Adoramus te. Glorificamus te.

Parliament is prorogued on the twenty-first of March. There are some cynics who suggest the Prime Minister has done this to delay the publication of a report by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards that will find Tory MPs took bribes from the Egyptian businessman who bought Harrods. It would of course have been wicked of them if they had.

William asks Richard up to Warwickshire for a couple of days. He has a sort of ‘country house’ south of Leamington Spa, a former estate cottage in higgledy-piggledy brick. Richard drives himself. He parks in the driveway and Nicola, the new wife, pops out from the side door, saying, ‘Hello! What a car! Let me take your bags.’

William’s thirteen-year-old daughter is there, too. Gemma has the broad-faced, snub-nosed, plain-pretty looks of her mother, though William’s current and former wives are more or less identical, and she could easily have passed for Nicola’s child. There is evidence of a frightful infatuation with Richard: she keeps her head down, she speaks to him only when he addresses her, but lingers near him until her father sends her away.

After dinner, Richard and William drink port in the lounge. Richard says, ‘If she were a few years older I might elope with her.’

‘That’s not funny, Richard.’

‘Oh, you’re so-o congenitally middle class.’

‘If you ever have a daughter of your own – well, you won’t.’

‘No, I suppose not,’ Richard says.

 

–

 

He wakes the next morning with the feeling that a cold is coming on. His head hurts, his throat is sore. He goes down to the kitchen and William is there, in a striped dressing gown, failing to negotiate with his own espresso machine. Richard makes coffee Turkish-style, in a pot on the stove. It is one of the few domestic tasks he has learned to do himself. He kisses William like he does after sucking his cock, with almost too much spit and tongue.

William says, ‘I’d rather not be tempted.’

Still, he holds Richard’s half-hard cock through his pyjamas. He looks into Richard’s eyes as he does it. Richard has always had the sense that, for other people, looking at him is a test of longevity in the face of pain, like putting one’s hand in the fire. But what do they think a look will do?

William kisses Richard’s cheek and says, ‘I’m going to have a shower.’

Nicola enters the kitchen dressed already in a cotton frock with buttons all the way down. She grills sausages in the Aga. The sky is grey; doves coo loudly from the shrubbery.

‘Do you feel your childhood was happy?’ Nicola asks Richard.

Richard says, ‘Oh yes.’

‘You really think so? I’m always suspicious of people who say that, because then it always transpires that their parents separated and their father shot their cat, or something.’

‘No, I had everything I could have wanted. My father did die, but by then I had already been away at school for a couple of years.’

‘Oh no,’ says Nicola. ‘I’m sorry. I’m an orphan. Well, I am now – my mum died when I was twenty-five, and my father the year after. So I didn’t have to go into an orphanage, or get sent to a maiden aunt.’

‘Do you know it’s Palm Sunday? Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an ass’s colt, and the people went forth to him with palm branches. It was the last Sunday before the Crucifixion.’

‘Will told me you threatened to elope with Gemma.’

‘Oh, that. I was just making Will squirm.’

‘I know. But you can’t let her hear of it. She’ll believe you. She’ll spend the rest of her life wondering why you never did. She’ll think you decided she was too plain. And when a decently brought-up, dark-haired man asks her to marry him, she’ll say she once almost eloped with Richard, the young Duke of Lancaster, when she was a schoolgirl, in 1997, just before her father lost his seat.’

St Mary’s, Warwick has a late mediaeval chapel, associated with the earls of Warwick, where Elizabeth I’s favourite Robert Dudley is entombed. The church by Warwick Castle is a rare eighteenth-century Gothic revival. But the Jephson Women’s Institute spring cakes and crafts fair, which Nicola is judging, is held in the hall next to a late-Victorian C of E parish church that resembles an indifferently-constructed set of a school play. The hall is low-ceilinged; Richard feels that his head is nearly up against the fluorescents. Folding tables with pink checked cloths display sponge cake, madeleines, cookies decorated to look like Easter eggs, tea urns, tea cosies, cross-stitch hoops, quilt squares, for some reason the odd Christmas ornament. William, with ostentatious humility, hands over a few coins in exchange for his poppyseed loaf and Styrofoam cup of char.

Richard is introduced by William as ‘my friend, the Duke of Lancaster.’ The women laugh and say, ‘No one told us we were going to have a duke.’ There is a reproach in that for William: why not tell us beforehand, so we could look him up in Debrett? Richard doesn’t give his Christian name, but learns the names of the eight members. These are just like the women Richard meets at village fetes, agricultural shows, tenants’ dinners, local history society fundraisers: women who have always treated him like they would his father or grandfather, even when he was a child. They wear cotton cardigans and polyester trousers.

Margaret, who was born around the time that Hitler invaded Poland, offers Richard a hot cross bun which she has added extra icing to. He bites, chews, swallows, then slips his tongue out of the corner of mouth for a flirtatious half-second. He says, ‘I’ve got icing all over my face, haven’t I?’ Margaret offers him a paper napkin with an Easter bunny design, and he says, ‘Thanks terribly, Margaret. Actually, I have a handkerchief.’

‘My mother, when we were growing up,’ Margaret says, ‘always used to tuck our handkerchiefs into our pockets before we went off to school. But somewhere along the way I got rid of them all, which is really such a shame, now that I see your beautiful one.’

‘Oh yes? This was embroidered for me by my mother. These are broom flowers. They’re a sort of family symbol.’

Gemma wears an Alice band and a department-store daisy-print frock. She sits on a plastic chair and reads Tatler. ‘The new homeless: how the shortage of £1-million-plus houses is forcing the rich on to the streets. The new sex: why gardening is better than chocolate.’ Richard supposes that women are the newer sex, comparatively! When he escapes through the side door to smoke, Gemma comes after him.

Exhaling, Richard says, ‘I hope you’re not going to ask me to give you a cigarette.’

‘I’ve smoked my mum’s before,’ she says.

‘Mm. Well, you know, I would if we were alone, but your father and stepmother are here, and then there are all of these nice women whose votes your father hopes to win.’

‘I’ve seen you in Tatler. You’re not in this issue, but you’ve been in some other ones.’

‘Oh, have you?’

‘I have a subscription here and for my mum’s house, so I read each issue twice. And then I give the extra to my friend Louise who can’t afford a subscription.’

‘You’re quite pretty,’ he tells her. ‘You could be in it someday.’

‘Not on the cover?’

‘We’ll have to see how you turn out.’

‘Um . . . with your illness, do you go to hospital . . . often?’

‘Surely that’s not the question you’ve been waiting to put to me.’

He smiles at her through the smoke. She lowers her eyes, goes stiff and red.

‘I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be rude,’ she says.

‘I’ll answer one question honestly,’ he says. ‘But you’ll have to look into my eyes to ask it.’

She looks into his eyes. She spends a long time looking. He spends a long time looking at her, at the three spots on her upper lip, the youthful whiteness of her sclera. His cigarette burns between his fore and middle fingers.

Richard doesn’t come down for drinks before dinner; he really does feel ill. It’s the kind of cold he always has, with a runny nose and a dry cough and a throat that hurts especially when he swallows. William comes up, knocks, and enters without being asked in.

‘Mm . . . no,’ he says to Richard, ‘you don’t look well.’

He puts the back of his hand to Richard’s forehead. Richard recognises the gesture as paternal play-acting, a perfunctory acknowledgment of duty by a man who finds it difficult to believe he is no longer a boy himself. He takes William’s face in his hands and kisses him, licking William’s spit out of his mouth.

‘Now you’ll catch whatever I have.’

‘A head cold won’t kill me,’ William says.

The house is so small and noisy that Richard wonders how the three of them hide from one another. He hears William walk down the corridor, descend the stairs, talk to Nicola and Gemma in the kitchen, though he can’t make out what they say. A slower, lighter step ascends the stairs. There is the rattle of a tray being set down on the console outside of Richard’s bedroom.

‘Room service,’ Nicola says. ‘No, it’s just me, I’ve brought dinner up for you. I’m sorry you’re feeling so badly. Just pop the tray back on this table when you’re done with it, and I’ll take everything away.’

‘Come in,’ Richard commands.

She’s dressed for dinner, in dark velvet and gold earrings. He casts his gaze towards the writing desk; she unfolds the leaf and puts the tray down there.

‘It’s just lamb with mint sauce, and, um, parsnips, carrots, and potatoes. Healthy enough. And I’ve brought a glass of wine . . . I think the Victorians used to give wine to invalids, didn’t they? And then there’s baked apple pudding.’

‘I’m sorry I couldn’t come to table,’ Richard says. ‘I would have liked to. To play happy families with you.’

‘No . . . no. You must get well.’

‘It’s New Zealand lamb?’

‘Mm.’

‘Do you remember the last British lamb you had? The last time I had it must have been at home, because at school they only gave us pork, beef, or fish.’

‘Gosh, you know – it’s the sort of thing you don’t remember because you don’t know to remember it at the time. When Chernobyl happened I was living in a flat in Fulham with three other girls, and the only things we’d cook were soup from a tin or fried eggs or things like that.’

‘Nicola, darling,’ Richard says. ‘Come here and let me take your hand.’

She sits – perhaps feeling it is her right, as the lady of the house – on the edge of the bed, and lets Richard take both of her hands in his.

‘I don’t know why,’ she says, ‘but I was so unhappy, back then. I mean, my parents had just died, and I’d no-one to go home to at Christmas except a grandmother who’d complain that I was showing too much leg, but it wasn’t the grief, it was the feeling that every other girl in London was prettier, richer, or cleverer than me. You remind me, you know, of the boy I was in love with then. Digby Hughes-Duntze . . . He was so handsome. I saw him at every party, and he never remembered who I was. You wouldn’t know what that’s like.’

‘I’ve been in love with men before.’

‘But I’ll bet they remember you.’

Richard caresses her hands. He says, ‘I hope you and William will be blessed with children.’

Nicola says, ‘Um, yes. Me, too. Very much.’

On Good Friday, Richard does the Stations of the Cross at the London Oratory, along with several other sorry sinners who keep looking at him as they pray. He is wearing a white wool overcoat.

Jesus falls the third time, and Richard begins to be enraged by His suffering. Yes, yes, so you suffer more perfectly than anyone else because you’re the son of God. And it’s my fault because I can’t stop sinning.

Beneath the marble relief of Jesus stripped of his garments, Richard wipes his nose, then kneels and murmurs a Pater Noster. He imagines having his coat and suit torn off, being stripped even of his striped socks. He imagines being tied to the altar rail and whipped until his thighs are wet with blood.

They have drinks at the hotel bar, first. William tells Richard about the preparations for his campaign. He pays for the drinks with one of his campaign-related cards, though he has paid in cash, he tells Richard, for the room.

In the room there is just enough space to walk around the big, white bed. The worn carpet is cream-coloured, the faux-Georgian panelling butter-yellow. There are scuffs and chips at the bottoms of the doorframes. The mirror – a small one, hung above the little desk, offset from the bed – is streaky.

William tunes the black plastic clock-radio to ‘The World Tonight’. Richard drops to his knees, and William lifts his foot so that the sole of his shoe dirties the front of Richard’s white silk shirt. He presses forward until Richard falls back onto the floor. Slowly the scarred leather sole comes to occlude Richard’s vision. Richard shuts his eyes and sticks out his tongue until he tastes the Palace of Westminster’s degenerating Pugin-Minton tiles.

When Richard tries to get his cock out, William nudges his side with the toe until he rolls onto his front. Then William pulls Richard’s trousers down to his knees and fucks him. He comes inside of the condom inside of Richard, and lies afterwards on top of him, pinning him to the floor. Richard’s stiff cock chafes against the carpet. His nose drips onto his lip. At last William sits up and takes off the condom, then takes off Richard’s clothes.

Naked, lying in that narrow channel between the dresser and the bed, Richard lets himself be looked at. It makes him sad to be admired like this, but he couldn’t live if he wasn’t.

‘Nicola tells me you told her you hoped we’d have children,’ William says.

‘I do.’

‘She is pregnant. It’s still too early to announce.’

‘Oh. I’m so happy for you.’

William picks Richard up and puts him down on the bed. He unbuttons his own shirt, pulls off his own trousers. He ransacks his jacket pockets for another condom.

‘With any luck I’ll get a boy this time.’

‘Yes, it would be nice if you did.’

The second round starts with Richard riding William, looking down at him. There must be something William doesn’t like about that: before Richard can come, William tips him back, gets on top of him, and fucks him like a man fucks a wife. He does this until Richard is crying out. With his cock still inside of Richard, he stops, kisses him sweetly. He withdraws just far enough that he can peel the condom off, then keeps fucking him. He comes inside of him, kissing him, and stays hard long enough that he can fuck Richard into an orgasm that really is like death.

On the radio, a man is reading a Conrad story about duelling hussars in Napoleon’s Grande Armée. Richard is lying on his back, wet between the legs, wet in the eyes – that is, weeping.

William sits up, saying, ‘Please, don’t do that.’

‘What if all of my ancestors back to the very beginning, and all of the people who are going to learn about me after I’m dead, will all know everything I’ve done, and hate me for it?’

‘Sounds like displaced fear of God.’

‘But God forgives.’

‘There’s such a sense of melodrama about it all – your religion. People are always having fits, and bleeding spontaneously, and calling it a miracle.’

‘I believe in it,’ Richard says.

William retrieves Richard’s handkerchief and blots Richard’s face with it. He says, ‘Yes, sweetie. I know. Come here.’

Richard is sent back to Marylebone in a cab. Riding along the empty park, illuminated by ugly, sharp lamplight, he starts to cry again. When he lets himself back into the house, the lamps are off and Edward is asleep in their – in Richard’s – bed. Richard sits on his side of the bed and cries until Edward wakes up.

‘What,’ Edward says.

‘I don’t really want to die,’ Richard says.

‘Well, you won’t, darling.’

‘Ugh, I hate when you try to console me. You get such an awful tone to your voice. Well, you won’t, dar-ling . . . Is that how your mother used to talk to you? All my mother ever says is that she’ll pray a novena for me.’

‘Do you not want me here?’

‘Of course I do,’ Richard says. ‘If you leave me alone I’ll die.’

‘Honestly, you might. You wouldn’t have picked up those tablets yourself.’

‘You’re still going on about the tablets.’

‘Did you take your elevens?’

‘Oh my God. I am going to Lord Lucan you.’

Bravely Edward turns on the lamp and goes down the corridor to the bathroom. Richard hears him filling a glass from the sink. He comes back and shakes three tablets out of the pillbox.

‘Open hand,’ Edward commands.

Richard sticks out his tongue; Edward puts the two smaller tablets on it, then gives him a sip of water, then gives him the third, larger tablet, then another sip. Then Edward kisses him, and Richard says, ‘I can’t believe I love you as much as I do.’

Edward is very easy to get with lines like these. He flushes beautifully. Richard smiles at him and holds the side of his face.

‘It’s just all of these old men,’ Richard says, ‘with their wives and children.’

‘They’re not old. They’re like forty-five.’

‘Older than I’ll ever be.’

‘Richard –’

‘Metaphorically,’ Richard says. ‘Or in spirit.’

‘Because of the children?’

‘You could still have them, you know.’

‘Not . . . not really.’

‘I would be happy if you did. I’d even be happy if you had a wife.’

‘I just don’t think I will,’ Edward says.

Richard pulls Edward into bed and kisses him until they’re hard. They rub against each other through their clothes like Richard used to do at school with the boy he loved then. He rolls Edward onto his stomach and pulls off his cute little pinstriped pyjama trousers; he plays with Edward’s arsehole a bit before getting up for a condom and K-Y, and to take his own clothes off. He kisses the back of Edward’s neck and rubs his cock against Edward’s arsehole until he sees that Edward is flushed down to his shoulders. Then he fucks him: he puts one hand on the headboard and one hand on Edward’s hip, and gives his whole strength to the endeavour. He makes Edward cry out; he makes them both sweat. He turns Edward over and fucks him face-to-face, and keeps at it until Edward, whose cheeks are deep red, gives a precious wobble of the lower lip and says, ‘Oh – oh my God. I’m coming.’

Richard hardly cares to come himself, after that. But he won’t forgo an orgasm that’s more or less inevitable, so he lies back and looks up at the underside of the canopy and tosses himself off as Edward pants beside him.

‘I bled on Henry Green’s wife’s linen,’ Richard says.

‘I thought he was divorced.’

‘Well, not yet. She’s living elsewhere, but she hasn’t taken her nice things out of the house.’

‘Yeah . . . Well, it’s her fault, isn’t it, when she knows what her husband does when she’s not there . . .’

‘I was bent over the bed,’ Richard says, ‘and my face was down, my eyes were closed, and he said, “Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.” Like I’d made a mistake. It was just a spatter, like from the flick of a paintbrush. I’ve lost more blood from a nosebleed. But he scrubbed my arse-cheeks with a hand towel and then stripped the bed and put it all in the wash with bleach. I laughed at him. I said, “If you’re that afraid, you shouldn’t be having an affair with me.” He said he wasn’t afraid. But he was lying.’

Edward says, ‘I’m not afraid.’

Coming up the long drive, Richard looks at Lancaster Park and thinks exactly what he should not: This is all mine. He feels about it just like he does about his body. The roof leaks, the cellars flood, the damp rises, the foundations sink, the coal-fired boiler is so old that there is only one man left in England who can repair it. Each time Richard comes home there is another part of the house that has rotted away. But he’ll be gone before the house, so what does it matter?

Richard’s mother kisses his cheek, then flings her arms around him and squeezes. She kisses Edward’s cheek. Her cloudy-eyed, foul-smelling old Pekingese gets underfoot. She says, ‘So good to see you again, Ned. How are your parents? How was the drive up? Does Dickie ever let you drive that thing? Oh, lovely flowers! For me!’

It is Holy Saturday. That night the three of them attend the Easter Vigil at Lancaster Cathedral, where a triptych above the altar presents scenes from the Passion edged by gilding almost Islamic in its curvilinearity. In the dark, the stained glass is invisible; the light of God is in the candles, which deepen the night.

The bells toll. Along with the choir Richard sings: Filius Patris, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis. The tears come again. God is here, and Richard is in a state of mortal sin. He could have received the Host if he had only confessed, but he couldn’t confess, because he wasn’t sorry.

Alone in the kitchen past midnight, Richard and his mother smoke cigarettes and drink Armagnac, sitting across from each other at the long scullery table where the staff have always eaten. His mother wears a mint-green cotton bathrobe over a 30s film star sort of nightgown; her face is stage-white, covered in night cream.

‘I’ve been having such a hard time with these headaches,’ she says. ‘I always have to lie down. I drove into town to see Dr Thompson and he told me to take more salt. I don’t know what “more” means. Am I supposed to be spooning it into my mouth from the salt cellar? Anyway, I had Thomas and Eleanor and Roger and Gillian last weekend. And Roger’s niece, Teresa, who’s quite clean. I would tell you to marry her, but I just don’t like Roger. He gets appallingly drunk, and vomits into the wastebasket in his room.’

‘I told Edward he should get married,’ Richard says.

‘Shall I introduce him to Teresa?’

‘He said he wouldn’t.’

‘Well, of course he says that.’

Richard’s mother is known to have been a great beauty in her youth. She married at nineteen because she was proposed to by a better man than she could have expected to offer, an officer of the Grenadier Guards who was at least square-jawed and strapping despite having eyebrows that met in the middle. It was through this first husband that she met Richard’s father. Richard’s father is known to have been a great beauty, also. His mother was a Dutch model; his father was the Duke of Lancaster, a title which he himself would not live to inherit. He was captain of his school’s First XV, and took two years to climb the Alps before studying agriculture at RAU Cirencester. He rode, hunted, shot; he drank at the village pub with his father’s tenants , one of whom described him posthumously to Richard as having never been driven indoors by the rain. But he spent the last ten years of his life indoors, in his bedroom or in an armchair in the smoking room with the fire going, holding a hot water bottle to his stomach, hobbling every thirty minutes down the corridor to the loo, shitting himself sometimes when he couldn’t help it, snarling at his wife about the tea being cold, the milk being sour, the fire being smoky, the dogs being muddy, the gardens being overgrown.

Richard takes Edward to ride to hounds one last time before the season is out. They join the Caton Hunt, who for forty years have been given leave to hunt over the land owned by the dukes of Lancaster. Before that, there had been kennels at Lancaster Park. The subscribers are small landowners, local professionals; Richard resents that they are not the country squires of eighteenth-century political cartoons. Mounted, they gather on the grass at the entrance to the wood and drink their glasses of port. The horses breathe visibly into the dawn air.

Edward – in white breeches and a red coat with hunt buttons, astride the thoroughbred hunter Richard gave him for his twentieth birthday – is a true prince of the sport. He rides with an arrogant posture he never takes when he isn’t on a horse. Once the hounds find the scent, he rides hard; he stays at the front of the field and jumps every hedgerow and fence. Richard waits for the gates to be opened.

Over the course of the morning the fox is lost twice. The sun keeps rising, the hounds begin to strain. A great stretch of country is hunted. The followers fall behind, disappear into the wood. But when the fox breaks cover the third time, it lags across a wide, fallow field and the hounds overtake it. Richard watches from some distance. The huntsman blows his horn to announce the death, then dismounts and takes the head and tail before giving the corpse back to the hounds. The limbs are torn from the body; the guts are spilled; the scraps are tossed from one muzzle to another. Edward keeps his hunter steady; he sits straight-backed and panting, with his red hair curling out from under his cap. He doesn’t look back at Richard until the horn signals the hounds to go home.

Edward comes to Richard’s room that night. He strikes a match, lights one of the candles on the mantlepiece, and takes his glasses off. The room still smells of woodsmoke and of the last cigarette Richard smoked before turning off the lamp. The candlelight brings out from the darkness just the slightest impression of the picture above the fireplace, a thickly-worked study of a swan in dark water that had been painted by a lover of Richard’s great-grandfather. The wall next to the bed is taken up by a seventeenth-century tapestry depicting huntsmen in pursuit of a stag.

Richard says, ‘Will you get the fire going again?’

‘No,’ Edward says, whipping the covers back. He seizes Richard by the ankles and pulls him out of bed.

Richard is naked; his bare knees thump sharply down against the Persian carpet, beneath which is hard oak. He lowers himself to kiss Edward’s feet before he puts Edward’s cock in his mouth. Edward gets his hands in Richard’s hair but keeps them still and lets Richard suck him off. He’s a Catholic, too, he knows how long it takes for the supplicant’s pleasure at penitential discomfort to turn into real agony. By the time Edward does come – thickly, in Richard’s mouth – Richard’s knees hurt so much that in order to tolerate it he has to let himself accept the pain.

‘Swallow,’ Edward says.

Having swallowed, Richard says, ‘Le Prince d’Aquitaine à la tour abolie. Ha ha.’

It’s a joke he’s made before. Edward slaps Richard’s face; Richard turns his cheek and Edward slaps him again. Then Edward puts two fingers in Richard’s mouth and Richard sucks them until Edward is hard again.

When Edward fucks Richard, he gets down on the floor to do it: he sits with his legs under him and pulls Richard into his lap. Slowly Richard falls back until the carpet is scratching his shoulders. He looks up at Edward’s foolish frown, his open mouth. He says, ‘I wish I were a girl. I’d have kept myself pure. You could have married me, and broken my hymen on our wedding night. I would have had a dozen of your children.’ Then he says, ‘Oh, God,’ because he’s coming. ‘Keep fucking me,’ he says, ‘come inside me.’

‘I am,’ Edward says. ‘Fuck. Oh. Oh.’

They lie next to each other and watch the cracks in the ceiling moving with the candlelight. Richard scrubs his semen from his stomach with Edward’s dressing gown. Then he takes the condom off Edward’s cock and licks him clean.

‘Oww,’ Edward says. ‘Ohh. I can’t take it, my cock’s wrung like a fucking . . . chicken’s neck.’

Richard says, ‘Mine’s fine.’

He drops another piece of wood into the fireplace, on top of the red coals, then tosses in a few crumpled pages of the Telegraph and strikes a match.

Getting into bed again, Edward says, ‘You wouldn’t really want to be a girl and bear my children.’

‘Christ. No.’

‘I mean, you wouldn’t have inherited the title, for one thing.’

‘Well, no.’

Richard pinches out the candle with his thumb and forefinger. It hurts for about thirty seconds, a novelty among the other pains.

‘Mm . . .’ Edward yawns. ‘I hope we’ll have time for a little trot round the park after mass tomorrow. See the deer.’

Richard sees William’s daughter once more, late in June of that year. He is driving home after a party in Chelsea and he sees her waiting for a night bus, alone, in a black miniskirt and black tights. The convertible top is down, so that she sees him, too.

‘Good God,’ he says. ‘You’re lucky I happened to be here to ferry you home.’

She’d gone out, she tells him, with a cousin and the cousin’s friends from Cheltenham Ladies’. They hadn’t liked her, they had made fun of her, and they had left for an afterparty without giving her the address. She’s staying this week at her mother’s house in Richmond, but Richard says he doesn’t mind taking her there. He likes a long drive on a fine summer night, with the moon a voyeur somewhere above him. Gemma looks through his cassettes and says she doesn’t know what any of them are. It is the happiest she has ever been, he supposes: in London, out past midnight, riding along the King’s Road in the passenger seat of a yellow sports car driven by a good-looking man she thinks might ask her to one of his parties, later.

He says, ‘I saw your father on television, losing his seat. Were you there?’

‘No, I had school in the morning, so they wouldn’t let me come. But they left me at home alone, so I stayed up anyway and watched it on telly. And then I asked them not to have to go to school because everyone would be talking about it, but they made me, and then everyone was talking about it.’

‘What will he do now?’

‘I don’t know. He’s going to be the director of a company, or something.’

‘I hope you weren’t disappointed.’

‘No. I don’t really care.’

They are crossing the river, passing the dense silhouettes of the trees on the grounds of Fulham Palace. Gemma is turning the radio dial, lingering in the static. Lampposts rise at intervals along each side of the bridge; their triple circles of light – in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti – obscure the dark water below.

Too shy to pose it as a question, she says, ‘So you couldn’t ever have children. Even if you decided to be straight.’

‘No,’ he says.

‘So you won’t have an heir to pass everything on to.’

‘No.’

‘Who’s going to get it instead?’

‘A cousin. My father’s younger brother’s son.’

‘Oh . . . Do you wish you could have children just, like, in a normal way? I mean, like, just to be a father?’

‘Well, it doesn’t matter now.’

‘Dad and Nicola have these awful fights over you.’

‘I’m sorry.’

She asks him, ‘But what do you wish?’

‘I don’t wish anything, darling.’

The windows of her mother’s house are dark, though the porch light is on. Ivy droops from the facade, heavy with new growth and stirring in the air. Gemma has a key, she says, but also she’s left open a window on the lower ground floor she can crawl inside. The road ends in a locked gate to the park. Richard imagines the deer in his own park asleep and dreaming. He watches Gemma go headfirst through the window; her face reappears, then, looking out at him. They wave goodbye. He shuts off the radio and turns back towards the river."

    "text": "Lu Dong moves the standing lamp, turns to gauge how far he is from the wall, then goes back to the chair he’d carefully positioned – no, never mind the chair, better to be prone on the floor. Pulling open the glass door, he steps out onto the balcony and extends a clothes-drying pole into the open air. Not heavy enough. That’s the most pressing problem – not the lamp, not the color of the floorboards, not the table in his peripheral vision distracting him from his target, but the pole’s insufficient weight.

His wife Liu Yiduo and their child are in the bedroom playing Lego. He hears his daughter say, Mama, I can’t read the plan, but I know this wheel is wrong. Lu Fan is four and a half, and can already express herself fairly well. Sometimes she uses startling metaphors. During New Year, when their neighbors were setting off fireworks high into the sky, she said, Look, Baba, the stars are breaking apart. Lu Dong keeps his child’s words locked in his heart, a whole string of quotes he’s memorized – not to repeat to anyone else, just for himself. He believes Lu Fan is an extraordinary child who will do exceptional work someday, something superlative. She could be an artist, but not just any kind of artist. No, when she’s grown, some new form of art will surely emerge – maybe she’ll sit among a crowd and spout metaphors, or wear a helmet that allows her to beam the imaginings of her mind directly onto a screen. But this speculation has to be kept under wraps for now, otherwise it’ll be like when you lift the lid off a pot of steaming rice too soon, and it seizes up half raw.

Lu Dong is a fifth-rate actor – that’s by his own ranking system. The first-rate are the big movie stars with burnished reputations who make headlines with every appearance, the ones who earn money as easily as turning on a tap. Second-rate actors are talented enough to support themselves with their craft – they have numerous films or TV series to their names, and reach deep into the human heart with every role. Third-rate actors are youngish and show potential but haven’t been in anything really good yet. People think well of them and with time, depending on personal development and luck, they might attain the first or second rank. The general public would struggle to name any fourth-rate actors, but their faces are familiar from the many TV shows they appear in, playing roles that leave no impression whatsoever. Their features are like a faded backdrop you know you’ve seen before, and as soon as they appear on-screen you feel a sort of reassurance – that’s right, this is the sort of show I’ve always watched, and here are the people who help me pass the time. So what’s a fifth-rate actor? Someone who’s been in quite a few shows, but for whatever reason – whether it’s skill or appearance – he might as well not have done any. He’s spoken many lines and been featured in many shots, but at the end of the day his screen time vanishes as cleanly as water seeping down into the earth. Then a decade passes and he’s still in the profession, never really having been out of work though he’s often just twiddling his thumbs. According to Lu Dong, this sort of actor tends to be once-divorced, and now rents an apartment in an okay location, not too far from where other screen actors live. Sometimes at the supermarket a star he’s worked with will be standing in line behind him in a face mask and dark glasses, but these stars never recognize him. He’s wanted to turn and say, Hey, remember me? That night shoot five years ago – I carried you through the woods on my back, dodging bursts of gunfire, but just as I managed to sling you onto a pony a bullet got me and I died. So far he’s only ever thought these words, paid for his groceries, then left.

It’s a Sunday morning in Beijing, and the May air is full of floating willow catkins. Lu Dong hefts the pole in his hand. His heart feels more arid than ever before. Three nights ago he had dinner with his lover, then they headed to her place. Usually he doesn’t drink much, just enough to take the edge off, but that night he had more than a glass or two because he was getting tired of her, and vice versa, probably. They both needed new partners. Alcohol loosened his tongue, and he began bragging about how he’d always get to the highest point when they played climb-the-flagpole in high school. He’d shimmy down with his legs clamped tight around the slippery pole, pleasurable in a way he couldn’t describe. He never got all the way up to the red flag, even though he was at his strongest then, his legs would always give out a couple of meters from the flag and he’d slide back down. One time it was snowing and he climbed toward the falling flakes, wearing gloves and kneepads, and he almost made it, his hand was reaching out to where the flag met the pole when a girl down below tugged at the rope and sent it flicking out to hit him in the eye. He lost his grip and fell. Broke his arm. Swiping at her phone, his lover asked if he could spend the night, but he said no, which brought an end to their nostalgia-tinged drinking session.

On the way home, the night breeze carried a vegetal scent. Outside a nightclub a man sat on the curb smoking, looking remarkably sober. The man glanced at Lu Dong’s face, then lowered his head again. A few seconds later, he called out, Hey, where do I know you from? Lu Dong had recognized him: Zhang Yu, a well-known director of arthouse films. Fifteen years ago, he’d made a small film with a budget of 300 grand with Lu Dong as the second lead, a contract killer who kept losing his wallet, a role for which he was paid 5,000 yuan. Lu Dong hadn’t put on much weight since then, though his face was now fleshier, mostly pouching beneath his eyes and on his jowls. The eyelashes that Zhang Yu had hired him for were still as resplendent as ever, reaching out like a pair of quotation marks, though the eyes they framed look smaller thanks to the pouching. It’s me, Lu Dong, he said. I was in one of your films. Oh, right, said Zhang Yu, I remember. Come, sit. Cigarette? Lu Dong smoked two packs a day so he sat down and took the proffered cigarette. It was rather mild, but the tobacco seemed to become a giant finger inside his lungs, and his face went red right away.

It was too noisy inside, Zhang Yu said, and they’re all drunk. I doubt anyone even noticed me leave. Lu Dong nodded. Zhang Yu might have won a Golden Bear and a Silver Lion, but he seemed the same as before – whether on set or in his private life, as soon as a situation bored him he’d go off on his own. He seems as shy as ever, Lu Dong thought, and just like before he gets embarrassed for other people, which causes him unnecessary pain. What are you busy with? Zhang Yu asked. Running around, Lu Dong said, taking on whatever roles I can. You married? Yes, said Lu Dong. My daughter’s four. That’s good, said Zhang Yu, I’ve been divorced twice in the last decade. The second time was like a photocopy of the first – I remember back in the day you weren’t in favor of me getting married, but I didn’t listen. Turns out you were right. You’re a good actor, you know, it’s just that you don’t fit in and there’s nothing special about your looks. But the real problem is that your desire is low and your boiling point is high. With successful actors it’s the other way round.

Lu Dong nodded and said nothing. He was well aware of where he stood, but he loved acting. That’s not the sort of thing you say out loud. True, he’d persisted till now out of love for the craft, but when you say something like that it sounds fake. Zhang Yu shook another cigarette from the pack, tapped it on his knee and said, Walk a few paces. Lu Dong stood and did as he was asked. Go a little farther, Zhang Yu said, up to that streetlight. Lu Dong kept going, suddenly realizing he ought to walk properly, as if a voice from very far away was saying, I’m begging you, take this seriously. A tender voice. Motherly, pleading. As he walked he loosened his belt, and when he reached the streetlight, he let loose a stream of piss that he’d been holding in for some time. Then he fastened his trousers and came back.

Zhang Yu indicated for him to sit again. Come be in my new film, he said. It’s a supporting role, but there’s nothing run-of-the-mill about it, a colorful part, you know what I mean? Lu Dong’s belly churned and he thought he might need to shit. Sure, he said. Thank you, Director Zhang. What’s your usual fee? Zhang Yu asked. I’m very cheap, Lu Dong said, just pay me whatever you think. Let’s go with a round number, a hundred grand, Zhang Yu said. I know that’s not a lot – maybe it’s not commensurate with your ability. I hope you don’t mind. It’s a three-month shoot in Xi’an, starting two months from now. You won’t need to learn Shaanxi dialect, we’ll film in Mandarin. I’m still working with the same crew. You’ve met most of them. They’re still in there, singing karaoke. Come back inside with me in a moment and I’ll reintroduce you. They’ve gotten older just like I have, as you’d expect. The script is adapted from a story by a Xi’an author, Han Chun. I’ll send you a copy tomorrow, along with a contract. You’ll be playing a killer again – a sharpshooter. You like noodles? I can’t remember. Frankly my digestion isn’t great, said Lu Dong, so I’m always eating noodles. Good, said Zhang Yu, go learn to cook noodles. You’ll need to have a relationship with noodles as well as with your rifle. This character treats shooting as a very serious business, like they say, ‘Where the focus lies, there you’ll find the spirit.’ Know what I mean? I’ll start practicing, said Lu Dong. I don’t need you to practice, said Zhang Yu. I need you to become the character. And you’ll need to lose a bit of weight off your face too.

The next morning Zhang Yu’s assistant sent over the short story, the script and a contract. Lu Dong hadn’t slept since he got home at three that morning. He still hadn’t said a word to Yiduo. He lay in bed, eyes wide open, not the least bit tired, worrying about all sorts of things. Out of nowhere, he started getting anxious about Zhang Yu’s health – what if he died that very day? His daughter wet the bed, and he got up to change the sheets. Lu Fan was eating candy in her dreams, her jaws working away vigorously, her little hands pawing at his face as if to remove a wrapper. The contract was pretty standard, no obvious pitfalls. After he signed it he showed it to Yiduo, then put it in the mail. For some years now, Yiduo had been running a special effects company which was doing quite well. Mostly she rendered adorable demons and scatterbrained gods. She wasn’t working that day, so she cooked him lunch and dinner, and in between she read the story and script through carefully. Lu Dong’s role was a supporting character who only appeared in one of the subplots, and though he had hardly any lines, he was in twenty-three scenes and had a distinctive personality. Most importantly the part suited Lu Dong: his character was a rather dull, emotional person who somehow kept doing the wrong thing. The story wasn’t too long, maybe 10,000 words, and the character first appeared in the following paragraph:

 

The gunman lies prone on the ground. Through his scope he can see Old Dong examining the woman’s wound, then studying the drawing on the wall. The gunman studies it along with him. It doesn’t look finished. According to his understanding of art, it’s missing the most important brushstroke. He pulls the trigger. The bullet grazes Old Dong’s throat and sinks into the wall. Now the picture’s complete. He disassembles the rifle and packs it into his rucksack, rolls up the mat, and leaves. He’s Chinese and speaks with a northern accent, but has an English name: Dick.

 

Dick only works for one man, Boss Chen, whom he met ten years ago while hunting in Africa. In the decade since he’s been given three to four jobs a year, each one lasting about two months from preparation to the actual killing. Afterwards, he leaves the country and goes wandering for half a month before coming back. Ever since Dick shot a person for the first time, he’s never again hunted an animal.

Back when he was in an acting troupe Lu Dong had fired a real gun, loaded with blanks. He no longer has access to it, and it’s illegal to buy even a fake gun online. Which is how, this early morning, Lu Dong comes to be messing around with a clothes-drying pole. In a bid to increase its weight, he wraps a bath towel around it, fastening it in place with a three-finger-wide thickness of clear tape. All morning he lies prone on his balcony. By May Beijing is already very warm. Lu Dong stares at the T-junction below. To the south of the intersection is a huge shopping mall, built fairly recently, shaped like a ship. The ground floor is all advertisements for well-known brands – the Tesla logo like an anchor sunk into a blood-red backdrop. A narrow road runs to the north, only just wide enough for two lanes of traffic, frequently mired in gridlock. To either side are small shopfronts, from hotpot restaurants to pink-curtained sex shops. This used to be a hutong, and from upstairs he can still see a public bathroom tucked away behind the shops. Further along is a gas station, bulging from the narrow road like an Adam’s apple, the main reason it gets so congested here. Lu Dong skips both breakfast and lunch. In the afternoon he lies in bed reading the script. Feeling like his brain lacks oxygen, he roots in the fridge and finds an apple, which he eats. That night he’s so hungry he can’t sleep, and he keeps belching. This contract killer isn’t a famine victim, Yiduo says. You can’t go on like this. I don’t have many lines, so the most important thing is how I look, Lu Dong says. Besides, my face is so greasy, I need to do something about it. Yiduo reaches out to stroke his cheek and says, I understand you, and our daughter does too. Today she told me she’s not going to play with you anymore, she doesn’t want to disturb you. Anyway you can’t just quit eating. Why don’t you exercise instead? I’ll dig out your running shoes tomorrow. Eat a little less, and start jogging – that’s more sustainable.

At six the next morning, while Yiduo is still in bed, Lu Dong makes himself a packet of instant noodles, finds the running shoes himself, and goes for a jog around the block. His legs feel so heavy that he doesn’t even make it out of his compound, and has to walk back looking like he’s been dredged from the water. Now he recalls the last time he exercised: six years ago. This was right after he got married to Yiduo, when they were still living on the west side of the city. He was the breadwinner then. On the weekends they’d head to the university to play badminton, then walk back hand in hand to their tiny apartment. Then Lu Fan was born, and he hasn’t exercised since. Yiduo works during the day while Lu Fan is at kindergarten, and normally Lu Dong wouldn’t be up this early. Now he heats up milk for the two of them and toasts some bread. Yiduo eats, but Lu Fan refuses – she wants to have breakfast at kindergarten. Even so, she approves of Lu Dong’s new routine. Baba, she says, this way we’ll get to spend more time together. Lu Dong now wonders why he used to sleep so much – no particular reason, it’s just that he can’t drive, so he’s not the one who takes his daughter to school. Also in sleep he feels clean, safe. No matter what troubles you have in your dreams, you can wake up from them, then ah, you’re in this empty home, everyone performing their roles, nothing goes wrong, no one sees through him, he lies alone in the soft bed as if he’s only just been born. He is afraid of sweet dreams, fears their falseness, fears the moment of waking and realizing he must still endure this happy life, fears understanding that he has committed every conceivable crime but lacks the courage to take responsibility, and that no one even wants him to be held accountable. Before they head out he hugs Yiduo and Lu Fan, lightly grazing his daughter’s face with his stubble, feeling both the rightness and regret within this gesture.

After they leave, Lu Dong eats the rest of the bread, takes up his pole again, and resumes his prone position on the balcony. This time round he finds a rug to lean on – actually Lu Fan’s bath towel from when she was two, now too small for her, but exactly the right size to cushion his elbows so they stop aching. A tripod would be useful, something to rest the rifle on, but there’s nothing like that in the apartment, so he grabs some books from the shelf and places those beneath the barrel.

For the next half-hour or so he keeps his eyes fixed on a woman, probably a nanny, leading an enormous black hound on a leash. Its head is the size of a bucket, brown collar as respectable as a necktie, while the woman is scrawny, short-necked and short-limbed, scurrying along ahead of the dog, which keeps stopping. When it extrudes two thick logs of shit, she wraps them in a Kleenex and, looking around to make sure no one’s watching, quickly trots over to the ornamental pond in the center of their compound and flings them in. A boy about Lu Fan’s age spots the dog, jumps off his skateboard, and insists on clambering onto the dog’s back. The dog goes along with it, even half kneeling to help the boy get on. The boy’s mother arrives and scoops him up. The dog licks her ankle, and the mother shrieks. She takes off running with the boy in her arms. Lu Dong aims his rifle at the mother’s head, keeping his sights trained on her until she vanishes into another building. When he turns back the dog is gone too, and all he can see is the wind shaking the compound’s peach trees, scattering blossoms.

Gazing into the distance, his eyes land on the metro station outside the mall. It’s surging with people, the dense crowd like churning slurry. A lone man pushes his way out, one of the very few exiting rather than entering. He crosses the road and goes to the window counter of a grocery store, buys a pack of cigarettes, then heads toward Lu Dong’s compound. He is about Lu Dong’s age, a little thinner with a receding hairline that reveals two patches of pale forehead scalp. Light blue jacket and black sweatpants. Lu Dong aims the rifle at him. The man stops outside the compound, rips open the pack and starts to smoke. Seeing him like this through the railings, Lu Dong imagines him as a criminal. What is he here for? Perhaps to steal some rich man’s lover. Quite a few mistresses live in this compound, he knows, alone in large apartments. They wear lipstick even if they’re just going to the supermarket, sleep all day and all night too. But no, Lu Dong reminds himself, he’s meant to be a killer, why would a killer murder a criminal? Outlaws aren’t like actors, who readily turn against members of their own profession. Okay, so maybe this guy is a plain-clothes police officer who’s been tailing Lu Dong for a couple of years now, and has finally tracked down where he lives. Take one more step and you’re dead, Lu Dong whispers to himself. The man drops his cigarette butt and saunters back the way he came.

A strong wind starts up around noon. The old people resting their legs in the courtyard and the nannies with their young charges all disappear. Bereft of targets, Lu Dong dozes off. When he wakes up, he feels despair – how could a professional killer fall asleep at his post like this? He stands up and gets some cold milk from the fridge, then wanders around the apartment. There are no toy guns anywhere. If only Lu Fan were a boy, he thinks. He texts Yiduo: If it’s convenient, could you pick up a toy rifle on your way home? Ideally more than a meter long with a scope. He reads the story again. It’s very short, and lacks detail. After Boss Chen’s death Dick keeps working, and in fact most of the narrative is about this period of his life: after lying low for a while, he begins taking out men who urinate in public. Lu Dong reads the script again, which doesn’t provide any more insight into Dick’s motivation. Shooting public urinators doesn’t earn him any money, and it takes quite a lot of effort. Boss Chen used to tell him the time, place and target, and all he had to do was find a good vantage point, lie in wait, open fire, and escape. It’s not like he can just wait in the same place with his sights trained on a utility pole, because it would be too easy to find him by following the bullet’s trajectory. He’d need to spot an offender, follow him, and take him out when he’s not actually peeing. Maybe he’d be stepping out of a local supermarket or waiting for his kids at the kindergarten gate when the bullet enters his brain from some distant window. Lu Dong texts Zhang Yu:

 

Sir, I’d like to know more about Dick’s psychology – who are his parents? Who does he love? Does he prefer tea or Coca-Cola? Does he sleep on his back or his side? After killing someone, does he go for noodles or have a shower? Most importantly, why does he shoot people who urinate in public? Is he a radical environmentalist? Or does he have trouble peeing? Sorry to bother you, any tips you can share would be a great help.

 

Zhang Yu doesn’t immediately reply.

Lu Dong has a shower, then goes through the script and looks at Dick’s lines, all twelve of them:

 

1. A pack of Esse cigarettes, please. Green, not blue. No, not that one, give me the one third row down, fifth from the left.

2. (on the phone) Okay, got it. What kind of lion? Where did it bite you? Please tell your wife I’m broken up about this. I’ll never contact you again.

3. See where I’m pointing? Walk down this road. After the first junction, you’ll see a Japanese elementary school. Don’t turn, keep going straight. At the second junction, there’ll be a congee shop on your right. Turn toward it and keep going about 500 meters to the massage parlor. That’s the place you want. The masseur isn’t actually blind, he just keeps his eyes shut.

4. I don’t like the noodles you made today. I can tell you’re in a bad mood – they’re all clumping together.

5. This is a you problem, not a me problem. Know the difference. Maybe one day my problems will become your problems, but you should pray that day never comes.

6. People envy birds because they can fly, but I don’t. I can shoot them out of the sky anytime I want. I envy the flowing river. You can’t stop a river. Even if you build a dam, you haven’t stopped the river, it’s just waiting.

7. Wrong number.

8. There seems to be a misunderstanding. I hope that’s a business issue, and nothing personal. If I’ve accidentally attracted your attention, that’s because you’re too sensitive. People die in this world every single day. You need to be less sensitive.

9. And another thing, where’d the noodle shop go?

10. Peeing in public is a dangerous business. I’m telling you this because you have two kids. Look up. That thing is called the sun. It shines down on you and fills each day with warmth. You shouldn’t be living like this. Build yourself a nice bathroom in your house, and go enjoy it whenever you feel the urge to pee. Pass this habit on to your children.

11. Go ahead, study me, put me under the microscope. Your hearts are dead. What good could a microscope do you?

12. Could the person who shot me step forward? Hi, my name’s Dick, what’s your name?

 

Lu Dong goes through all these lines, underlining them in pencil, reciting them three times each. Dick’s dialogue is odd – a series of non sequiturs that mostly go unanswered. Not really dialogue at all. Dick doesn’t do conversation. Right at the end, the person whose name Dick asks for – an anonymous foot soldier – doesn’t even get the chance to step out from his hiding place and speak before Dick dies. Naturally a vigilante who goes around shooting public pissers has to die, but it makes Lu Dong sad to see him end this way. It feels tragic. Hi, my name’s Dick, what’s your name? He reads it twice more, finds the rhythm of the line. No sorrow at his life ending. He just wants to understand this man. What’s your name? Lu Dong stands before the mirror, staring at his own face. What’s your name? He makes one corner of his lip twitch up, keeps his eyebrows level, tries to look composed. This is how he’ll do it. All of a sudden, he feels he can do the performance justice, or at least this line, his interpretation makes sense, and if someone were to call action right now, he’s confident everyone would be satisfied with the take.

His phone pings. Zhang Yu:

 

Just back from swimming. These questions aren’t easy to answer. You know me, if I could think clearly I wouldn’t make movies. Forgive me, but actually I’m not sure these questions are important. If you think they are, then please take responsibility for them. I’ll give you a tip though: you don’t hate your target, but rather you’ve thought about it rationally and have decided that the world would be a better place if he didn’t exist. You’re not a foot soldier, because foot soldiers always take the country’s side. You’re someone who rearranges the world all by yourself, like the great Lei Feng, not bound by ethics, a small-time intellectual. Take care.

 

Lu Dong responds with an OK and thumbs up emoji. He thinks he understands.

That evening, Yiduo comes home bearing a toy gun with a scope, though no tripod, and the scope is merely decorative, all he can see through it is gray plastic, while the bullets are plastic orange pellets. You could shoot someone in the face with these and not injure them. In other words, the gun is as harmless as a ping-pong ball dispenser, but at least it has a trigger. A little later, they take Lu Fan out for pizza. She loves Western food and can polish off half a nine-inch pizza and a fillet steak all by herself, but she’s not fat. It’s as if she was born with the ability to transform Western food into water and carbon dioxide. Back at home, Lu Dong tells his daughter the story of the tyrannosaurus rex, a carnivore who falls into a deep gully where there’s nothing to eat. A fox falls in love with him and gathers fruit for him each day, and he survives. When the T-rex finally gets out and returns to the forest he goes back to eating other animals, but whenever he encounters a fox he hesitates and flips a coin to decide if he should eat it. Most of the time, the coin gives him the outcome he desires.

For the next few days, Lu Dong rehearses by himself, taking care of his daughter at night so Yiduo can finish up her work. He wakes up at six each morning to make breakfast for his wife and child. At night, after Lu Fan has gone to bed, he goes downstairs for a jog around the compound in an attempt to reduce the excess flesh on his body and face. Dick only smokes half a pack a day, so Lu Dong does the same. Never more or less, ten cigarettes exactly. Now and then he feels a surge of desire for his lover, but the task ahead of him quickly tamps that down. For the first time in five years his feelings are more or less pure. A week later, he knows all Dick’s lines by heart, he has a plan for the blocking of each scene, and he’s come up with a gesture that isn’t in the script: before he fires his gun, Dick sticks his right index finger into his ear, then touches that same finger to the trigger. At least two of his meals each day are noodles, sometimes takeout, sometimes homemade. After the first week, he notices a tiny new restaurant by the T-junction that serves Shanxi noodles. Their cleanliness is only so-so but the noodles are tasty, and so he begins going there at lunchtime for a bowl of knife-cut noodles. On the tenth night, he dreams of Dick lurking behind a window in the distance, taking aim while he pees by the side of the road. Dick touches his finger to his ear and shoots him dead.

A beautiful nightmare.

On the twenty-third day, as if making a daily visit to church, Lu Dong lies prone on his balcony. The man in the blue jacket appears again at the compound gate. Lu Dong aims the toy gun at his head. A nanny returns from buying groceries and uses her keycard to enter the compound, and the man slips in behind her. Today he is carrying a red rucksack. He walks over to one of the benches by the pond and sits down, gazing around, staring at the koi in the water. It’s a sunny day and the pond is glittering. The man sits there quite a while, then seems to remember something, and reaches into his rucksack for a baseball cap, which he puts on, casting a shadow over his face. Lu Dong points the gun at the center of the cap. The man folds his arms and stares into space. A few residents bring their children to play by the pond. The kids point at the water and seem to say something. One of them sticks a leg in and his mother smacks him. Someone tosses breadcrumbs to the koi, who surge over to snap them up, like petals on a flower. Lu Dong is getting thirsty but stays put. He thinks to himself, if you don’t move, neither will I. A half-hour passes. A nanny in her forties pushes a stroller up to the pond. In the stroller is a set of twins, each sleeping in their own little seat. Lu Dong has never seen this nanny or this stroller. Probably the family just moved in, or the babies were born recently. Not talking to anyone, the nanny parks the stroller by the water and settles onto a bench to bask in the sun. Time passes. A boy drops his water pistol into the pond and the wind blows it into the center. Several parents come over but they aren’t able to retrieve it. The nanny stands and seems to be suggesting something. At this moment, the man in the baseball cap quickly walks over to the stroller, places something onto one of the seats, and briskly leaves through the gate.

A bomb? Lu Dong is about to shout down at them but shakes his head. What if it’s not a bomb? What if it’s a flyer for an early education center? Shyness and anxiety do battle in his heart. Finally he gets up, changes into a clean shirt, and takes the elevator down. By the time he gets to the lake there is no sign of the nanny or the twins. The little boy’s father is scooping up the water pistol with a pool skimmer. Lu Dong looks up at his balcony, where the gun is still propped up and pointing in this direction. He leaves through the gate and makes a round of the perimeter, but there is no sign of the man. Could he have dozed off ? Maybe everything he just saw was a dream. At the supermarket, he buys a pack of cigarettes: A pack of Esse cigarettes, please. Green, not blue. No, not that one, give me the one third row down, fifth from the left. The clerk says, What? Lu Dong thinks maybe he didn’t hear and repeats the entire line. The clerk says, Sir, we’re out of Esse. Look, the shelf’s empty. Lu Dong nods and gets some chewing gum instead.

Back home he sits in the study, puts some eyedrops in his eyes, shuts them, and has a rest. Time for noodles, he thinks, but he’s a little tired, and all of a sudden he misses Lu Fan. If only she could show up now and say she’s back early because something happened at kindergarten. Now he understands that concentration equals loneliness. He opens his eyes and returns to the balcony. The nanny and twin stroller are back by the pond. He senses the tick tick of a timer. He ought to have eliminated that man earlier, he realizes. What a slip-up. This could be a micro-bomb, no thicker than a human hair. Or something even more advanced, a see-through bomb. You’d never spot that before it exploded, yet it might be powerful enough to decimate an entire building. He should have known, from the first moment he set eyes on the man, that he was the sort who brings wickedness to the world. Lu Dong was the only one who noticed, and now he’s let him get away.

He checks the time on his phone and sees a text from Zhang Yu’s production manager:

 

Director Zhang Yu drowned while swimming at three o’clock this afternoon. The film has been canceled, and your contract is now invalid. More details to follow. We are all shocked and saddened. Legal proceedings against the swimming pool have begun. Our condolences. Be well.

 

It’s six o’clock. Lu Dong calls Yiduo but she doesn’t pick up. Then he remembers she’s taken Lu Fan to her piano lesson, and is having dinner with some of the other parents. His heart judders like an airplane plummeting, plummeting, still not reaching the ground. He thinks to himself, This is a you problem, not a me problem. Know the difference. Maybe one day my problems will become your problems, but you should pray that day never comes. And another problem, the timer in his head is still going tick tick, not pausing for a second. He steps out onto the balcony. The sun is beginning to set, and there are more people gathering downstairs – children, adults, dogs, people with kites, skateboards, water pistols shaped like animal heads. He sees the nanny sitting next to the twin stroller, one leg hoisted onto the other, snacking on melon seeds from her handkerchief. The man in the baseball cap is on a nearby bench, still wearing his red rucksack, hands clasped, head lowered. Lu Dong goes into the kitchen and gets a knife, a couple of handspans long with a sharp point. He wraps this in newspaper, tucks it under his arm, and gets the elevator down. By the time he’s reached the pond the man is nowhere to be seen. Whirling around, he spots the man walking out of the compound gate. Lu Dong swats the handkerchief out of the nanny’s hand and says, There’s something in your stroller, get the kids out quick. With that he chases after the man, but there’s no sign of him. He remembers that he first saw him approach from the T-junction and heads that way, pausing a few seconds when he reaches the noodle shop, or rather where the noodle shop used to be, it’s gone now, in its place a roller shutter with a microscope painted on it.

Lu Dong sprints through the crowds surging up from the subway station and catches up with the man in the middle of the intersection. He knocks him to the ground. Lu Dong puts the point of the knife to his throat and says, What did you put in the stroller? The man says, What stroller? The twins’ stroller, Lu Dong says, And another thing, where did the noodle shop go? What noodle shop? Lu Dong says, There used to be one on the street back there, where’d it go? Oh, you mean the Shanxi noodle place, the man says, I’ve been wondering that too. Lu Dong sticks a finger into his ear with his free hand, allowing the knife point to skate across the man’s throat. Don’t change the subject. What did you put in the stroller? A rag doll, the man says. What’s inside it? Lu Dong says. Rags, obviously. An Audi speeds by, honking loudly. Why did you put the rag doll in there? I miss my children, the man says. That’s why I did it. I have two daughters, but I know something’s wrong with me, something unforgivable, and I’ll never see them again. Go ahead and stab me dead, solve all my problems, though you’ll only be creating problems for yourself. Lu Dong abruptly feels air swirling up from his chest, leaving through his mouth, his nose, his ears, while at the same time his flesh creeps downwards. A weightless distant spirit takes hold of his legs, and he can’t stop himself from falling over. He drops the knife and sits beside the man amid the flowing traffic, and he looks up into the distance where perhaps someone is taking aim at him, judgment for all the wrongs he’s done since he was born. But so what? The man pats him on the shoulder and says, You take life too seriously, don’t you? Lu Dong says nothing. He can see a river not far from here, rippling beneath the thronging twilit crowds, the water completely clear, fish darting through it, lush with aquatic plants, no thought of sluice gates, no fear of bullets, flowing all the way to the vast ocean.

    "text": "In the years before his stroke, just how many times had her father told a woman he loved her after dating for two or three weeks? He said it to her cat the moment he set eyes on it, when she took it out of the carrier on one of her visits. ‘I love you, cat’. The word that most surprised her, when he first used it, shortly after becoming a widower, was ‘sweetheart’. He’d never called his wife that; their romantic language had matured with time, and he never employed any of their usual terms of endearment with anyone else. The women he began to date were ‘sweethearts’ from the start and he even used it to refer to Adriana on the phone. ‘How are you doing, sweetheart?’ ‘Hugs and kisses, sweetheart!’ She felt like one of his online partners and wondered how many hours he spent on his cell phone for it to become a habit to call even his daughter ‘sweetheart’.

During those years, her father had interminable conversations with women. Whole mornings, afternoons, evenings, and sometimes even nights were spent offloading the story of his life into the ears of these women, some of whom appeared on Meetic profiles with their heads cropped so they wouldn’t be recognized. In addition to ‘sweetheart’, there was the ‘This time I think I’ve found the one for me’. ‘What’s-her-name is a darling, I think she’s the one for me,’ he’d told Adriana on ten, twenty, thirty occasions, with the phone or computer at hand, ready to start a new conversation with the next headless woman. ‘Just in case,’ he always replied when she objected to the contradiction involved in saying he’d found the one for him and then immediately linking up with someone else.

What does ‘I love you’ mean? What did he mean by it? Soon those words, uttered as casually as you might say, ‘Take care of yourself’ or pinch the chubby cheeks of the neighbor’s baby, began to litter more intimate conversations. None of those online attachments had lasted: when he didn’t break things off with them, the women broke off with him. ‘Have you split up with Menganita?’ Adriana would ask. ‘Oh, don’t mention her! What a pain she was!’ he’d answer, or ‘What a busybody!’ or ‘That one? I’m better off without her’ or ‘We have almost nothing in common’ or even ‘She’s a simple-minded woman with little experience of life.’ And then there were the ‘We have nothing to talk about’ and the ‘I found her really boring’. But not long before, in a kind of shallow expression of devotion, he’d told those women he loved them. It wasn’t that he was intentionally lying; those I-love-yous expressed a hope, the possibility of loving that person in the future. The majority of them had played along, taking things just as lightly, as if by a certain age they’d become immune, or were harking back to old-fashioned ways of hooking up, when words of love functioned as common euphemisms for sexual encounters.

He’d started dating the middle-aged women he met on Meetic as a slightly befuddled way of ensuring old age wouldn’t find him alone, particularly when he was experiencing a sudden, happy, second youth. He had nineteen partners in four years; his ‘partners’ were anyone he’d been with for more than a month. That was part of his happiness. The story wasn’t that he was desperately seeking someone to be with and had tried nineteen times, but that he’d dated all those ‘girls’. He called them girls, a word that was totally juvenile, just like his own soul.

He waited a whole summer before cutting loose, the exact amount of time that Adriana spent with him in Valencia after her mother’s death. Her funeral had been held on July 9, under a scorching sun, and seeing him so vulnerable for the first time, she’d decided to stay until the end of September. Three depressing months of cloying Mediterranean humidity that they spent looking at photos and arranging for family members and her mother’s friends to come choose items of clothing. Well, in fact, she was the one dividing up belongings while her father was driving around the city on a Vespa at sunset, whenever there was a bit of a breeze. The only area he took charge of was organizing the paperwork during interminable mornings of bureaucracy. They each made a will to avoid problems if the other died. At night they went to some small beachfront chiringuito, although Adriana was irritated by the number of people the cruise ships had been disgorging in recent years into a city that, during her childhood and adolescence, hadn’t been on the tourism map. Back then, Malvarrosa had had a scruffy, dilapidated air she’d loved. But it had been a long time since the former spa hotel of Las Arenas, with all its simple elegance, was converted into a flashy beachside complex and the whole esplanade had become a succession of packed terrace bars serving mediocre food for guiris, as the foreign tourists were known, with sangria and loud, cheesy music.

The only thing her father did that summer was sign up on Meetic at the advice of a friend. He’d log on at night to chat for a while, but nothing more. No dates. He was still feeling too dazed by his widowhood and was seeking consolation in friends and his two older sisters, Asela and Piluca. They were retired, living in Santa Pola, near Alicante, and invited him to visit on weekends. Took him to lunch or dinner, or spent the day with him on the beach. Her father hated getting sand in his clothes and would stay in the chiringuito, watching the others take dips in the sea, roast in the sun, and apply high-protection sunscreen that left their skin as white as corpses. Adriana declined most of her aunts’ invitations. She’d figured one thing out: however much they wanted to, they were incapable of consoling one other, first because they each needed to grieve alone and then, more importantly, because the journey through mourning necessitated a common horizon, was a shared project, and that was impossible; she had her boring life as a PhD student with a scholarship at a Madrid university, and her father was throwing himself into, as they say, remaking his life, which implied meeting someone in a similar situation with the desire to confront the final stretch with company, as he definitely didn’t want to face that stage alone. The only way he could find meaning in things, in himself, was through sharing his days with a woman. He used to talk to her at great length about it, perhaps believing that doing so would ensure a positive outcome. His task now, he insisted, was to meet a sensible person, capable of commitment. The repetition left room for skepticism since what is taken as a given doesn’t need to be alluded to so frequently. And, in fact, her father didn’t take anything for granted; there was an underlying sense of doubt. She didn’t know if his misgivings stemmed from fear of not complying with his own plans, from not trusting them or himself, or from the fact that he simply hadn’t yet come to terms with the death of his wife.

The fun and games started in October. She was back in Madrid and her father began emailing her photos of the women he was flirting with or dating. ‘What do you think to this one?’ he’d ask. Then they both bought smartphones and downloaded WhatsApp so it was her cell phone rather than her Gmail inbox that was filled with images of women in their late fifties and early sixties. It was important to him that she give the thumbs-up to the person’s physique, not so much in terms of a slender figure, beautiful eyes, or gym-sculpted muscles, but something more subtle in the whole look, as if an infallible capacity for commitment – his obsession – could be inferred from an impeccable appearance.

The first woman he dated was Quela, a widow from Massanassa who owned orange orchards and gave Adriana a bracelet; in her free time, the woman made jewelry from pieces of wood, shells and zircon. She never saw her again because her father broke off the relationship after a few weeks, arguing that she had a jealous streak. Then came the slightly younger Araceli, who lived in Sagunto and was the spitting image of Jacqueline Kennedy. Her father broke off that too, this time because it was impossible to go out to restaurants with her – she hated all the dishes and hardly spoke a word. She was followed by Mari Carmen, Amparo, Roser and Delfina, all from Valencia, all blonde and standoffish, and none of whom lasted more than a month. They left him before he tired of them. For his next date, he went farther afield, to the home of a certain Nines in Castellón, where he planned to spend five days. Nines was a head taller than her father and twice his weight. In her photo, she looked on the large side, had dyed red hair and was wearing purple lipstick and eyeshadow. Nines, who was also widowed, introduced him to her children, made plans for his vacations, loaned him an SUV, and firmly believed that she’d found the man she wanted to end her days with. Somewhat overwhelmed, he soon set her straight on that point. And then she stalked him. When her father blocked her calls and emails, Nines found Adriana’s Facebook page and left messages for her: ‘Your father is the man for me’; ‘No woman could ever love him more than I do.’

Adriana was surprised that people in their sixties still had romantic illusions, that women with children and marriages behind them could believe it possible to be in love with someone after knowing them for five days. Or was it a kind of regression? Maybe desperation led them to unlearn, to deny everything experience had taught them. Was it possible not to learn anything? Maybe there was absolutely nothing to learn. That idea was spine-chilling. Or maybe it was just Nines; all the others had a more realistic sense of what love was. Usually, there was practicality on both sides: they were looking for company, friendship, but there was no form of passion or sentimentality involved, just a mutual checking out. Moreover, he tended to avoid what he called the ‘unbalanced’ ones: women who were over-the-top in some way, excessively bad-humored, excessively sporty, excessively sensitive. He had no regrets about dropping Nines, nor Lourdes, her successor, who said she was separated from her husband but still lived in the same house as him, and who then moved into her father’s apartment without ever being invited. One night, she cooked croquettes for him and her father got a bad stomachache. Adriana’s aunt Piluca called her immediately:

‘The woman is trying to poison him!’

That episode made him more cautious. He continued meeting all the Nurias, Cristinas, Ángeles, Lauras and Consuelos who were happy to have a beer with him, but if it went beyond that, he’d wait weeks before inviting them home. If he particularly liked the woman, he’d suggest a weekend in some nearby hotel.

Although he still kept her regularly updated on his connections, Adriana lost track. During her visits, she’d sit behind him at the computer to look at all those ‘beheadeds’, as she called them, although, in fact, as he explained, they were in the minority: he knew from experience that only the ones who were married or shy hid their faces, and he’d stopped dating them, which didn’t stop her from continuing to call them all ‘beheadeds’ just to bug him.

She wasn’t concerned about his juvenile lifestyle. He’d spent the last years diligently caring for his beloved, ailing wife, and before that, over thirty years taking orders from that same sergeant-major of a wife, with equal parts diligence and unconditional love. It had never occurred to him that he’d survive her. A constant source of irritation for Adriana, though, was the amount of money he was spending. In just a few months, he’d gone through his modest savings; sometimes he didn’t have enough to see him through the month and would have to ask one of his sisters for a loan. ‘What if something happens to you? You’ve got nothing to fall back on,’ Adriana began to say. ‘What if the air conditioning breaks down, or the television, or your car, or all of them give up the ghost at the same time?’ she’d protest at each visit. ‘When I win my case against Social Security and they pay my full pension, I’ll be more comfortable,’ he’d reply. ‘And I’ve cut down on a lot of expenses, but I need to find a partner.’ ‘And can’t these women pay their share? They have their own money. Fuck it, this is the twentieth century. Why do you have to come off all manly?’ Her father would shrug his shoulders, which for him was equivalent to an absolute refusal, even if he did know he was in the wrong. He was about to turn seventy and came from a generation where men had to pay to seduce, particularly on the first date. And that was the problem: he rarely got past the first date. When she reminded him of that, he’d be despondent because not only was he leaking money like water, but it was also confirmation of his advancing years.

The apartment had gradually become a labyrinth.

It was large, very old-fashioned, and cluttered with things inherited from her mother’s side of the family: tapestries, rugs, revolving bookcases, ceramicware from all around the peninsula, several boxes of antique silver cutlery, porcelain dinner services, huge crystal chandeliers, paintings, prints, African carvings, Lladró figurines, wall clocks, chairs, armchairs, occasional tables, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves in three rooms containing the complete library of the only ancestor with intellectual pretensions, who died celibate, having accumulated enough culture for several generations. The whole place was an expression of horror vacui; it needed constant attention, which had formerly been provided by Teresa, who came to clean. Now, whenever Adriana happened to be there on one of her days, Teresa would take her aside to say, ‘Can’t you persuade your father to throw out some of the papers in his study? It’s impossible to tidy in there!’ Or, ‘Can’t you persuade him to clear out the attic, take the rugs to be cleaned, dust the chandeliers, to at least throw something out?’ Her father was having none of it. Adriana knew Teresa was wondering why she didn’t do it, why his daughter didn’t use her visits to bring a little order to the chaos. But she’d already thrown out enough stuff when her mother died, had spent whole months clearing the junk rooms, donating books to libraries, listing white elephants on Wallapop, until she’d had more than enough, and her aunts advised her that she shouldn’t go around cheerfully offloading things that, according to them, were very valuable. ‘Why don’t you have them auctioned?’ they said. ‘You’ll need the money,’ a distant cousin warned one day. There was a hint of vengeance in her words. They could no longer count on her mother’s generous salary as a pediatrician. What’s more, although Adriana doubted the value of all those possessions, something was holding her back. She was done with breaking her back. She resolved to do as little as possible, but then the embolism came along, multiplying the number of things she had to take charge of, leaving even less time for all the paintings, tapestries, fabrics, dinner services, silverware, books and counterpanes belonging to great-grandmothers and their mothers, and the mountain of papers, and the cluttered junk rooms. Her father’s health became her main, and at times only, concern. Lady Death and Lady Manipulator – two deities of the darkness that had begun to surround her during her mother’s illness – took all her energy, and then she felt like those devices that control people’s activities, giving a warning whenever they stray from a healthy lifestyle: ‘You haven’t worked out for two weeks’; ‘Your blood pressure is higher’; ‘Your pulse is faster today’; ‘Have you taken your medication?’; ‘Have you stopped smoking?’ Yet, not even after his stroke did her father think about death, or the possibility that he might not fully recover. But he did, on the other hand, think about how hard it was going to be to find a partner now that he had one useless hand, a walker, and a pace not much faster than a snail’s."

    "text": "Time seems to slip by without leaving even the slightest trace on her body. There is no way of guessing her age, but her thin, supple body, glowing white skin, and clearly defined features all make her look like a young woman still in the prime of her youth. The most telling details lie in her expression – that mildly amused look so common among young girls. The edges of her mouth tilt slightly upwards, as do her eyes, that’s one of the reasons her expression is so distinctive. Her face is nearly devoid of wrinkles; even when she smiles the skin on her face remains smooth and even, with the exception of a hint of crow’s feet. But even those tiny lines seem to accentuate the natural curvature of her eyes, increasing her allure. There is nothing aged about her appearance – she doesn’t even seem to have fully matured – she looks more like a girl in the spring of youth. It is hard to believe. Could she really be that young? There is something about her that gradually reveals the passage of time. Once those tiny details emerge, they quickly multiply. Beneath her supple body, glowing skin, and perfectly manicured appearance there is something frozen and fixed. It is difficult to express. Nothing changes, but it is as if more and more is added to her, layer upon layer. Who knows? Perhaps at some point her appearance will actually begin to transform. That’s why, while everyone repeatedly remarks ‘how young she looks’, between the lines, what they are saying is that her youth has passed.

There is no way of guessing her real age; it’s impossible to tell. She is obviously past the age most women get married – she clearly passed that point a long time ago. This is clear because there is something pure and simple about her – there is no trace of passion left. This purity is frozen and therefore very different from the purity one sees in a young girl. A young girl’s purity is chaotic, tangled, prickly, overflowing from all kinds of unfamiliar experiences. After a certain number of years, that youthful purity hardens, eventually transforming into something resembling a fossil. It is from the preserved youthful appearance of someone like her that the ravages of time are seen clearly, even more clearly than on a face with typical signs of aging. Those fluid elements also reveal a kind of vitality and over time they gnaw away at one’s muscles and skin, transforming the face’s makeup and shape. They also bring a kind of ugliness, but that imbues the person with a livelier personality. This kind of personality always has the qualities of youth. It is due to the restless nature of youth that one’s appearance is twisted, contorted, and left coarse.

It would be wrong to say she hasn’t experienced life. Instead, it would be more apt to describe her as someone whom time has slipped by without leaving the slightest trace. She has always grown, but never seemed to really grow up. When she crooks her head to the side as she pops dried banana chips or dried orange slices into her mouth, she still seems like a young girl. The way the corners of her eyes and mouth curl up when she smiles makes her look like a teenager. Her pitch black hair, devoid of even a single strand of gray, hangs straight down to her waist, and is kept in place by an oversized handkerchief, which is loosely tied. If she’s a young girl, she’s an old fashioned one; this was the fashion for young girls who came from humble family circumstances roughly twenty years ago. The style was everywhere, indoors and out, in the longtang alley neighborhoods and out on the main boulevards. It was a style that developed partially out of laziness. She may be a young girl, but a young girl from two decades past. Whenever she goes out, she always applies a few sprays of perfume to her handkerchief, fan, and behind her ears. When she attends lavish events, she wears a black, silk cheongsam and a pair of high-heeled shoes which extend her petite frame, accentuating her long, slender figure. A crimson shawl embroidered with peach blossoms and a small handbag inlaid with pearls give her the appearance of a virtuous maiden reincarnated from another world. She swims through the sea of time, never resisting its current. Resistance would have left behind scars. This is another reason why time has left no scratch on her.

However, despite appearances, she hasn’t emerged from a fairytale. She attended elementary school, middle school, graduated during the Cultural Revolution, and was unemployed for a period of time before finally finding a job as a bookkeeper for a kindergarten. These historical periods more or less reveal her true age. But who would ever believe that? The difference between her real age and her perceived one is several decades. No one ever dares ask her to her face, but behind her back they are constantly whispering to one another: How old is she? If she ever happens to overhear them she always turns and, with a smile, declares: I’m an old lady! There is something unreconcilable between her smile and an old lady’s; it feels so unnatural, yet there is something that leaves you with no choice but to believe what she says is true. Frankly, there is something dark and strange about this smiling ‘old lady’. But things are often strange like that. In situations like this, it seems to no longer be an issue of whether or not she is young or pretty, it is something else . . . but what that could be is not clear.

No one understands anything about her life; that’s not because of the complexity of her lifestyle, but the opposite – its overly simplistic nature. It is so simple that it is almost beyond comprehension. She has always lived with just one other person – her mother. The identity of her father – whether he passed away or left them, and, if he had left them, where he had gone – is a mystery that no one knows the answer to. And no one cares to ask. Back during that era, the early 1950s, things could have gone either way. Whatever happened was likely a product of the times, a moment of revolutionary change, where it was quite common for families to have both heads chopped off. In those crowded old-style longtang neighborhoods, how many confused children growing up in single-parent homes had the urge to search for their missing parents?

But she did have a mother, so what about her? Most would say that a mother-daughter living together was a nice, small family unit – simple, stable, and peaceful. The daughter had someone to raise her when she was a child and the mother would have someone to care for her when she grew old. Without the constant bickering of a husband and wife, or sibling rivalries, the relationship between a mother and daughter takes on a sisterly dynamic – they are perfect companions for each other.

Indeed, her mother looks more like her older sister than her actual mother. She too has a slender, petite body, alluring eyes, and a fair complexion. The way she dresses is also quite appealing. And, just like her daughter, she too looks much younger than her age. However, given a certain period has past, the accumulation of time has pushed down on that frozen core inside her to the point that her external appearance has finally changed. This change manifests itself with a tendency to shrink and contract, and not with growing thin or developing wrinkles; her skin remains clear and well-cared for, but slightly darkened and not as radiant as before. Her mother is better read than her and, if nothing else, she experienced the changes a woman goes through when she gets married and has children; these are experiences that transform time’s quality and leave their mark. This is why her mother’s eyes reveal a worldliness and the relaxed sensibility of someone finally at home with herself after everything she has experienced. This alone gives her a dimension her daughter is lacking. It also explains why she is, ever so slightly, better looking than her daughter. But when it comes down to it, mother and daughter are quite similar – after all they share the same genes and same detached air that allows their experience to leave less of an mark on them than most people. Mother may indeed be an old lady, but a youthful one; both pretty and lively. Next to her daughter, they were indeed like sisters.

Mother and daughter even dressed in almost identical fashion. As a little girl, her mother dressed her up as a delicate young maiden, braiding her long hair and putting it up in a bun. She wore a camel-wool cotton-padded jacket with woven brocade sleeves and toggle buttons, which her mother made from leftover scraps of fabric. She matched her jacket with her mother’s old Savile Row-style trousers, which her mother had altered, by widening the ankles with a patch of cowhide. The look was completed with a pair of leather shoes with faux-squirrel fur around the opening. When mother and daughter went out together, they were the image of two elegant women. By the time she was thirteen or fourteen, she was already as tall as her mother and had begun to develop her own opinions about the world. Mother and daughter began to visit the silk shop where, after much haggling, they would return home with all the materials to make new clothing. When it came to ready-made outfits, the two of them would pick out clothes with only slight variations so they would match whenever they went out together. During this period of her life, her style was a bit old-fashioned, but only because she was imitating her mother’s. This phase lasted long into her teenage years. That was back during the days of the Cultural Revolution when the prevalent street fashion veered towards the rustic; those peasant and worker uniforms of the day came off as a bit dramatic. It was popular for girls at the time to wear male-style military outfits such as wide-legged trousers, leather belts, and shirts buttoned all the way up to the collar. Mother and daughter resembled refugees of time who had been locked away in a small garret since the last century. They made slight adjustments to their trousers, widening their pant legs to the accepted six inches. They also removed the lace and embroidery from their shirts, eliminating all the symbols of decadence and rot from their old-style clothing. Yet they managed to find a way to express their sense of fashion in private. At the time, there were all kinds of embroidery styles, like the Albanian stitch, being quietly passed around. As soon as they came home, mother and daughter would ascend to the garret and remove their outer garments to reveal brightly colored sweaters with unique patterns. Gradually, their true age began to blur and fade; you could describe them as ‘gorgeous’ or a ‘pair of beauties’, but they were outdated, out of step with the era they lived in. This was especially the case for her. This was, after all, her era. And yet, not only did she fail to keep up with what was happening, but regressed into the past. By this time, she had graduated high school; it was probably the time in which young students were all mobilized up to the mountains and down to the countryside as part of the Rustication Movement, yet mother and daughter never considered it. Knowing that this widowed mother and only child had only each other, her school and the neighborhood committee didn’t press hard to separate them; instead, her name was added to the list awaiting employment allocation. In any case, her mother already had a job as a cashier at the district food company and they never felt that living off her mother’s single salary was a burden. During the period that she was waiting for employment, mother and daughter became obsessed with crocheted lace. Every season, everyone was granted a yarn coupon to purchase four balls of string or yarn. They would trade some of their other ration coupons, such as their fish coupons, meat coupons, egg coupons, and even grain coupons for more yarn coupons. It was lucky that they were both slight and neither had a strong appetite. The cotton would be transformed into crochet tea towels, tablecloths, sofa covers, and gloves; they were always exchanging lace patterns with one another. She even crocheted a buttonless black top with wide sleeves and a Mandarin collar that could be worn over a shirt during the spring and autumn months, showing off the shirt’s patterns through the black lace, which was quite stylish for that era. The wild, restless days of her teenage years were in fact spent rather peacefully, even as chaos raged throughout society, leaving behind an entire house filled with crocheted clothes and decorations. One look at them was enough to reveal the chaos and luxury of that era. But since most of the articles were white, they always maintained a kind of purity. Later, she ended up being assigned to a local kindergarten where, coincidently, she ended up handling their bookkeeping, just like her mother. By this time, it was the mid-1970s and the Cultural Revolution was already in its final years, and fashion had finally returned to a sense of the everyday. By this time, she had grown into a bona-fide woman. Her clothes no longer felt old-fashioned; they were just right. Her fashion sense was considered conservative with a bit of flash; just as the seasons changed from late winter to early spring, for instance, she wore a pastel wool coat, a red and green scarf around her neck, navy wool pants, and a pair of short leather boots. She wore her hair in two long braids, which were held together with an acrylic hairpin. By then, her fashion sense was rather measured. She no longer had the anxious sensibility she had when she was younger; now her look was more cosmopolitan and quite contemporary.

It was during those years that she and her mother truly stood out on streets of the city. Her mother looked just like her, but they were set apart by their hairstyles. Her mother wore hers in a single braid looped around her forehead and secured with a hairpin. Then, by the late 1970s, when things started to really open up, her mother began wearing her hair as a bun, which she secured with a hairnet. She, on the other hand, opted to keep her hair in a ponytail. By this point, her age was finally beginning to catch up with her fashion, sometimes even surpassing it. However, both mother and daughter’s fashion seemed to stand the test of time. It was similar to playing the female qingyi role in traditional Chinese opera, where a good actor could play the same role from youth through to old age. In some ways, she seemed younger than before. And as the national mood continued to relax, mother and daughter added something new to their arsenal – makeup. Initally they applied each other’s makeup, but began to do their own once they’d got the hang of it. They would each sit before the old-fashioned vanity with three mirror panels, and apply their foundation, draw their eyebrows, and paint on eyeliner, making sure to add a slight upward curve at the edge of their eyes. They would purse their lips as they accentuated the corner of their mouths. The final touch would be powder to set their makeup. At this time, skirts came back into style. They both loved wearing skirts, especially long ones that went down to the ankle. In winter, they would wear wool skirts paired with ankle books to conceal the cuffs of the cotton pants they wore underneath. Only when velvet tights came into fashion did they begin to adjust their style. Skirts were much more versatile than pants; they could wear all different types of sweaters and jackets, which could make a look much more refined. They would finish it off with a long coat with an upturned collar. Once ready, they would descend, out the door, off to dance.

Usually they went to those neighborhood dance halls, or dance parties held in abandoned factories frequented by middle-age people. Admission prices were low and everyone conducted themselves like perfect ladies and gentlemen. They also attended social dances organized by their workplaces, which were also quite orderly and devoid of any strange people or drama. Neither of them ever brought a date; they just danced with each other. They were in perfect harmony, always complimenting one another’s moves regardless of the style of dance. Naturally, there were also times in which someone else would invite one of them to dance. Hidden in those adult dance halls, there were always a handful of middle-aged men who were true gentlemen from the old days. They would approach, bow ever so slightly, as if they were about to bend the knee, then take one of them by the hand and silently head onto the dance floor. Most of those dance floors were concrete, but the soles of their shoes tended to smooth them out over time. Both mother and daughter were light on their feet and let those gentlemen take the lead as they gracefully glided across the dance floor. When the song ended, it was back to the two of them dancing together. By the time the last song played it was usually not too late, maybe 10:30 p.m. or 11:00 p.m., and they would put on their jackets and head outside, to follow the twists and turns of the neighborhood streets and longtang alleys back home.

They lived in the garret-style pavilion of an old-style longtang apartment with two north-facing windows and a back window facing the patio; it was actually a double pavilion that was almost twice as large as the typical garret. They’d lived here ever since she was born. They shared a bathroom with the people on the second floor, and the kitchen was just outside the front door. Near the corner of the stairway was a gas stove, referred to as a ‘turtle head’, which they could use to boil water and cook. One would think their apartment would have been sparsely decorated, but it was actually filled with rosewood Western-style furniture, which was adorned with crocheted fabric covers of the time. The entire place had an elegant, feminine atmosphere. Mother and daughter gradually became obsessive about cleaning and managed to keep their twelve-or-thirteen-square-meter room free from even a single speck of dust. Who could have even imagined another world had existed within their small garret apartment – the paint peeling off the wall, the doors and windows rotten to the point that they are almost falling off their frames. In the summer they used cattail leaf fans whose edges were rolled with fine hemp rope and handles wrapped in thin strips of bamboo then bound with silk rope; the fans hung on the hook behind the closet door in the place usually reserved for men’s hats or ties. The hot water bag with the cover they had sewn from scraps of cloth was only used in winter – during the summer months it was stored in the bottom drawer of a large chest. Beside it was a tin container with buttons they had removed from old clothes, a bundle of sewing needles, and a tin chocolate box. The chocolate long eaten, the box now contained an assortment of random items – empty perfume bottles, which were now of no use but they couldn’t bear to throw them away, and three or four very rare New Year’s cards from a distant relative. He’d sent a few seemingly on a whim, but never bothered sending more. Every year when they did their big spring cleaning, they would think about whether or not to throw those cards away, but they would always push the decision back to the following year, just replacing the paper lining in the drawer and putting everything back where it had been. They used to line the drawers with old newspaper since they’d heard the smell of ink was a natural moth repellent. But when stiffer and smoother calendar paper became available, they replaced the paper lining at the bottom of every drawer with that instead, then also replaced the lining on the top of the cabinet. On top of the chest were a pair of abacuses, which mother and daughter both needed for their jobs, but they also served as their playthings. Back in the days before television, they would sit down with their abacuses after dinner and play various numbers games, seeing who could calculate various equations the fastest and with the greatest accuracy. Using three fingers on each hand, they would manipulate the upper and lower beads in a way that was both mesmerizing to watch and pleasing to the ear. Eventually, their abacuses were replaced with digital calculators and although they were no longer of any practical use, they continued playing their abacus games for a while before they gradually stopped. Instead, they began to watch television. Their old abacuses were relegated to the top of the chest. So there were changes in their lives, but they were soft, gentle changes rather than turbulent revolutions.

However, their apartment wasn’t as quiet as it seemed. They actually had quite a few regular visitors. Mother had one old friend – he was actually a distant relative – that she referred to as Brother Yun; her daughter called him Uncle Yun. He lived in the Pudong district of the city; back then people who lived in Pudong had a different accent. Whenever he came over he would bring snacks – sweet sorghum, steamed water chestnuts, homemake cakes, and, occasionally, he would bring something really special, like a full roasted hen – yellow beak, feet, and all. Mother refused to let him go home empty-handed, so she always filled his bag with treats of her own – cloud cakes, chicken crisps, and two jin of white cakes. Whenever he came over, they would sit down and reminisce about the past, such as that year when a fire broke out during someone’s funeral, or the time someone on Dongjiadu Road dressed up as a ghost to scam people out of their money – that guy scared the hell out of one woman. All of these stories sounded like typical gossip, but they somehow made the stories sound more serious. After hearing these kinds of rumors for so many years, their dark and tragic quality had faded; they were now simply another part of the everyday. During her days waiting to be assigned a job, Uncle Yun tried to set her up with a marriage prospect. The man was a technician who was five years older than her, a native of Pudong, and his family owned a house. By these measures, he should have been a good choice for her; after all, at the time she didn’t seem to have any other prospects. However, the simple fact that his family home was in Pudong put her off. She had grown up on the west side of the city, which was the more prosperous and cosmopolitan part of Shanghai – even if it meant living in a small north-facing room in an old alley neighborhood that froze in the winter, sweltered in the summer, and whose roof leaked during typhoon season, she still preferred it to Pudong. She was accustomed to her lifestyle; anywhere more than a few bus stops away was like an alien world. There were a few times during her middle school years where she’d been sent down to the countryside during autumn to participate in labor retreats in Fengxian, Songjiang, and Beixinjing. Before each trip, her mother prepared a backpack filled with underwear and safety pins; one of each for each day she was to be away. If the trip was for two weeks, there would be fourteen pairs of underwear and fourteen safety pins. Mother instructed her to change her underwear every day, wrapping the dirty pairs up and fastening them with a pin to take back home to wash – who knows how many thousands of different types of bacteria lived in the water in the countryside. The failed matchmaking attempt led to some tension between mother and Uncle Yun; she thought Uncle Yun was treating her daughter like some old maid that couldn’t find a husband. She didn’t realize just how many unemployed young women would have loved to have such an opportunity. It didn’t take long at all for that guy in Pudong to find a partner – the woman he ended up marrying was not only two years younger than her, but also came from a wealthy family. She didn’t want to be sent off to the countryside and marrying him allowed her to stay in Shanghai. When Uncle Yun came by to share the news with them, mother and daughter both smiled – neither seemed to have an ounce of regret.

Among their other frequent visitors were two or three of her old classmates from elementary school and middle school. They were all rather average girls with a similar disposition to her own and fairly indifferent to most things. But when they were together, they knew how to have fun. They would gossip about other girls, talk about what rumors they had heard spreading through the neighborhood, go to the local movie theater – they liked tragedies the best, that way they could all cry together. It would be growing dark by the time they emerged from the movie, some of the streetlights were just starting to turn on, and they would feel as if something inside them had been transformed. It would only be after they had walked a block or two from the theater that they gradually settled back into reality. After saying goodbye, she would stroll back down the alley where she lived and, as she arrived at the rear door, she would see the light on in the northern garret window, shining through the curtains embroidered with peach blossoms, projecting a series of flower shadows. The drama she had just watched on screen seemed to now be so very far away. When girls spent time together, they always ended up sharing some secrets with each other. During those days in which she was waiting to be assigned a job, she and her friends were all around eighteen or nineteen; how could they not think about marriage? But how could any of them dare to mention it? When they wanted to talk about it, they would instead share stories about other people. One such story was about a girl from some school who ended up getting knocked up by a married man. She bound her stomach tightly with a white cloth to conceal it, but one day while she was playing basketball at school, one of her classmates asked her why she was so fat. She erupted into a fit of anger, scolding her classmate for talking nonsense. There was another story about a pair of sisters from one of the local longtang neighborhoods; they were both in love with one of their cousins. The three of them spent all their time together, but their cousin couldn’t decide which one to be with – in the end, he married one of their classmates instead. These all felt like stories that could have come straight from a Jane Austen novel, with a touch of the vulgarity that comes with neighborhood gossip. There was something equally terrifying and thrilling about the way they privately gossiped about those taboo stories. Yet somehow those stories felt even more distant to her than the tragedies she saw playing out on screen at the movies. At the very least, the people and events displayed on the silver screen were in line with her aesthetic view of the world, whereas those other stories seemed completely unrelated to her. She was convinced that no such things could ever possibly happen to her – those were all extreme catastrophes, like a terrible disease, whereas her life was always a bastion of safety. Among this group of frequent visitors to their house there was one girl who was sent down to Anhui for re-education; another was assigned a job in a factory and no longer had time to spend with them; and then there was another girl – the one who first introduced them to the art of crochet lace – who continued to hang around for a while, but was also terribly anxious about getting assigned a job. They would often sit together, their heads practically touching, as they leaned over to crochet all kinds of designs. One would think they were extremely close with one another, but owing to their rather limited experience and simple lives, they were emotionally closed off. On a spiritual level, they were somewhat impoverished, and there wasn’t much for them to share with each other. That’s why they ended up spending all their time chatting about sewing and other trivial matters. By this time, there weren’t even any movies to see. It wasn’t long before that girl found herself a boyfriend and gradually stopped coming by their apartment.

Once she was assigned a job, she ended up getting along with one or two colleagues, but at her age it was already getting difficult to build a deeper relationship with new friends. She was very private, so her relationship with those new colleagues never evolved beyond the most pedestrian. That said, one of her colleagues did try setting her up with her brother-in-law and they actually went on a date! They met in a park one Sunday. They strolled the concrete paths, surrounded by the shrieks of playing children, and maintained enough distance that someone could have easily stood between them. It’s unclear if he ever even got a good look at her, she certainly didn’t get a good look at him – all she really took note of was his pair of triple-stich cap-toe black leather shoes and perfectly fitting tight nylon socks. What did they even talk about? He seemed to talk about his job as a technician at a metallurgical plant. Although she barely understood a thing he said, she didn’t necessarily find him boring. It wasn’t bad having someone near her, babbling on and on. At this point in her life she had begun to think it might be time for her to get married and settle down. However, after she got home and discussed everything with mother, she realized that if she married him her colleague would become her sister-in-law, which might make things at work complicated, so she turned him down. This kind of thing happened multiple times; there were always well-intentioned people who would cross the line by trying to set her up with various men. By then, she was past the ideal age for marriage; the ship of eligible bachelors had set sail. All of the men she was introduced to always had some kind of deficiency that made them unable to live up to her standards. Deep down she did want to get married, but she was in no rush, and in fact, it wasn’t something she spent very much thought on. Perhaps if she had been more focused on marriage, she would have been nervous, but after a few years, even that unconscious yearning faded.

Life was like a warm current of water flowing right past her. All of those whirlpools and undercurrents that might have otherwise swept her away simply slipped by without ever impacting her. Like when she was a little girl, she still shared a bed with her mother. It was a double bed, just four-and-a-half-feet wide. But neither of them took up much space. In fact, even after several decades the coir ropes supporting the mattress were still firm. There was only one or two occasions in which mother hired a neighborhood worker to replace a few of the coir ropes and tighten them up a bit. The bedspread used to be made from seersucker with red, blue, and yellow stripes but they later replaced it with a white poplin bedspread with an underlining embroidered with red strawberries. It was as if time stopped moving forward and was instead slipping back to the days of her childhood. Since they regularly waxed the furniture, the rosewood still glimmered with a healthy glow, as if new. Rosewood furniture also came back into fashion, especially that with Victorian-style carvings and patterns. It was as if contemporary style had suddenly stopped advancing. The ornamental covers on the furniture were a more recent trend and still in fashion. One new addition was a refrigerator with an ornamental handle decorated with pea-green and cranberry flowers; it added an extra layer of boudoir-style to their room. Over the past several years, they have replaced their television set several times. They started with a twelve-inch black-and-white set, then came a fourteen-inch color model, which they more recently swapped out for a twenty-five-inch flatscreen. They always kept the channel tuned to those Hong Kong and Taiwanese soap operas and every night, after they ate and did the dishes, mother and daughter would tune in to watch the latest episode of their favorite show. Together they would sigh, they would cry, but ultimately, they were watching those dramas with an air of indifference. Their lives were always so restrained, and because they consumed so very little, there was never anything to lose.

Every morning, mother had breakfast ready for her by the time she woke up; it was always something light, usually consisting of rice gruel, fermented tofu, or homemade bamboo shoots with beans. She washed her face and combed her hair in the sunlightless apartment. Their room was on the dark side of the garret and the vanity was situated against the wall between two north-facing windows. Without sunlight, whatever image was reflected in the mirror always appeared dark. But this was no issue, because the darkness masked her age; the reflection she saw in the mirror resembled a girl still in her twenties. Her skin was smooth, her hair a shiny black, and her eyes sparkled through the darkness. By the time she finished washing up, her rice gruel would already be growing cold. It was sitting on the table in a fine porcelain bowl with gold trim they had used for many years, bowls it would be impossible to find nowadays. The few out there are either cheap, unconvincing reproductions; poorly constructed from a coarse low-grade porcelain; or are those especially expensive and luxurious ones reserved for display during banquets. But none have that delicate homey quality of their porcelain set. After breakfast she would head off to work. They were fortunate that their traditional alley neighborhood somehow managed to avoid being targeted for demolition over the course of several urban reconstruction plans. The nearby roads were expanded and high-rise buildings went up all around their neighborhood, but somehow their traditional longtang remained untouched. That said, the people who lived in the neighborhood had changed quite a bit, especially those from her generation; most had married off or bought apartments elsewhere. There were some old-timers still hanging on in the neighborhood; they kept getting older, but since they were already old to begin with, they didn’t look much different from before. When they saw her strolling through the alleys they would affectionately greet her as ‘Meimei’ or ‘little sister’. There didn’t seem to be as many children in the neighborhood as before, when there used to be groups of them pouring out of every household. Nowadays they would only occasionally appear in groups of two or three, but only rarely. It was only in the mornings and evenings that the sounds of adults scolding their children, or kids arguing with their parents would ring out through the windows facing the courtyard. On rare occasions one could hear the sound of a baby crying. After a while, the cries would drift off and turn into babbling.

The bus she took to work changed its route several times. She used to be able to board it on the main road not far from the longtang, but later she needed to go to a stop on the small road behind her neighborhood, later that entire line was cancelled and she needed to take a different bus, which required multiple transfers. Eventually, she was able to take the subway. Strolling into the broad and brightly lit subway station waiting for the subway to rush towards her and stop at the platform, she could feel the progress of this era in which she lived; it was exciting. However, it wasn’t long at all before she gradually came to view all of that as perfectly natural; in fact, she could barely remember what the street even looked like before the subway station was built. All of those crowded little shops, apartments, primary schools, and noisy intersections were suddenly swallowed up by new thoroughfares as if they never even existed. All of those specialized items like peach crisps, salted candied dates, and roasted olives which used to be sold at southern goods market or the smoke shop were now all found together on the shelves of supermarkets. The pleasure involved in carefully selecting which item to buy along with the meticulous calculations involved were now swallowed by the process of bulk purchases. At first she felt as if she had lost her footing in this new world, but she quickly grew accustomed to things. There was actually something about taking entire bags of these products off the shelves that gave her a sense of affluence. While she didn’t have the kind of personality that actively pursued change, nor was she particularly tied to the past. She was someone who lived in the present moment; never thinking much about the past or the future, for the here and now was the only thing that was real.

The kindergarten where she worked had been relocated several times and even merged once or twice with other schools. Due to the One Child Policy, the number of children enrolled continued to decline until the point at which, approximately three years ago, her kindergarten had been converted into a retirement home. Throughout all of these changes, she continued to be the bookkeeper. Over the course of the past decade, the profession had become quite popular, and a great number of young women who’d already achieved advanced degrees began attending night schools for accounting. Most of those girls tried to work for those private or joint-venture companies, so as a bookkeeper working for a small neighborhood kindergarten, she wasn’t worried about facing competion. When it came to work, she was always meticulous, never made mistakes in her accounts, and kept her books extremely organized. Her entire professional life had been free of trouble or risk. If one were to insist upon her talking about the occupational hazards in her line of work, there were only one or two small examples that came to mind. One involved a bookkeeper who worked at a neighboring kindergarten, who was apparently a graduate of the famous Profit and Prosperity Accounting School. To please her boyfriend, she stole 170,000 RMB from the student meal fund – she was sentenced to death for her crime. This incident shook the entire early childhood educational system to its core. Even though she knew that she would never be capable of committing such a crime, she couldn’t help but feel anxious. Who knew? What if she were unconsciously making some mistake with one of the accounts? Thankfully she wasn’t the kind of person to get too anxious though, and that touch of anxiety quickly passed. The other hazard had to do with an article she read in the newspaper that claimed 10% of people diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases are accountants. The high ratio of infections was due to the fact that they frequently handled various banknotes, which, given their wide circulation, carry countless germs. This news terrified her, but the report also said that washing one’s hands could eliminate the risk of infection. From that point on, she was sure to wash her hands after touching any banknotes. She also made sure to wash her hands before and after going to the restroom and before and after eating. This allowed her to move through this minor crisis safely.

And just like that, her retirement was drawing near. Retirement also serves as a harsh warning, informing people that a certain amount of their time is up and life is about to entire a new phase. But this was no concern for her; after all, witnessing her mother’s life after retirement had already shown her what it was like. Her mother retired during her second year on the job – a change both mother and daughter greeted with relief. From that point forward they could bid farewell to their hectic lifestyle: the two of them no longer had to squeeze in front of the vanity each morning to get ready, they didn’t have to worry about not having enough time to wash their dirty dishes from breakfast before going to work, nor did they have to rush home from work to cook dinner. After retirement, mother would wake up an hour before her daughter so she had time to do her hair, cook breakfast, and buy groceries for lunch and dinner. After her daughter would leave for work, mother would tidy up the apartment and even had time to go for a stroll in the park and get some sun. After lunch she would take a nap to make up for that hour of sleep she lost waking up early. By the time her daughter got home, there was a hot meal already waiting for her on the table. In the park, mother met a few other retired women, one of which was a fan of Yue opera. One of the interesting things about that park was that it had a special corner devoted to Yue opera; every morning singers and musicians would gather to perform. There were also two women who would practice swordplay at the park; they very enthusiastically volunteered to give her lessons. Between listening to Yue opera and practicing swordplay, mother’s schedule at the park filled right up. Eventually, there was a widowed and retired teacher who developed a crush on her. He gave her a bouquet of roses on Mother’s Day. That day, as she entered the longtang neighborhood with those flowers in hand, the look on her face was a combination of embarrassment and joy – she looked like a teenage girl. That was also the reason she stopped going to the park. And before long a real estate developer took over more than half of the park; they demolished the original park wall and turned it into a green space in the middle of the street. She, on the other hand, found a new place to spend her time – the church. Following the urgings of one of her neighbors, mother turned to Christianity. She started attending church services every Sunday morning. At the same time, the Christian hymns helped her develop an affinity for singing. Naturally, mother had a much more open personality than her daughter; this wasn’t due to her richer life experience but simply because she had a more childlike disposition. Although daughter was naturally more closed off, thanks to her mother’s guidance, she too was able to start a new life. That is why the daughter was never worried about retirement.

Before long, it was her turn to retire. Just before her retirement, her work unit had arranged for her to participate in a trip to Zhangjiajie in the Hunan province, sponsored by the district trade union. This was a big deal for both mother and daughter. It may be hard to believe, but neither of them had ever set foot outside their city. Most think that peasants in the countryside are the only ones who never get out to see the world, but people in this city are equally cloistered, in fact, and it is even harder for them to leave because they lack the curiosity about the outside world that peasants have. They believe that living anywhere other than Shanghai is utterly unthinkable. However, times were changing and all kinds of new things began to emerge. One of those new things was traveling for leisure. Neither of them was very enthusiastic when it came to travel, but nor were they indifferent. If they had the opportunity to go see some new places and have a good time, why not take advantage of it? It’s not like they were setting out to earn a living. The television, magazines, and advertisements from various travel agencies all brought those faraway places much closer to them – they no longer felt so distant and terrifying. All of this began to invisibly transform these conservative urbanites’ view of the world.

Mother and daughter excitedly began preparations several days before her trip. Their first consideration was hygiene. Mother bought a bottle of alcohol cotton balls, disposable wet wipes, paper towels, and toilet paper, which she carefully packed into plastic bags. In order to prevent cross-contamination, she also prepared a bottle of Dettol antiseptic liquid. The second thing they prepared was food, which mainly consisted of crackers and instant noodles, which she could eat in case she didn’t like the local food. She was actually quite picky, and there were all kinds of things she didn’t eat: lamb, beef, chili, garlic, coriander, radish, pepper, and egg yolk. In case she did eat something that upset her stomach, they packed plenty of Berberine. In terms of clothing, they focused on packing outfits that would keep her warm. Although it was early autumn, they insisted on packing cotton pants, a wool sweater, and a raincoat. Figuring that she would likely do a lot of walking and mountain hiking, they bought her a pair of hiking shoes. Those shoes were a departure from their usual fashion, bringing an athletic energy and a sudden burst of modern sensibility to her elegant style. Finally, they couldn’t help but think about the colleagues she would be travelling with. Mother and daughter were both affable and valued their relationships with others highly. Now that she would be traveling with her colleagues, it would be especially important for her to look out for one another and maintain a close relationship with her fellow travelers. That led them to take a trip to the supermarket to buy a bunch of snacks she could share with everyone: prunes, Taiwanese plums, hawthorn slices, Want Want senbei crackers, and chocolate covered nuts. They divided the snacks up into small packets, which they stuffed into all the remaining nooks in her already packed suitcase – somehow they managed to squeeze it all in. With all these snacks and the rest, her luggage ended up extremely heavy. The day she boarded the train, they even recruited Uncle Yun to help carry her suitcases. By this time, Uncle Yun was already an old man with a large bald spot, but he was still strong enough to help with her luggage, carrying each large suitcase under each arm. Mother and daughter shuffled behind him, carrying just a bunch of small odds and ends. Once aboard the train, each of her suitcases took up an entire row on the luggage rack. The colleagues traveling with them were actually from different work units, so they didn’t know each other, but since they were traveling together and everyone was excited for the trip, they all helped each other out. No one uttered a word that could spoil the mood. This put mother at ease and she motioned for her daughter to pass around some of the snacks they had prepared. That meant that they had to take down the large suitcase they had just put up on the rack, open it up, and search for those packages of snacks tucked away inside. By then, the train was about to depart and the conductor was already instructing those without tickets to leave the train. They were still passing the snacks around when the train began to gradually pull away from the station, interrupting the emotional moment when mother and daughter were about to say goodbye. But in a way, the hasty departure helped them avoid making it into an awkward public scene.

The sanitary conditions on the train were actually much better than what she had imagined. She was lucky in that the passenger car seemed new, with a fresh carpet, new bedding and curtains. Even the conductor’s uniform seemed to be a new design. Sitting together in that bright, clean carriage, she quickly got to know everyone sitting with her. Going out of town allowed her to leave all those random daily tasks aside; she felt particularly relaxed and her speech grew excitable, punctuated by frequent bursts of laughter. There were about a dozen people in her tour group, six of whom were women, and they all slept together in the same sleeper compartment on the train. Once they arrived, some of the hotel rooms had three beds while others had two, so the women divided themselves up into groups based on the size of the rooms. She partnered up with Xiao Hong, who worked for the trade union and helped organized the trip. Xiao Hong was in her late twenties and had a child that had just learned to walk. She seemed to have left a favorable impression on Xiao Hong, who suggested they share a room. Their room had three beds, so they added a girl named Xiuping, who was a model worker in their district and director of some neighborhood committee. Although she was only forty, she looked much older than her. Among their group, there were two others she became close with; she spent a lot of time with them all on the trip and just being with them made her feel more at ease. For their first meal together on the train, everyone sat together with the food they’d brought. With sausage, eggs stewed in tea, roasted chicken, cake, hamburgers, instant noodles, and all kinds of fruits, nuts, and drinks, it was quite the sumptuous feast. For their second meal, they divided up into small groups – the men either went to the meal car or stayed behind to wait for the vendor that sold box lunches. The women on the other hand just finished up their leftovers from the previous meal. Xiao Hong didn’t eat anything, instead choosing to crawl into her bunk and take a nap – everyone said she must be missing her son. Once the lights came on and the world outside the window grew dark, the train carriage seemed warmer. Only on the rarest of occasions had she ever spent the night away from home; she felt like she had been transported to different world. Sitting on the bunk and gazing out at the broad expanse of darkness outside the window, she would occasionally catch sight of a flurry of lights shooting past. As they approached their first stop, the lights flashed by more frequently, there was something almost resplendent about them. When the train pulled into the station, crowds of people on the platform rushed towards the door urgently. A vendor on the platform pushed a cart alongside the train windows to sell snacks to the passengers already aboard; in contrast to the chaos of the people trying to board, the vendor appeared completely at ease. Even though she looked about the same age as Xiao Hong, she was actually the only one among the group nearing retirement age, so they let her have the bottom bunk. She didn’t sleep very well that night. Every time they pulled into another station she would wake up and turn to look out the window. Although it was the middle of the night, the station lights were all brightly lit and the platform was filled with people busting around and getting on and off the train. Oh, what a lively night it was! As she slipped in and out of sleep, she gradually got further and further away from Shanghai, beginning her life of travel.

She turned out to be more adaptable than she had imagined. The weather in Hunan was extremely humid – she would hand wash her clothes but after two days they still weren’t dry and then she’d have to move on to the next hotel. She constantly felt hot and sticky. There were a few times she thought she was on the verge of getting sick, but somehow managed to avoid it. In the end, it was Xiao Hong that had the hardest time adapting; she broke out in a rash and developed an upset stomach – she was the one who ended up having to take care of Xiao Hong. Most of the food in Hunan used a lot of hot peppers. When they ate hot pot there were a few bright red peppers floating in the broth; she didn’t realize how spicy they were until it was too late. Later she learned to fish those red peppers out of the broth as soon as they brought the pot to the table; but it was always hard to get them all out. Over the course of the subsequent days, she surprisingly discovered that she could actually handle spicy food and found it especially good with rice. On one occasion she ate a piece of meat that she couldn’t identify; only after trying it did the restaurant owner tell her it was turtle meat. Although it was a bit strange for her to eat something like that, there wasn’t much she could do since she had already eaten it. The next time turtle meat was on the menu she just went ahead and ate it; she had, after all, already crossed that bridge. She also found that she was quite the walker, being light and nimble meant that she could hike for long distances without getting tired. But she never did wear those hiking shoes she brought; they just didn’t look right on her. Instead, she just wore her usual pair of light brown leather shoes with short heels, which felt perfectly comfortable. They even took a bamboo raft out on the Mengdong River. Several of the women held hands and gripped one another tightly as their raft tossed up and down against the waves. They exhausted themselves with laughter. The scenery was so gorgeous it looked like a painting and she felt like she was now a part of that painting.

Her favorite thing was the tourist products sold at each scenic location they visited. Those items were actually all quite similar, yet she nevertheless loved going from one vendor to the next, carefully looking at all the products and haggling over prices. The trinkets sold were all low-quality and poorly designed, yet she found them to be a source of endless fascination. She had actually seen so very little of the world that her perspective on things was likely no different from that of a girl who’d grown up on a farm. It wasn’t long before the trinkets she bought took up all the space in her luggage that had once been occupied by those snacks and instant noodles. Whenever the vendors were women, they would ask her all kinds of questions, like where was she from, what kind of work she did, how many children she had, and how old she was. At first she would answer truthfully, telling them that she wasn’t married but gradually came to think twice about that, instead simply saying: They’re in Shanghai! For the vendors that were particularly chatty and insisted on knowing how many kids she had, their ages, and whether they were boys or girls, she would just smile and walk away. Later she took a feistier approach, spewing lies and teasing them. Sometimes she’d tell them she had a little boy, other times she would say she had a little girl; sometimes she said she only had one child, other times she would say she had two; as for their ages, sometimes she would say they were in kindergarten, other times she would say they were in college. Hearing that, some of the vendors would get suspicious and ask just how old she was. She would tell them the truth but none of them believed her. If they asked again, she would simply repeat her answer. Gradually she came to take pleasure in these exchanges, sometimes even kicking off the conversation. For instance, when she saw a child she would ask the mother: How old is he? Where do you plan on sending him to school? Then the mother would naturally start asking her similar questions. There was only one occasion in which a woman she was chatting with pointed to the male members of her group and asked: Which one of them is your husband? The question left her so embarrassed she simply scurried away.

From the Mengdong River, the group arrived at a place called Wang Village. It was a remote village that became famous after it was used as the shooting location for a film. The village capitalized on the film by naming all of its restaurants and sites after people, places, scenes, and plotlines from the film. They also performed all kinds of local songs, dances, dragon boat races, rain ceremonies, and other traditional rituals. Wang Village was located alongside the Mengdong River and in the distance were a series of dark green mountains surrounded by pristine blue water and a forest of jade green trees. The town that developed alongside this waterway must have been a prosperous hub. The local houses in the town are adorned with blue-gray bricks, black tile roofs, and high retaining walls. There is something truly enchanting, almost seductive, about the area which was once the cradle of Chu civilization. There was a woman standing in a doorway holding a little girl that couldn’t have been more than a year old. The little girl was wearing a small hat that resembled the mythical qilin; she had bright red lips, dark black eyes, and suddenly cast them a strange glance. It was the kind of look that clearly only an adult woman would be capable of making – the corners of her eyes shot up, her cheeks displayed what appeared to be a smile, and a mysterious look crossed her face – the whole thing was extremely strange. She couldn’t help but be shocked by the girl’s expression.

Playing out on stage of a pop-up theater in front of the bluestone street was a traditional tale about love and marriage. The performers didn’t look like professional singers or dancers. Their movements were uncoordinated and their singing and acting seemed to lack any formal training. Their expressions also appeared somewhat restrained; they couldn’t compare to the vitality expressed by the local mountain people walking in the streets; yet there was something quite beautiful about their appearances and the way they sang. The girls on stage all had a pure beauty and a unique twinkle in their eyes. Hidden beneath the surface of their awkwardness was the romantic yearning of a budding love – they must have all been little demons when they were young, like the girl she’d seen in the doorway. Of the two lovers the story was about, the boy was more petite than the girl and extremely thin. He was less striking than the girl, but he had an intense look in his eyes. When he locked eyes with the girl it was as if he were silently conveying thousands of thoughts to her. Although she couldn’t understand the lyrics they were singing, their voices had a purity about them, and though the drums and melody were a bit out of tune, their rhythm and overall spirit were perfectly in sync. Once they’d finished their song, the boy and girl exchanged bouquets of hydrangeas and held hands. Next on stage was a clownish grandmother character played by a young man – she was the matchmaker. Together they drank and sang in a scene that was clearly a wedding banquet. As their singing continued, it grew in intensity. Finally, out of nowhere, a palanquin appeared, carried down from the stage and into the crowd of tourists. A woman announced in Mandarin Chinese: ‘Someone is trying to kidnap the bride!’

Once the sedan chair arrives at the crowded street, the performance reached its climax. The onlookers grew chaotic as they made way for the sedan chair to pass. Leading the procession were four girls dressed in pink. The sedan was covered with a banner of shining red silk and carried by four young men dressed in green who danced through the crowds. Next came the sound of horns and flutes, announcing the festive atmosphere. Auspicious clouds suddenly appeared in the sky above, hovering above the peaks of the green mountains. Several boats came to the shore, bringing with them even more tourists. A smile appeared on the actresses’ faces, but they were much more natural than when they were on stage. This was clearly their favorite part of the performance, it had a mischievous spirit about it. The actresses scanned the crowd, searching for someone in the audience who could play the role of the bride. They looked up and down through the bustling crowd as they walked half the length of the street. All the girls in the crowd laughed and screamed as they moved out of their way. They were all terrified of being pulled into the sedan chair, but in fact, they all secretly hoped to be chosen. The performers smiled but didn’t stop, until they reached her. The four girls suddenly exchanged glances and came to a halt; this signalled to the four boys behind them to lower the sedan chair and wait. That is when four pairs of hands suddenly reached out to grab, snatching her up before she even had the chance to scream. Seemingly out of thin air, they conjured up a red wedding robe, which they slipped over her before pushing her into the sedan chair, raising it off the ground, and shuttling her away. This time, the young men carrying the sedan chair break into a light jog as they crossed the street. The horns blaring behind them became more furious. Everyone in the street was clapping and cheering, especially her colleagues, whose palms grew red from clapping. Deep down, they are all rather surprised – after all, she isn’t the youngest or prettiest, how did those actors so quickly figure out that she is a single and unmarried woman?

Those young men and women surrounded the sedan chair as they trotted in a circle around the bluestone streets. Only when they finally returned to the spot where they picked her up did they stop to let her out of the palanquin. Wearing that crimson silk robe, she was smiling, her face bright red. Xiao Hong and Xiuping helped her down from the chair and out of that wedding robe, tossing it back to the palanquin bearers. She laughed so hard that her body grew limp and she couldn’t speak, but her heart was racing. The sound of the drums and horns gradually faded into the distance before eventually falling silent. The crowd began to disperse and the mood of jubilation died down. But she was still laughing, as were her colleagues, who surrounded her. In that moment, she was like a celebrity, and not knowing how to act, all she could do was laugh. The sound of her laughter echoed along the bluestone streets. Had this village been devoid of all these tourists and performances, it would have been an extremely peaceful place. They could hear the sound of their footsteps, which rang out against the bluestone streets. After laughing for so long, she began to feel tired. Her laughter suddenly ceased and she felt tears in her eyes."

    "text": "They started out as fraternities, the cults. Poorer students wanted strong networks, like the ones boarding school pupils had already. At the start, in the 50s and 60s, they were just normal societies. Like many things, they took a brazy turn in the 70s. Splits in the main fraternities led to infighting, then military rulers saw a chance to use them to break up student protests, pumped them with money and cutlasses and guns and set them at the unions. Fraternities began to intimidate professors for grades, prostitute female students, carry machetes and practice idol worship of unseen Gods.

We could ask why the religious, metaphysical element is there but it’s there in a lot of places – it’s there in Parliament, it’s there in the White House. The more pressing question is: why do positive things turn negative in one context, but not in another? In Nigeria it’s like everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. We can’t catch a break and from what I’ve seen online it causes Nigerians a lot of anxiety because they worry there’s something uniquely wrong with them – I mean us – as a people, to have a government like this, a police force like this, a power grid like this and so on. Looking at it from the UK and knowing the people here this explanation seems ridiculous, but it’s hard to argue with the weight of history. I mean, say what you want about phi-bettta-gamma or whatever, but there’s no massacres section on their Wikipedia. I spend a lot of time digesting this stuff. I wrote a whole article and still I didn’t feel like I’d got it all out.

I told my dad about the piece on the motorway, one hour after my tenancy ended. My landlord had put the rent up, and now my boxes blocked the rearview mirror. Other cars glid past like snooker balls.

Article ke? Dad said, looking in the back mirror.

The one for VICE. That’s the first one I’ve got in there.

Are they big?

Yeah they’re big Dad, I said, smiling.

His face softened.

And they paid you for this?

Yes.

VICE, he muttered to himself. That means sin doesn’t it? Is that a good thing to call a magazine?

My mum flashed a smile: what’s the article about?

Cults in Nigeria.

My dad groaned.

Don’t you think people want to read something positive?

I write a lot of positive things.

Eh, about Europe, and America. It’s only Nigeria’s dirty laundry that you want to put out in the open. That’s where they write about Nigeria isn’t it? On Sin dot com.

I went out to see a few of my friends from school, the ones who were still in the area. I caught myself looking at them and thinking: Shit, you’re old. I couldn’t shake the feeling we were only kids in adult make-up with fake beards, clothes too big for us, bodies too big for our heads. I saw my friend Ama. At school she’d been one of those people you never saw on their own.

We were at a pub in Purley, a little Brexit but the drinks were cheap – wooden walls and stained red and gold carpets, and a contingent of sixty-year-olds who never seemed to leave. It was the same pub Ama’s dad had caught her at back when we were younger. We must’ve been sixteen or something and he dragged her out by her hair and it was a big deal on Snapchat, one of those vids that got screen recorded so many times the captions stacked on top of each other until you could barely see what was going on. I brought the story up again to liven up the conversation and she did one of those fake smiles you do to crazy people. Ama is someone whose face is the mirror of her emotions, she can’t help it. She must have grown up in a very different family to me to get away with being so open. Or maybe a similar family, but one she dealt with differently. I dropped it regardless – I didn’t want her to be mad at me and if we started talking embarrassing stories from them times I’d be in trouble anyway. I ordered her another drink. We ran into a few people from school who wanted to know what I was doing, but it was never what they expected it to be.

I got back and my parents were watching MasterChef in the dark. Somebody’s main course had fallen apart. The lamb was overcooked, the fondant potatoes – something that had never looked appetising to me at all and that I take as proof that people will eat anything if you say it in French – were hard, the jus hadn’t reduced. The contestant brought the food to the judges with shame deep in her eyes.

I don’t think I’ve shown you what I’m really capable of, she said.

No, you haven’t, my dad said, you’re going home!

He chuckled.

My mum was shouting to my dad – not at him – in a mix of Yoruba and English. She took the last can out of her shopping bag and slammed it down on the counter then drew her finger across the top of the tin as though marking a pie chart, dividing it in half and then half again. My dad was ambivalent. His body too, was split down the middle – one hand in his pocket signalling calm, the other with one single finger pointing, signalling husbandly outrage on his wife’s behalf. Something to do with hitting something else. Oko, the word for car. Something that happened a long time ago, something to do with never forgetting. I heard the word for car again and cut in asking if the Volkswagen was ok.

I said oko, she said, not ọkọ̀.

Someone hit your farm?

Your dad’s father had a farm back in your dad’s town.

There are some legal issues, my dad said.

People with issues in their head, she said.

Oh, I said.

In your father’s family.

I glanced at my dad. That sounds tough, I said.

They have a more forthright approach to dealing with issues, he said.

Forthright. I tried to understand: How do you mean?

They’re not as Western, he said. They value different things.

Mum laughed, almost a snort. She mimed washing her hands and shook them in front of her.

God help me, she said. My husband works for the United Nations.

My mum picked the blue reusable shopping bag off the countertop, folded it loudly and stuffed it into the drawer under the sink. I looked at my dad, who now had both hands in his pockets. He said something in Yoruba, more calmly. My mum replied and they nodded conspiratorially. The discussion had closed. My dad pointed at me with his lips, then the hallway, then me, then the hallway again.

Before you write another article, he said. On WICKEDNESS.

Mum bumped into me getting out the shower at three in the afternoon as she was coming back from her prayer group and raised her eyebrows. I waved at her. I went downstairs to eat and found my dad waiting for me in the kitchen. I sat down with my cereal and he stood over me with his hands clasped behind his back. He cleared his throat.

We’re going to work on a little project today, he said, in the garden.

Any discussion of my dad must include the garden. It’s a monument to the strength of an African man’s will; unbending, unyielding water crashing endlessly on life’s shores, and less a location itself than a collection of textures and intersecting planes, grass slopes, shallow brick walls, pink and green and lavender and yellow, with green and purple hedges on either side. Recently something had been eating at the rose bushes. My dad didn’t know what, and he was determined to compensate for the damage in other areas until the threat could be apprehended.

We went to work repotting the hydrangea bushes. I squatted down to hold their ceramic pots steady, while my dad hacked at the soil to get them free and then held the whole bush aloft with one arm, like a heretic’s head, leaving me to scramble for a new pot. He lowered the bush back into position and we alternated between pouring new soil and patting down what was there already into place. Two hours, thirty pots. Rinse and repeat.

That was Saturday.

On Sunday the project was raking the leaves. I went round after him kicking the leaves into tighter piles, then circling round to bag them up. I had a thought.

Do you have any gloves? I asked.

Gloves? He said.

For the leaves.

What, are they going to cut you?

You don’t have garden gloves?

Dad put one hand on my shoulder.

It’s good to feel the plants, he said.

I had one earbud in and I listened to a podcast on the Iraq War as analysed through Simpsons episodes. They went over this Treehouse of Horror episode where Kang and Kodos invade Springfield and blame it on their weapons of mass disintegration. You see Tony Blair and these suits now on daytime TV and life insurance ads but twenty years ago he was lying so Britain could burn people alive. Listening to all this stuff made me feel that people have very short memories when it comes to the things they’re ashamed of.

I picked a thorn out my thumb and sucked the blood out the wound. Rusty, slightly sweet. Just then Dad’s rake hit on a snag at the very back of the garden, close to the fence. He called me over to look, scraped the top layer of leaves off and saw something that made him put the rake down. The flesh was grey and wet but the ribcage was clearly visible, about the size of a small dog. I couldn’t make out where the head was supposed to be.

Oh my God, I said.

Dad squatted over the body. He took his hood down, exposing his bald head to the rain. So you were the bastard that attacked my rose bushes, he said. I told God to punish you, and my God is a mighty God because you have been struck down. You didn’t know it was my roses you were eating. But you know now.

A few days after that I met back up with Rika. We had met on the apps, although we had crossed paths a few years before at a young journalist conference in Hamburg. She was much more attractive, in person, than I remembered her being. She had big eyes and short black hair, a kind of sickly, striking, look to her cheeks. She talked to me about the things her ex-boyfriend had done to her and the state of the publishing industry, and then she asked me what I wrote about for my last article.

It was about cults in Nigeria, I said.

I got voted most likely to join a cult in high school you know, she said.
I continued talking. The cults I was writing about weren’t religious, or at least they didn’t start that way. By the late 80s, early 90s, they were out of control, I said. Animal sacrifices at crossroads, mass shootings, all that stuff. I found this anti-cult poster from the 90s.

Rika took my phone. The screen read:

SECRET CULT IS DEATH. THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF NIGERIA WARNS THAT SECRET CULT IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR SOUL.

She pursed her lips.

Dangerous to your soul, she said. I like that. I wish the British government warned about dangers like that.

When it was time to part, I went for a hug but she offered a handshake instead. Fair enough, I thought. Leaving, I came through central Brixton and the crush of people outside the station towards Electric Avenue, selling incense, stepping around homeless people with cardboard signs and caps turned up in front of them. Many old people too but getting older myself I understood that old and young were different points in the same stream. I considered what my dad would’ve looked like passing through this same street ten or twenty years ago, how he would’ve dressed, how he would’ve walked, even. Rika texted while I was on the bus. She wanted me to go for dinner with her and her parents next week. The bus turned suddenly and I nearly fell over.

I got back late, maybe one in the morning. There was a red BMW parked in the driveway and lights on in the living room. Coming through the doorway I peered in: there my parents were, on the couch with a man who looked familiar but who I couldn’t quite place, moist skinned and with a belly like a sawed-off basketball stuffed under his jumper. He was talking about a restaurant to my dad, about a customer trying to leave without paying. The man on the couch described sneaking through the kitchen to confront the customer with a card reader and a wooden spoon. He saw me in the hallway and waved me into the living room.

Look at him, the man said, he doesn’t remember me.

Of course he remembers you, my dad said.

Where do you remember me from?

I said he’d been at my confirmation party. That was always a good guess. The man nodded patiently, then roared with laughter. Closer now I noticed that my mum had bags under her eyes, and as the man began a story about himself and a group of Chinese seafood suppliers going drinking at a pub in Hastings, she got up abruptly, saying she should go sleep.

No, stay here, stay with us! The man said. He shifted in his seat but his belly seemed always to stay in the same place.

I’m so tired.

We can sleep when we’re dead!

Nobody will die in Jesus’ name, she said. Bami, this is your Uncle Bolaji. Make sure you switch the light off when you come upstairs. Last night you forgot.

Uncle said he should be going as well. He gathered himself to his feet heavily and mentioned something about inviting the family to his restaurant. Chioma will be so happy to see you, he said.

When you come back in the day, Dad said, I’ll show you the garden properly.

Talk louder man, Uncle said, you’re slurring.

I’ll show you the garden.

Which garden?

My dad puffed his cheeks out and Bolaji slapped him on the back.

You know this man was the only man at university with a garden, he said. He fenced off a section of bush behind the Pharmacology labs, like it was Hyde Park.

 

–

 

My dad rolled fluffy balls of pounded yam greedily between his fingers and dipped them into rich red and green stew. He dabbed the fingertips of his right hand in the bowl of water and reached for his glass of Guinness, burping and covering his mouth with a napkin. Bolaji watched him happily as he ate, and then craned his head around and watched a server clear a table. Eagle-eyed, he slipped easily between total agitation and relaxation, not unlike a father watching his child on the swing sets.

They played the specifics of their shared history out for my benefit, my mum chipping in to clarify or affirm – best friends at university but separated by migration, re-united by migration as well when Uncle came to the UK looking for a job in a kitchen and slept on my dad’s couch until he found one. They were separated again when Bolaji went to Lagos to set up a restaurant there. Uncle tired of this line of conversation quickly, I sensed it made him feel old. He asked what I was doing with my time.

Gardening with my dad, I said, and trying to place pitches, after my last article.

What’s your last article about?

Cults in Nigeria. His eyes lit up; he collected himself. He took on a haughty look and folded his arms.

Cultism, he said, what do you know about cultism?

I know what I researched, I said.

That’s not knowledge. In the bush they say there are two kinds of knowledge – the kind that you know from what you have seen with your own eyes and your own ears, and everything else. Research is not real knowledge.

So I should join a cult?

No. But you should interview someone who did.

Uncle wrote a number on a napkin and handed it over. Next to the number he’d written his own name.

But the original cultist is right over there, he said, pointing. International Soul Cultist Extraordinaire.

Taking his napkin and turning it over in his hands my dad tore at the paper and placed the scraps in a pile on his plate. He nodded, only slightly, eyes lowered.

It wasn’t one of those terrible ones that they have these days, Uncle continued. It was a lot of fun when we were doing it. That’s not to say nobody got hurt. There was a bit of wahala. But these kids these days, they’re crazy. They’re shooting their professors.

I nodded. The things I was researching happened in my parents’ country, in their lifetimes. Why shouldn’t they be a part of them? Why not a cult, I thought to myself. People do all kinds of things when they’re young.

What was it called? I said.

We were the Norse. Everybody was a Pirate back in those days, but your dad – he pointed again, enthusiastically – he was a bit of a maverick.

He came up with the name?

Oh, he came up with everything. The name, the pledge, the colour scheme, the logo.

Wow.

Yes o. He was actually the leader, you know. The chief.

Bolaji that’s OK, Mum said.

He reached into his jacket pocket. Where’s the dis-ting. I have a picture somewhere. We used to call him Magnus.

Because of the Norse?

See? Uncle clicked his fingers, you got it. This kid has sense oh. You dey raise am well.

Magnus, I thought, a whole new name. An old name actually. I’d been calling him Dad, but he’d had a whole lifetime’s worth of people calling him Magnus, the Scandinavian name, in the cult that he founded and designed the logo for. By now he’d taken his own napkin apart totally and started on my mum’s. The pieces were all the same size, they were all the same square shape. He glanced back at me, a few times. I didn’t know how to read it. I thought for a second he was going to jump out his chair and drag me out the restaurant like a naughty child. It was only later I realised he was worried I was judging him. I had never seen embarrassment on his face before.

Rika was late and I was on time. Her parents trailed behind her, looking like college professors, which is what they were. They had their arms around each other and their coats were nearly identical shades of brown, something akin to old corrugated iron.

She and her parents talked mainly to each other, not cutting me out of the conversation but not leaving space for me either. Her father had the flu, it was going around. Rika’s mother had had a hip replacement a few months before. By the time dessert came they were in an argument about whose side of the family was weirder, the mum’s or the poorer father’s. I sat back and observed, I sat back and thought. There’s self-obsessed, but what’s the word for when a group of people are obsessed with each other? Maybe they don’t have one, I thought, or at least one that isn’t to do with nationalism and ethnic cleansing.

I checked for the best route home and saw there was a train strike on and the bus would take an hour and a half. There was no way my parents would still be awake. I didn’t want to stand in the street for too long so I started walking to the bus stop, down a quiet suburban street. How many families on this road alone, I thought, a driveway and a front garden and one point five children, fifteen years of selective silence, places in the parents’ minds the kids can’t go. A waiting room, one person standing and another sedated lying down, some callipers, some screaming, a twelve to sixteen hour wait then a baby’s born, then a mother, then a father, all one after the other in that order. There was a gust of wind; I pulled my coat collar up. A red Mercedes pulled up alongside me and the window rolled down. The driver shouted blackie! out the window and sped off. I put my headphones in and checked my phone again for buses. A few minutes later I saw headlights in front of me and turned to see a red car driving up again and I quickened my pace, but the car was a BMW not a Mercedes. The window rolled down. Uncle Bolaji looked at me, appalled.

Walking at this hour? You don’t have a car?

He pulled over and waited for me to get in. The car smelled of mothballs and cologne.

Seeing a lady friend? He said.

I considered if I had been.

You know what, he said, I don’t want to know.

He typed a postcode into the sat-nav; it was my post code. The sat-nav was an overlarge screen surrounded by silver metal rails which curved like the lane we were turning off now and onto a two-lane road towards a roundabout.

What’s her name? he said.

Rika.

Just Rika?

I don’t know her surname yet, you know.

Ah. That’s not good. You don’t know her surname, and you’re sleeping with her?

I’m not sleeping with her.

Of course not, he said. Don’t tell me.

We came closer to the roundabout. Bolaji had brought a smell with him into the car, it came over the air-con, slightly bitter, malty. One hand came off the steering wheel and gripped my shoulder. I felt we were going to clip the parked cars to our left.

You shouldn’t let the dark meet you outside, especially not with women, he said. It doesn’t end well. No, listen. I know what you’re thinking. I’m being a hypocrite. But it’s because I’m a hypocrite that I’m saying something worth listening to.

What were you up to?

Me myself I wasn’t out tonight actually, he said. I was at home having a few beers and I wanted to go for a drive.

Oh ok.

I looked out the window.

A few beers?

Maybe three or four.

How’s Chioma? I said. You said she was feeling ill before?

She’s better now. You know when you have a wife and they get ill you can’t be out gallivanting the way you are now. I remember your dad at uni, he missed a whole week because your mother had a cold.

I reached and turned the radio down.

I thought my parents met in London, I said.

Yes, he said. Yes, London.

But you’re saying they knew each other in Nigeria.

Yes. Yes, Nigeria too. But not very well, he said.

They were going out with each other, in Nigeria.

Yes.

But they didn’t know each other well?

No, they knew each other. But not as well as they were going to. That was the first time, he said, they met in Nigeria the first time.

Why did they stop talking, I said, my parents. What happened?

You should ask them, he said. They’ll tell you.

I looked over at him.

Alright, he said, alright. So they started at university. But your grandad, he had a farm. Farming makes people strict. And he was Christian as well, not like the Christians they have here, these ones that they don’t go to church. Christian with a capital C. When he found out your dad was seeing someone, he locked him in the basement for a week. Word got out. When the Norse found out we went down and beat hell out of that your grandad. We thought Magnus would be thankful, but he was mortified. The whole campus was talking about him. He stopped speaking to your mother.

There was that name again, Magnus. And a basement for a week. I thought of a little window up near the ceiling, some metal bars. A crowd of people with mutton chops and those cardboard cut-out afros they had in the eighties, stomping on my grandad’s head.

You happy now? He said.

I don’t know, I said. I’m still thinking about it.

It’s not that much to think about.

A cult beating up my grandad?

He laughed, a roar. You don’t know Nigeria, he said. You don’t even know England. That kind of thing happens every day.

I shrugged.

I think it’s good I told you. It’s good for bonding. So what if your mother disowns me. You should come over for dinner sometime. Chioma would be happy to see you again, she loves kids.

I’m not a kid.

Sure you’re not, Uncle said. You know we had a boy like you, but he didn’t make it out the hospital.

He flicked the indicator and craned his head around a bend in the road.

I told you the one about knowledge, he said, I’ll tell you another one. In Nigeria, they say it’s better to never have children than to have one child and lose it. That’s the worst. We say if a man with one child loses it, he’s lost his life.

I folded my hands in my lap.

I didn’t know about that.

How would you, you just met me a month ago.

He clapped me on the shoulder again.

Sorry about this jinky-janka driving oh, normally when I’m drunk I just – he made a gliding motion with his hand. I must be getting old.

The streetlights bathed him in waves of amber light through the window. I saw his whole face relax like somebody sleeping, just for a moment, then it snapped back like a rubber band.

A week later the foxes came again. My dad noticed when he was having his morning black breakfast tea; he dropped his mug and it shattered. I found him in the kitchen with my mother’s hands on his shoulders. Bolaji was visiting Nigeria for work, and Dad’s centre of gravity had shifted back to her.

I think the garden centre is middle class heaven, but in a pagan sense. The Greeks thought you’d wander forever in foggy fields, not knowing your own name, and this has come to pass in our world: all around me, pensioners changed direction in the middle of the aisle, looked left and right and left again, down at their paper maps and out in front of them in vast open spacing, calling out to one another with hoarse voices.

We’d gone to replace them but we couldn’t find the same kind of roses. Light pooled thick and hot under the greenhouse ceilings and I felt like an ant under a magnifying glass. I considered my dad, small and exhausted, walking through long aisles under the glass and dirty white plastic. His arms were tucked tight to his sides and his face was worn out, and I found myself feeling protective. All he wanted was his family and his garden. Why had I never seen him this way before?

What do you think? He asked.

I don’t know.

He made a face.

Maybe the dog roses.

That could work.

Bush in trolley he went to find a garden centre worker. He looked around and mumbled something.

Excuse me? The woman said. I’m sorry, I can’t hear you.

Do you have anything to deal with foxes? He said.

Deal with them?

She showed us to a section with electric boxes that emitted an ultrasonic noise when the animals came close. I picked up the slim white box and handed it to him.

And it hurts the foxes? Dad said.

The lady crossed her arms. It’s very uncomfortable for them yes.

I know they must have traps for foxes, Dad said later, when we were in the car. Maybe you can look on the internet and see if there’s one we can build. We can try this ultrasonic thing first but I think we’ll need something more vigorous.

I’ll do that, I said, another project.

By the time we got back I was tired. Dad went straight to the garage to put on his wellies. I went upstairs to wash my hands and he waved at me from the garden, looking much happier. When I went back down he was on the phone. He saw me and pressed the phone to his cheek, scratching his bald head.

Your Uncle’s dead, he said. A car crash. Someone hit him while he was parked.

 

–

 

My dad baked a Victoria sponge to take with us. Both my grandparents were dead but I had never really known them, them living in Nigeria, and I could only remember meeting them a few times. I had seen Uncle not long ago and I could see his face still in my mind very clearly. It made me weak to think there was no longer a real counterpart to my memories of him, that his face was the face of a corpse now.

Other relatives were in Uncle’s kitchen, they were in the hallway and the living room, compiling paperwork, cooking food, on the phone to work outside, but even with all the people there was a white peace in the house like a church at night, after the service is over and the wine and the host has been packed away and all that’s left is the smell of incense and the light through the stained glass windows. Chioma was on the couch trying to watch television. Dad put his arm around her. For a second she didn’t realise he was there.

I’m so sorry, he said.

How was the drive over, she said. Was it fine?

Dad shrugged. Chioma nodded. She looked up suddenly, as though hearing something upstairs.

Did you hear?

Yes. Yes Chioma.

No, she shook her head. Did you hear?

No.

I got the phone call this morning. Bolaji had a family in Lagos. A wife and three kids. She changed the channel. I always said, you know, if he wanted kids we could adopt one. After what happened. And then, when we had money, I said we should do IVF.

My dad put the cake down on the coffee table.

Can you believe it? Chioma went on. Thirty-four years of marriage. His oldest child is twenty. Twenty years old.

Jesus. Twenty years.

My mother and I looked at each other and back at Chioma on the couch. She looked out of her body with grief.

What a husband I had.

She changed the channel.

Bami! She called, there’s food in the kitchen.

I nodded at her but didn’t move. The flow of tears subsided. She looked directly at my dad’s face.

Did you know? She said.

Know what?

What do you mean what, she said calmly. What else?

I don’t know what you’re talking about.

What else would I be talking about?

He wiped his hand on his trouser, shifted in his seat. He raised his eyebrows, inviting her to continue speaking, to clarify again.

Oh okay, she said. I understand. You think I’m an idiot. You think you can come here and lie to my face. You and Bolaji were probably laughing about it for years. Just keep it going, another year, let’s see how far we can push our luck with this mumu. You feel bad now, abi? Okay. You will never feel good again.

My dad was rubbing his brow. He was looking across Chioma, into thin air. Her neck tensed, a smile on her face.

That’s fine, she said. But if you think I believe that nonsense look on your face you must be an idiot.

There was silence, the others in the house had stopped speaking. I kept wondering why he wasn’t moving. He mumbled something, getting to his feet, Chioma said in an even voice that things would not be well with him and that he would not live to see the fruit of his labours. She threw the TV remote and went on cursing, louder now, as the three of us went for the door. She threw the Victoria sponge at us and it landed in the vestibule and the plate shattered and sprayed shards on our legs. We got into the car and drove home.

    "text": "From the threshold of the living room Diana observed the blonde who was presiding over the party. The room was held in a hush, and the woman on the couch twisted her hands as she spoke, until a laugh broke out and she touched her fingers to her hair.

Diana shouldered her way into the living room as the laughter quieted. The blonde was seated in the center of a large sofa, cradling a half-empty tumbler and touching thighs with a bearded man who had begun speaking to her about something apparently urgent.

‘Who is that?’ Diana said to the woman beside her.

She gestured toward the blonde with her beer bottle. ‘That’s Lucy,’ she said.

Lucy wore a white tank top in which her breasts stood at attention, like loyal little pets, and she had the cheekbones and eyelashes that Diana associated with rarified, glossy womanhood.

The woman standing beside Diana introduced herself while on the sofa the blonde, Lucy, toyed absently with her necklace. Diana moved toward Lucy and softly touched the edge of the sofa.

‘Excuse me,’ Diana said to Lucy. She and the bearded man beside her both turned expectantly. ‘Could I get you another drink?’

A mild, appropriate blush washed across Lucy’s face. She was clearly used to being sought. ‘Sure. You know,’ she said to Diana, ‘I could use another drink, I’ll come with you. Okay?’ she said to the man, and rested her hand on his forearm for a moment, like a teacher reassuring a young boy that he will be just fine on his own.

Diana smiled, as much at this gesture as at Lucy’s acquiescence. As she led Lucy to the kitchen, her silver ring and the links of her watch gleaming against Lucy’s white top, she turned to see a crestfallen look in the eyes of the man on the sofa – a look that made her laugh out loud.

‘What?’ Lucy said.

‘Your friend,’ Diana said. ‘I think he’s jealous. What are you having?’

‘A gin and tonic, please.’

Diana arranged the bottles and located a knife in a kitchen drawer. She began to slice a lime. ‘I haven’t seen you here before,’ she said, indicating the apartment. ‘How do you know Minta?’

‘We went to high school together,’ Lucy said. ‘I only moved here recently, we haven’t seen each other in years. It was sweet of her to invite me.’

‘I think it was more a favor to us than to you,’ Diana said.

Lucy turned around on her heels, smiled, splayed her hands on the kitchen counter and leaned forward as though she were about to announce a dare. Diana saw that Lucy’s appeal was in the nostalgia of her looks: Hers was a teen beauty, at home nowhere more than in a miniskirt. Even in her bland slacks and loafers she had the flirtatious, dismissive charm of a girl at the height of her popularity, the challenge and invincibility of a team captain.

Diana poured the tonic into Lucy’s glass. When Diana was a teenager, no girl had ever given her the look Lucy gave her now. After an adolescence in which the very fact of her lesbianism had seemed to disqualify her from the contest of desire, she had, in her brief adulthood in the city, finally become attractive. She had natural qualities that hadn’t initially looked like advantages – height, broad shoulders and a face given to brooding – and she had learned to appropriate the mannerisms that made powerful men suspicious and irresistible, chief among them a degree of directness to which the world capitulated almost unconsciously. The spin, the smile, the crush of Lucy’s tits in the tank top: Diana recognized all this now with the wistfulness of a former adolescent boy who had once jacked off, in frustration, to a teen flick. In an hour she would make this bitch come around her fingers, and that’s how she would say goodbye to it once and for all – those excruciating sexless years – the slurs, the nights spent crying, the year she had starved herself and, perhaps worst of all, the relentless, disgusting, unconsummated wetness she had carried around between her legs, which marked her as an animal.

‘You know,’ Lucy said, taking a sip of her fresh drink, ‘I’m glad I came. I’m making friends already.’

Diana came around to Lucy’s side of the counter and placed her hand on the back of Lucy’s neck, where a light sweat had begun to collect. She could feel the thrum of intention beating in her own chest and along the muscles of her arms. There in the warm kitchen she let her ring rest against the first vertebra of Lucy’s spine and later, after the long charged walk to Diana’s apartment, when Lucy was supine on her bed, she felt with satisfaction the moment when the hard alien contour of the ring surprised Lucy, made her hitch her hips up before she could catch herself. Lucy smiled, to show she was game. From there Diana did what she had learned to do: make a girl feel absolutely surrounded, alternately by forcefulness and by utter softness, as though she were smothered in Diana’s desire. Diana could tell which kinds of girls would like this and which would find it overwhelming, and she intuited that Lucy’s capacity to receive passion had been so distorted by her excessive beauty that only a real showing would satisfy her. At the very end she crouched between Lucy’s legs and began to pet her softly, almost as though at any minute she would give it up. She kept at this for so long that Lucy began to shake, to say raggedly, no more, no more until, just a few moments later, she came with a humiliating trembling in her legs, her body splayed and limp like an empty bag.

‘Christ,’ Lucy said a while afterward, wiping her brow. A dank, sweet smell of success permeated the room.

‘You’ve never been fucked by a woman, have you?’ Diana said.

Lucy laughed – a lovely ripple, her breasts shaking – and then she turned, propped herself up on an elbow. ‘Did you really think that?’ she said. ‘Why do you think I came home with you?’

Diana made a neutral face. So who was that man Lucy had been sitting thigh-to-thigh beside, whose forearm she had touched so awfully – someone she teased for sport? The idea made Diana like Lucy better, maybe even grudgingly respect her. When Lucy left it was with shameless grace, the air of having won something flattering and inconsequential.

In the morning Diana made her way out for a coffee. She felt light and free. She was at home in the blare of traffic, roaming across blocks that smelled of bacon fat and sewage. The sun moved over her, confirming her strength. When she checked her phone, she saw that Minta had texted her. I heard you went home with Lucy! she wrote. Isn’t she special??

As Diana ascended the stairs back up to her apartment the word special echoed in her mind and conjured the disheveled hallway, the hush, the sight of Lucy glimpsed across the bay of heads, the spin of Lucy’s body as if she were suspended over a football pitch.

 

Lucy had been in the city three months. Sure, she said on the phone, she would let Diana show her around. Where did Diana like to go?

‘Well, now that the pools have opened, I like to go to the pools.’

‘You just want to see me in a swimsuit.’

Diana waited for her on Houston Street outside the entrance to Hamilton Fish. The early summer was yellow and jubilant. Lucy arrived wearing a competition one-piece under a denim skirt, carrying nothing but a water bottle and a small makeup kit tied around her wrist. Diana felt a keen satisfaction surveying Lucy’s proportions, the rightness of her shoulders, her waist, even the smart length of her hair.

‘You’ll have to share my towel, is that it?’ Diana said from behind her sunglasses.

The pool was filled with children celebrating their release from school, rowdy and irrepressible. Diana spread her single towel down at the far end and they sat together at the edge, their calves dangling in the water. The pool, protected and bejeweled, spread out before them in its vastness. The sound of traffic on Houston was distant yet comforting.

‘How do you know this place?’ Lucy said.

‘I know all the pools,’ Diana said.

‘Why don’t you go to the beach?’

Diana didn’t explain that she only felt safe in Manhattan, hugged between the rivers, aware at all times of what was up and what was down. She leaned into the reticence which had by now become natural to her, and which took on an air of glamour when paired with bravado. Lucy had no trouble keeping them both entertained. She had a keen memory for what were apparently years’ worth of stolen anecdotes, bar stories, family secrets. Her brother was a frequent protagonist: his troubles, his cruelty, the things he had stolen, the people her father had called to keep him out of prison.

In the second hour, while Lucy’s voice sped along over the contours of past summers, Diana noticed a pair of adolescent girls staring at them across a stretch of shallow water. The girls were long-haired, silky and full of themselves in pink bikinis which presumed more adulthood than belonged to them, and they alternated between whispers and shrieks. ‘But he just did it again the next month,’ Lucy was saying. ‘Can you believe that?’ Across the pool the bolder girl pointed at her, Diana, and gave a high laugh. Diana felt heavy. Her shoulders were too hulking even to remain upright. She hated the girls, their dark eyes and spoiled smiles, and simultaneously she felt grateful to them for their ruthless obedience to the truth. She made the smoothest possible entrance into the safety of the water, so that only her head was visible, and circled around in front of Lucy, shielding her eyes with her hand. Lucy talked charmingly. She hadn’t noticed anything.

As June meandered into July, Diana introduced Lucy to the Manhattan pools. On Saturdays they tried to visit two or three in a single afternoon. As they trekked on the subway from one set of locker rooms to the next, damp-haired and giddy with chlorine, Lucy outshone whatever else was on offer in the growing summer heat. The freckled tan on her chest had no rival. And the fifteen seconds of the weekend Diana cherished most were those in which she spread a triangle of sunscreen onto Lucy’s upper back: She felt the pressure of Lucy’s muscles straining toward her and the brute inside her shivered.

Lucy enjoyed those miserable cold showers at the pool, she laughed at the ads on the subway, she smiled at the idiot kids who raced around her street on scooters and nearly pushed her into traffic while she coolly produced her building key and shouted, like an overworked sister, ‘Don’t forget to drink some water!’ When Diana, ravenous by the time she got Lucy into bed at seven or eight in the evening, bruised Lucy’s hips without meaning to, Lucy liked this too.

Falling in love was the just reward for Diana’s years of stoicism, for all that grief that had not, in fact, been wasted, because it had yielded her this golden future. But doubts arose after Lucy fell asleep. Diana began to have thoughts that hadn’t troubled her in recent years, during which she had been so callous toward women that she had no need to be afraid of them. If it was the case that when she was a teenager she had been greedy, tactless, wounded, ugly – for she must have been all those, to have been so hated – it was inevitable that those qualities were still lying in wait beneath all her established charms, her boldness and her polished style, her significant silences, the shoulders which she had learned to hold just so. Since she had come to the city she had never disclosed to anyone this ghost that clung to her: the person she had been before. While Lucy slept in the cave of her arm, smelling of Coppertone and the lemon juice she combed into her hair, Diana looked around at the possessions which attested to the extremity of her solitude. The clock above her closet was not accurate, since no one consulted it; the costumes which were her city clothes hung flaccid and emptied of their authority. All these allures she pretended to, the allures that had ensnared Lucy, would soon be discarded as false tricks.

This doubt was a slender cup into which Lucy’s desire fell. Didn’t Lucy call Diana first thing on Saturday mornings and sometimes on weekday afternoons, too? Didn’t Lucy ask Diana about her favorite candies and which breeds of dog she admired when they passed gaggles on the sidewalk? Didn’t Lucy let her fingers linger on Diana’s waistband at the poolside? Diana’s mother, a timid woman who was unequal to what life demanded of her, had said only one meaningful thing about what Diana had endured: that adulthood would be more forgiving. Diana had not believed her, but she had prayed that her own skepticism would be contradicted. And perhaps Lucy was proof that her mother had a little wisdom.

While Lucy was on her arm, among her friends, Diana’s doubt struck her as insubstantial, like a memory left over from another world. Nothing fortified Diana so much as attending a party with Lucy. While lounging beside Lucy on that same sofa in Minta’s apartment, at a party later that summer, Diana felt the warm, lazy safety of a lizard in the sun. She was listening to Lucy and Minta talk about their hometown in Ohio. They had known each other in school, but they hadn’t been friends. ‘I always liked you,’ Minta said, ‘but you were just so popular. No one could get near you,’ and Lucy said, teasingly, ‘But you did get near me!’ and the two of them laughed.

‘The whole thing was just awful,’ Minta said. She looked tired and edging past her prime. Smoking had loosened her skin. In her voice high school seemed especially distant, a place far beyond the rivers. ‘Wasn’t it?’

‘Oh, it was high school,’ Lucy said. ‘It’s so bizarre. Nothing about it made sense. Right?’ And she began to describe the hierarchies and misplaced priorities and the intense, impossible passion she had felt inside herself then, all the time, the sense that she was filled with a manic energy which could only be temporarily relieved through athletics or teary conflict-resolutions. She described this with laughter and a little bashfulness, as though it were embarrassing, in retrospect, how important everything had seemed. Then Lucy said to Minta: ‘Do you remember Isabel?’

‘Isabel Walker?’

‘Isabel Garcia. Who came when we were sophomores?’

‘Barely.’

‘The thing I really remember about high school, to be honest, is how in love with her I was,’ Lucy said. ‘The first girl I was really in love with.’

‘Isabel Garcia?’ Minta said. ‘Really?’

By the time Isabel had moved to town, Lucy said, she had been worrying over her attraction to girls. But when she met Isabel it was undeniable. They got to talking during a biology class and met regularly in the evenings, at each other’s houses, for months. At school they didn’t acknowledge each other. God, it was harrowing to think of now, Lucy explained, since she had been so in love with Isabel, and yet at the time she felt she had no choice but to deny it.

Lucy and Isabel had agreed that their relationship would be an absolute secret: Neither of them was interested in being branded among their classmates. In order to facilitate their cover, they agreed that they were allowed to have boyfriends. Isabel was too busy to have a boyfriend; she spent her afternoons playing soccer on the JV team. But Lucy had a boyfriend already, the first in a series, and she really did feel warmly toward him. Their first explorations had been sweet – his inherent gentleness, her obliging fascination with his penis. But her interest in him was not comparable to her feelings for Isabel. Nights after she had spent a few hours with her boyfriend, she would sneak into Isabel’s house, just two blocks from her own, and spend hours writhing on a basement sofa with Isabel. Isabel was madly in love with Lucy, too. Once, Lucy recounted, she and Isabel had stolen some time together in the back of Isabel’s mother’s car in the afternoon, while her mother was inside speaking to an administrator, and Lucy had pulled on Isabel’s jersey in her hurry to dress before Isabel’s mother returned. Afterward when Lucy went to her boyfriend’s house her boyfriend said, What’s that you’ve got on? Lucy was beside herself with fear that he would realize it was Isabel’s jersey and find her out. But he quickly forgot.

By this point people on the couches around Lucy were listening. Her ability to captivate a room could not be attributed to her beauty alone; perhaps it was that fierce energy she recounted from her teenage years channeled into a new adult expression, animating her face and hands.

‘And what happened in the end?’ someone asked. ‘Between you and Isabel?’

It went on like this for a year, Lucy explained, and by then she had a different boyfriend. Isabel never got a boyfriend of her own. She was heartsick. She was starting to suspect that maybe it wasn’t all bullshit between Lucy and her boyfriend – that maybe there was something real in it. While Lucy was with her boyfriend Isabel would text her constantly, and when she failed to respond Isabel would grow by turns teary and livid. She would approach Lucy’s friends in the halls or the cafeteria and ask: Was Lucy all right? Had they heard from her? But her friends hadn’t known that Isabel and Lucy even knew each other, and this made Lucy terrifically anxious. What am I supposed to do? she said to Isabel. Even though we know it’s fake, he doesn’t! What else can I do?

One evening the boyfriend slept over at Lucy’s house. The two of them were woken in the darkness by Isabel standing over the bed. Lucy and Isabel knew all the back routes into each other’s houses, they knew how to find the hide-a-keys and the loose window sashes even in the dark. You sleep with him? Isabel shouted. With him? Isabel had watched them go to bed from the street, through the window. Lucy forced Isabel out of the house before her parents realized, but the boyfriend knew something strange had happened. In the dark he hadn’t recognized Isabel. But he had heard her. Who was that? he asked when Lucy returned to bed. Lucy, in her panic, could only say: My brother, it was just my brother, go back to sleep.

She and Isabel never spoke after that. Lucy’s boyfriend was confused and alarmed, however much she tried to placate him, and could not decipher the truth of what had happened. They broke up. Later, at a party, Lucy’s friends drunkenly accused her of sleeping with Isabel: What are you doing with that girl? they said. Don’t you know it’s obvious? It was the performance of her life, acting as though that rumor was so absurd it could only embarrass those who repeated it. When inwardly, of course, she was terrified of anyone discovering the truth.

Lucy paused and looked at Minta. ‘Did you know, did you hear about me and Isabel back then?’

Minta had heard rumors about Lucy, but there were rumors about girls all the time, she hadn’t believed it, she remembered merely being afraid of the day when the rumor would concern her, Minta. It was clear why Minta and Lucy had been afraid. After that week when she had asked around after Lucy, Isabel was teased and mocked relentlessly where before she had been ignored. Once she was surrounded by a group of boys and dragged down to the pool, where they threw her in the water along with the contents of her backpack.

But – it was strange, Lucy admitted, she had never understood it – if Isabel was targeted for her relationship with Lucy, Lucy herself, after that terrifying moment at the party, was never accused of having anything to do with Isabel again. And in fact, in the years afterward, she slept with other girls at school, very quietly, with none of the obsession or emotion she had felt for Isabel, and no one was the wiser.

‘How many?’ Minta said, with a look of admiration. ‘I mean, that time that we kissed, I thought that was a crazy thing, for both of us.’

‘Oh, I don’t know,’ Lucy said. ‘Ten? Fifteen? But I didn’t get over Isabel. It was all just kind of sad. But I felt like I had to do it. I was trying to feel free, or to like myself, or something. Even secretly.’

Lucy laughed and made a rueful face to show everyone listening that there was no reason to feel sorry for her. It was all so far in the past that it seemed silly to even think of it now.

The room grew loud again with the sounds of other people’s conversations. ‘I could use another drink, baby,’ Lucy said, her hand landing lightly on Diana’s thigh. Diana trembled. She rose and turned toward the kitchen, but Lucy pulled her back.

‘Wait,’ she said. Lucy’s lashes were long and delicate and evenly spaced, and she looked up at Diana from beneath them. ‘You don’t think I’m terrible for all that stuff, do you? What happened in high school? Because, you know, I’ve never treated anyone like that since – I would never treat anyone that way now, the way I treated Isabel. You know that, right?’

‘Of course,’ Diana said. She went to Minta’s kitchen, found the lime, cleaned the knife.

When she had made her excuses to Lucy she hurried home and by some instinct double-locked the door behind her. She was up all night considering it. Lucy was a type she had never imagined before: a girl who, by virtue of charm and a willingness to give blowjobs, managed not only to remain popular and beloved in her adolescence but, throughout that time, to conduct secret liaisons with the other closeted ice cream scoopers and lifeguards of her hometown, sneaking around in cars and public bathrooms and finished basements in an ecstasy from which she emerged only to repeat, at the next house party, the slurs to which she herself was never subjected. And not only this, but Lucy had graduated from this small-town regime of covert and ecstatic hedonism into life in the city, where she was praised for her lesbianism and instantly forgiven the mistakes of her youth. How many girls like this had existed in Diana’s own hometown? How many had there been in any town Diana had driven through, in the towns where she had gone to play soccer? Had they only been the most beautiful girls, the most popular girls? But they couldn’t have been, because there had been the kinds of girls Lucy had fooled around with, too, the girls like Isabel and Minta who she wouldn’t acknowledge at school. And for Diana there had been nothing – only the apparent senselessness of coming out at fifteen, which she had thought noble, and the loneliness she had believed would never leave her. She felt, at the time, that there was no choice about coming out. Everything had seemed so incontrovertible; it had not occurred to her to conceal her impulses, nor did she think she could have. She was too self-righteous to entertain conflicted feelings. And even though she hadn’t intended to come out, hadn’t Isabel been just like Diana – principled, unflinching in her sexuality, unable to stomach even the charade of a boyfriend, tortured by her classmates for these very qualities?

It wasn’t Lucy who had called Isabel names and thrown her into the pool. But wasn’t she responsible? Wasn’t it true that both Isabel and Diana had suffered at the hands of girls like Lucy, perhaps even more so than at the hands of their straight classmates, because it was girls like Lucy who might have helped them, if they had had the strength or the selflessness? No one could have hated Lucy, even if she had come out. The lives of girls like Diana would have been infinitely easier, if only one girl that everyone envied had stood up and said, It’s me you’re talking about.

Early in the morning Diana let herself out onto her stoop, lit a cigarette, and called Minta. On the third try Minta answered. ‘It’s six o’clock, Di,’ she said. ‘Is there an emergency?’

‘Listen,’ Diana said. ‘Aren’t you even a little mad at Lucy? I mean, don’t you think she could’ve – I don’t know – don’t you think it was fucked up, what she put Isabel through? And you too! You kissed, and she acted like it never happened.’

‘So did I,’ Minta said. ‘We were basically children. Did Lucy put you up to this? Is she freaked out or something?’

‘No –’

‘Diana, we can’t talk about Isabel Garcia at six a.m. I’m sorry. Go back to sleep.’

Diana smoked until she was sick and then she ran a couple of miles to remind herself that her experiment with weakness was over. It was Saturday. In a few hours Lucy would call her with that coy, thrilling edge to her voice to ask, ‘Where should we go today?’ – which almost persuaded Diana that she finally belonged in this elevated social realm which she had feared she’d never enter: the realm in which men were rich and women were beautiful, and the frail ugly underbelly of human life was only pavement over which she rode in a powerful car.

 

They went to the Dry Dock Pool. Lucy wore a white swimsuit which was too bright to look at directly, and which Diana could only take in by holding up her camera: Lucy belonged in that little screen. Diana felt the absurdity of having believed she might belong on a little screen, too, at full brightness.

‘God, when Minta said you were special, I had no idea,’ Diana told her when they were in the water.

Lucy smiled without surprise. ‘What do you mean?’

‘You know what I mean,’ Diana said. She swam up to where Lucy sat with her legs dangling at the edge of the pool and pulled herself up between Lucy’s knees. ‘Haven’t you noticed I’m falling for you?’

This was the way to say it to a girl like Lucy: like it was a challenge, like the girl was at risk of being made a fool. You couldn’t be mistaken as a beggar or a suitor. You couldn’t offer it up like a free gift.

‘Are you asking to be my girlfriend?’ Lucy said.

‘I’m not asking,’ Diana said, grinning, so that it was like a joke between them. ‘What else do you think I am?’

Oh, she had been right, right about every single thing. Lucy bit her lip, squeezed her knees around Diana’s waist. Around them were the shouts of ‘No diving!’, the blare of a horn on an adjacent block. Lucy laughed, and then said, with a plump, impish kiss – ‘Well, I guess it’s official.’

In the weeks that followed, when Diana made those love confessions she had never made before and heard Lucy return them, she was thinking of Isabel Garcia. These were the slick lashes Isabel had seen when she admitted her devotion. This was the trembling mouth from which Isabel had heard those impossible words – I love you, I love you – this was the frenzied energy with which Isabel’s face and neck had been covered with kisses. This was the obscene, perfect body which Isabel had lain beneath on the couch in the basement, this was the spot at the small of the waist where Isabel had pressed her hands. Lucy was so intoxicating that in moments Diana almost believed in the love she was imitating, she felt suffused by Isabel’s passion. Then she remembered to ask herself: What had Lucy’s face looked like in the hallway, in the cafeteria, with her boyfriend’s arm slung over her shoulders? Had Isabel been picturing that passing face when Lucy nuzzled her in the basement? When Lucy sighed, had Isabel envisioned her knees on a sticky carpet, blonde strands caught against her cheeks, her mouth stretched around a purple cock?

 

‘Ishould’ve known you’d go for a girl like her,’ Minta said to Diana at their neighborhood diner. By then the summer had meandered into its dog days.

‘A girl like what?’

‘A men’s-fantasy girl. The kind of girl you have to fight over at the bar. Who likes it when men fight over her.’

‘Was that what that whole Isabel story was about?’

‘The thing about Isabel Garcia?’ Minta said. ‘I don’t think so. I appreciated her honesty about all that. What could any of us do back then except try to get through it? Kimmy’s the only person I’ve met who’s all smiles about it,’ she said. Kimmy was her girlfriend. ‘She talks about high school like it was so cozy, just being with her family. And you’ve never complained about those years either. You have no idea what it was like for me and Lucy, the town we grew up in.’ She shook her head, as though to shake herself awake. ‘Has something happened between the two of you?’

‘Not really. I just thought that story was kind of an attention-whore thing.’

Minta rolled her eyes. ‘Come on. You were obsessed with her about ten minutes ago.’

Diana wondered: Did Lucy confide in Minta about the canceled dates – the way Diana sometimes left before midnight, as though she had somewhere else to be – the times Diana screened her calls – the way Diana hid the face of her phone when they lay next to each other? Had Lucy begun to notice?

In the bottom of her mind, where her slender doubt lived, Diana felt again the imperviousness that had sheltered her in the past few years. When she looked at her phone she saw that Lucy had texted her, but she put off responding. Probably Lucy had never waited half a day, let alone a full one, on delivered. But Diana knew how it felt: the rereading, the ambivalence, the follow-up text, the sickening daydreams. What was especially painful was the moment in which that breezy response finally came and immediately it was all rescinded – everything you had felt – the dark and lonely futures you deserved which had opened up before you like tunnels – and within minutes you believed wholeheartedly that you had never worried at all, that you had always been busy, happy, disinterested.

 

On the eve of Lucy’s birthday, in August, Diana arrived on her stoop bearing flowers and a wrapped jewelry box. Lucy answered with surprise. They had been seeing a little less of each other, owing to Diana’s new, contrived avoidance; they had exhausted the local pools. Their relationship had become almost casual again, and because this is not the natural order of intimacy there was an awkwardness to it.

Lucy took the flowers from Diana. They sat at a little table by her kitchen window, the air hot and fragrant, the sounds of the subway serving as gentle reminders to Diana that she belonged to the streets and the underground, as a stray animal belongs. Lucy unwrapped the chain bracelet Diana had brought, and Diana clasped it for her. The sight of Lucy’s fine hand, which Diana had so craved when she had seen it touch the forearm of the bearded man, was overwhelming. She lifted Lucy up onto the windowsill and softly lifted her dress. She breathed to Lucy that she loved her.

Lucy kissed Diana on her cheeks, on her neck.

Diana could feel the presence of doubt glimmering between them, a wariness in the compact, gracious way Lucy held her body. It terrified her that Lucy’s gestures claimed to emanate a warmth which Diana could not feel. Yet this wariness was the effect Diana had hoped for over the previous weeks. She reminded herself that power and terror went hand in hand, that any extreme sense of supremacy or impotence was a place from which other people looked distant and unlikely, and could not be understood.

The next day a picnic was being held in the park to celebrate Lucy’s birthday. Diana went out for beer and arrived late. In the meadow she lingered among her friends, said hello to Minta. Lucy, radiant in a sleeveless red dress, was surrounded by well-wishers and little coolers of ice cream and drinks.

‘She really can be a bit over the top,’ Minta said as she watched Lucy gesticulate, with a frown that made Diana’s heart punch up. It was she who had done this – changed Minta’s mind.

When Lucy finally spotted her Diana steeled herself. She touched her silver ring and dug her heels into the ground. Lucy made her way through two groups of girls, smiling, touching forearms gently, until she reached Diana’s side and leaned forward to kiss her. At that moment Diana put her hands in her pockets and leaned away.

Lucy’s face shifted. Diana could see confusion rise and alongside it something worse – what she thought was resignation – as though, while a part of Lucy could not believe it, another part of her had been expecting this. Once again Lucy moved to embrace Diana and once again Diana leaned away, as if Lucy were contagious.

‘What are you doing?’ Diana said.

Minta was watching them silently. Lucy raised her hand again. It hovered there for a moment.

‘Aren’t you going to wish me a happy birthday?’ she said finally.

Diana laughed and said to Minta, ‘What’s going on with her? She’s obsessed with me.’

Lucy’s waist as she walked away was haunting in its sweetness, so too her shoulders which had grown freckled on their poolside afternoons. Diana closed her eyes against the sight. She heard the faint hiss of a can opening, and Minta’s voice saying, ‘Diana, what the fuck?’

She had wanted urgently for Lucy to comprehend some shadow, at least, of what she herself had inflicted on a girl she claimed to love – some semblance of that anxiety, that despair, finally that violent public rejection, not just rejection but in fact the denial of any involvement at all. Diana was certain that now some essential balance would be restored. It was not for some people to suffer everything, and others nothing. Not while she had her wits and her resources.

She opened her eyes to glimpse Lucy just disappearing over a small hill at the edge of the meadow and felt instead, with gravity, her own regret. The sight of Lucy’s back seemed to radiate pain. This was what she had intended. But for what had she punished Lucy? If not to offer her the chance to step down from her rarified place, deepen her empathy, show she was human?

She found Lucy on a bench beyond the meadow, where the picnickers would not see her. Facing the bench was an artificial lake crossed by a little stone bridge. Diana sat beside Lucy, took her hand between her two palms and kneaded it. Lucy allowed her hand to be taken. The sun moved over Lucy’s cheekbones and lashes, over the red folds of her dress and the skin of the lake. Diana was beginning to comprehend Lucy’s experience: So this was what it felt like to inflict pain and to participate in it. This was what it was to relish power and – she watched pain and shame battling in the jaggedness and trembling of Lucy’s lips – to simultaneously regret it. She felt a profound sense of understanding settle over her, her body anchored itself against the bench, and she held Lucy’s hand more tightly. How could she have been so stupid, how could she have hoped she and Lucy would love each other, when they couldn’t yet understand each other? She had known nothing of Lucy’s effortless power, and Lucy had known nothing of the obscure, miserable frustration of being excluded from the contest of love. She could feel in the tangle of her fingers that Lucy was experiencing this breadth of empathy too. The past seemed to retreat to a small and pivotal place in the distance. Diana would forgive Lucy for the story of Isabel, and Lucy would forgive her for this ruined birthday.

Tears crept down Lucy’s face. She held Diana’s hand more tightly. The bracelet Diana had given her was hot against their entwined wrists. ‘God,’ she said. Diana held her.

‘I have to go back,’ Lucy said then, freeing Diana’s hand.

Diana couldn’t go back over the hill yet. ‘I’ll come tonight,’ she said. Lucy walked with square shoulders, her back held straight.

That evening Diana walked to Lucy’s apartment with a fierce, rare feeling of joy. Tonight Lucy would repent for what she had done to Isabel, and Diana could made amends and show her sincere self to Lucy: the self which had not always been rakish but had once been outcast, the same self which loved Lucy and forgave her. But she found, when she arrived, that there was no answer. Perhaps Lucy had drunk too much at the picnic and passed out already, or lost track of time at some party?

Diana waited half an hour in the warm darkness, aware that she was in the grip of a hopeful, piteous devotion to which she had hoped to be invulnerable. Then she walked home and slept with the windows open.

In the morning she went back to Lucy’s. The sun moved over her, and she felt hopeful and lightly sick. She rang Lucy’s bell four times. Finally Lucy appeared on the stoop. She was still wearing the red dress, though it had suffered some grass stains since the previous afternoon. Diana remembered the immaculate desire she had felt when she first encountered Lucy, fervent and doubtless, and the greedy pleasure of watching her bewitch a whole room. She reached out to embrace her.

‘Don’t touch me!’ Lucy said, pushing the hand away. Her face was tight. ‘Why are you here? Why the fuck are you here right now?’

‘Won’t you just have a cigarette with me?’ Diana said, after a moment. ‘Please, come outside?’

They walked a block in silence. At the corner Diana bought a pack and a lighter and they stood under the bodega sign together in a raw breeze. Lucy’s lashes were clumped together a little, but Diana loved her no less.

‘Why are you here?’ Lucy said, waving the lighter around. ‘You’ve been shitty to me for a month! And what the fuck was that in the park yesterday? Okay, I get it, you don’t want to be with me anymore, but did you have to shit on me in front of my friends, on my fucking birthday? Couldn’t you just tell me like a human being?’

‘But that’s not what’s going on, not at all,’ Diana said. ‘I do want to be with you, I just – I thought –’ and she stopped. She looked at Lucy. ‘You don’t understand,’ she said, ‘do you? This is about Isabel.’

‘Isabel?’ said Lucy. ‘Isabel who?’

‘Isabel Garcia!’

Lucy squinted at Diana. ‘Do you know her?’ she said. ‘Do you know Isabel from somewhere?’

‘No, I was trying to show you – I wanted you to understand. About high school. What it was like for Isabel. What it felt like if you were gay then, and if you –’

‘High school?’ Lucy flicked ashes onto Diana’s shirt. ‘High school?’

 

Diana could make it over the bridge, out of Manhattan, all the way down to Sunset Pool. She knew where the river was; it had only switched sides.

If she lay on her back at the poolside and braced the concrete, with a shirt draped over her face to shield the sun, she became a part of the wide, generous summer. She could hear the size of the pool, the moods of the children shouting, the little dives that splashed the water up and the obligatory shouts of the lifeguards. Early September: The air had a bright, soft sound to it. The cry of the whistle was silver.

When the sun had exhausted her, she gathered her things and went to the bank of showers. She rinsed her face in the stream. She heard the slap of flip-flops, the dull sound of metal keys. Then she heard the voice she knew was Minta’s saying, ‘No, put that under the towel, over there.’

She turned and saw Minta and her girlfriend, still dry, with their arms full of towels and magazines.

She shook the water from her hair and moved toward Minta. She didn’t feel afraid. She had crossed the bridge and drunk up all that light. Adulthood was more forgiving. ‘Hey,’ she said, and touched Minta’s arm. Minta turned toward her. Her cheeks grew taut with surprise, the aging looseness of her face disappeared, and as her mouth curled with disgust she looked as fresh and livid as she must have at sixteen."

    "text": "It’s 11:03 now, so Betty Lane is late. I’m waiting in my rented Ford Escape – its AC sputtering through the early June heat – thinking of calling again or maybe abandoning my attempt to get inside Jane’s house. Hers is the last on this cul-de-sac, a street lined with mini mansions that mirror one another. I thought Jane would hate the suburbs, how one house blends into the next. But sitting here, I can understand the appeal. It’s nice to be alike, to be so similar you’re almost one.

Three weeks ago, I left the city. I’d planned to knock on Jane’s door, to try and reconnect, to repair what had been broken. But as I was pacing this street, working myself up to it, I heard a garage open, and there she was. I ducked behind the neighbors’ hedges and watched her walk down the driveway. Through the boxwood, I could tell her hair was several bottles blonder. She looked like she’d gained weight. Her eyebrows were thicker, darker, maybe laminated. She was wearing a pink sundress – she hates pink – and I realized as she picked up the newspaper how much time could pass in a year. It occurred to me that I no longer knew her.

So I booked myself a room at the Motel 6 and I waited. Until I learned more, until I understood why she’d left. Until this morning, when I found that a ‘for sale’ sign had, overnight, materialized on her lawn. The poster – a woman’s headshot, eyes blown up to ten times their natural size, lips big and red, wet with parabens – said ‘Betty Lane Real Estate’ in small script, followed by a telephone number.

When I called Betty about a tour, I used my best accent. I’d be a southern housewife after Jessica Tandy in Driving Miss Daisy, which I’d just watched at the motel. As I waited for Betty to check her schedule – acrylic nails click-clacking against computer keys – I considered my character like we’d done in theater school. Who was she? What did she want?

‘I can put you down for eleven this morning,’ Betty interrupted. ‘Your name again?’

‘Jessica,’ I said, committing. ‘Jessica Tandy.’

My phone reads 11:09. I thumb aimlessly through the pages of apps, forward then back, hovering above the mail icon before pressing it. One of my clients has messaged a third time about her new installation in Bushwick that’s been panned. Another is worried about the growing hate he’s received after copying a small creator on Etsy. Unread emails: 62. Outside of New York, I found it difficult to care. I watch the screen go black only for another ping to illuminate it. Doing PR for artists has to be a kind of masochism.

I wipe the sweat off my upper lip, chuck the phone into a cup holder. This was a mistake. What do I expect Jane’s house will reveal? Why she cut me off? Proof she hadn’t meant to? With a hand on the gear shift, now slick with moisture, I’m about to put the car into drive when a knock echoes off my passenger-side window. Peering inside, clad in an ill-fitting black pantsuit, is Betty Lane. Her eyes are smaller in person. She wears no lipstick, has no acrylic nails. What’s more, her belly is swollen to the size of a cantaloupe. I press the window switch, and we both watch the glass jerk awkwardly down.

‘Jessica?’

‘Yes?’ I say, sweeping the curls out of my eyes. ‘How’d you know it was me?’

‘Well . . .’ She glances around the empty street. ‘No one else here, ma’am.’

‘Silly me, sometimes I, uh, ain’t got the sense God gave a lemon!’

Betty coughs politely. ‘Shall we?’

I reluctantly release the wet gear shift and get out of the car, drying my hand on my pants. Following Betty up the drive, I stay several feet behind, stopping on the porch as she approaches Jane’s door. Flanked by two artificial ferns, she begins fishing around her large leather tote while I scan the road, tapping one of my sneakers, suddenly aware they don’t match my blazer and slacks, suddenly aware that they’ve just stepped from asphalt to wood, crossing the line between my space and Jane’s.

I shouldn’t worry. It’s a Monday and Jane is a teacher. Her husband, David, is a banker. She leaves the house at 6:45 a.m., and he leaves at dawn, no matter the season. Jane used to call this admirable, but I call it obsessive, maybe self-obsessed. Because, honestly, is driving in your climate-controlled Tesla to sit in a plush office of latte-delivering interns that hard? No, it’s not.

What is hard? Dealing with sickly, sticky five-year-olds who poop their pants for attention and guzzle Elmer’s glue like tequila. From what I’ve glimpsed over these three weeks, Jane gets to work before all the other teachers, parking in the farthest spot. In the classroom, she cleans each child’s desk with Lysol, knowing Crayola will soon replace Lemon Breeze. Then she writes a lesson plan on the board, eats two hard-boiled eggs, and sips matcha until her first child arrives.

Betty finds Jane and David’s key and sticks it in the lock, pushing open the heavy mahogany door. The cold air hits us instantly, clings to our skin. I’ve seen pictures of the house, but Zillow doesn’t do it justice: the foyer is massive with sparkling, black-and-white tiles, an ornate staircase that leads to a visible second floor, a crystal chandelier suspended above it all.

I try to appear like I’m considering the space and say, ‘It’ll be small for me, but maybe it’s got a good pool?’

‘No pool,’ Betty says, leading me deeper into the house. The hall seems to stretch forever, like that scene in The Shining. ‘But it has an open floor plan and this nice crown molding throughout. The foundations are from 1901 . . .’

If they don’t have a pool, David must workout at Equinox, but I’ve only seen him there twice – once two Saturdays prior and again last Wednesday after work. When she met him four years ago, Jane told me David would swim laps every day for hours. As we shared a carton of pad thai on our lumpy futon, she explained how he hated the feeling of being sweaty or sticky, of looking to the outside world as if he was exerting any effort. I told her this was a red flag, but she disagreed. She thought that he was ‘so smart’, the way he kept up appearances ‘so impressive’. While the other guys she’d dated couldn’t be bothered to match their socks, clean the pink rings growing in their toilet bowls.

‘What’s the price again?’ I ask Betty, already knowing.

She brings us into the kitchen, a sterile space with white walls and white marble countertops, everything stainless steel, faux aluminium brick flooring, the table and chairs two different shades of grey. ‘It’s listed at 1.5,’ she says, ‘but they’re open to offers. Only been here seven months.’ Then she points to the double dishwashers. ‘See those?’

I nod as if my third-floor walk-up – the one I shared with Jane – has one let alone two. ‘Huh, I’d expected higher. You see, my late husband, Richard –’ I let out a small sigh. ‘Forgive me. The life insurance policy he left was, let’s call it, extraordinarily fair.’

‘I’m sorry to hear that.’ Betty sticks out her lower lip, pouting. But it’s only for half a second, then she’s turning toward the sink, earnestly explaining about the ‘high-end’ garbage disposal, and now my fake, dead husband is really dead. She flicks on the disposal, and we listen to it consume whatever Jane and David had for dinner. Chicken, I think, probably dry. Jane isn’t a good cook. I cooked for us, starting from the day we met.

I’d moved to our dreary Detroit suburb for sixth grade and, after a month, still hadn’t made friends, which shouldn’t be surprising since I was a twelve-year-old girl with a buzz cut. In my last school, a military school, the boys copied their fathers, and no one minded when I copied the boys (even though I didn’t have a father and my mother, a Lieutenant Colonel, had bushy, brown hair). In Detroit, everyone asked if I had cancer. When I said no, they stayed far away.

My mother was rarely home, so if someone knocked on our door, I usually didn’t answer. But one day I did, and there was Jane, blonde hair in two braids, summer freckles dusting her nose and cheeks. Her left hand was in her pocket, her right stuck out for me to shake. ‘I’m your neighbor,’ she said. ‘Cool hair. Mind if I hang out here?’ But she was already walking past me.

I made us a box of Kraft Mac & Cheese, and we watched the newest episode of Hannah Montana. ‘The Best of Both Worlds’ hummed in the background as Jane scrutinized my head. ‘Are you sure you don’t have cancer?’

I rubbed my stubble. ‘Yep, pretty sure.’ A beat passed between us as I shifted on the leather couch. ‘Why’d you come over?’

She seemed unsure for a moment and chewed at her top lip. ‘My parents are fighting. They’ll get over it, but the screaming, it kind of hurts my ears.’

I nodded like I knew.

The next day, Jane returned; they were yelling again. She came three nights later, then two nights after that, and soon we devised a system so that I would have the Kraft and the DVR ready. Jane’s mother loved flowers, but her father was allergic, so they had fake plants around the house, mostly plastic tulips. One white tulip on a vase in the kitchen windowsill facing ours meant Jane was alone, everything was good. Yellow meant her parents were coexisting. Pink was DEFCON 1. When she left a pink tulip, I started boiling the water.

Jane never mentioned my cancer again. Instead, when a girl from class asked how my chemo was going, Jane gave her crooked bangs. When, in eighth grade, I was passed over for the lead in The Wizard of Oz, Jane had us TP the director’s house and then film our own version in which I was Dorothy, she the scarecrow, tin man, and lion. When no one asked me to junior prom, she turned down three proposals and bought us matching corsages. When, at eighteen, I slept alone several nights a week – Mom’s work increasingly demanding travel – Jane practically moved in. She said she never wanted me to feel lonely.

For seven years, she left tulips on her kitchen windowsill each night. For seven years, I was ready to receive ‘DEFCON Pink,’ as we came to call it. I was ready with macaroni, Disney, oblivion: a blank space to relieve the voices she was escaping from. Because in that empty house, Jane became my sound, and I became her silence.

The kitchen opens into the living room: an Ikea-style coffee table, a heavy, peach carpet, an off-white sofa covered in protective plastic wrap. There’s a vase of flowers on the table, but they’re lilies, not tulips, and they’re purple, which never meant anything. Scuffmarks litter the wood, and rings from cold drinks tattoo its edges despite a neat pile of coasters there in the center.

I scan the room, desperate for anything to indicate Jane misses me. I run my fingers along the sofa’s plastic; the cushions look like they’re being suffocated. Betty assures it’s only for tours and don’t worry there’s no critters here. ‘Take a seat,’ she says. ‘Kick your feet up.’

But when I try and sit, I’m repelled back. I squirm and the plastic crinkles. I put one foot on the table, then the other, getting comfortable, which makes Betty gasp a little and I realize, too late, that she wasn’t serious. ‘Maybe we should move to the bedrooms,’ she says. But it’s hard to notice or care because there’s a 75-inch flatscreen in front of me and not a painting in sight.

Jane first became passionate about art, specifically Renaissance art, during our freshman year at NYU. I was an actor, convinced I would make it to Broadway, devoting all my time to rehearsal. But the longer Jane spent in the art department, the less we were together. I asked her to volunteer on the crew, as an usher. She had no interest. She still came to every show, still cyberbullied any publication that gave me a bad review. By that point, I was used to capitulating to her. So I gave in: I double majored in art history.

After graduation, Jane got a job working HR at Christie’s, while I did small roles off-Broadway. She’d claim she wanted to get her master’s, to be a professor of art. Yet every year the deadlines came and went until, finally, I applied with her. I was accepted at Columbia, Fordham, Brooklyn College, and the New School. Jane got into Fordham. When I put down my deposit, she said she was just waiting for her next pay check.

But between pay checks, Jane met David at a dimly lit bar near our apartment. She liked to go there and drink Moscato and read, mostly Woolf, Plath, and Dickinson. Only depressing, dead women who’d been institutionalized, Jane said, or should have been. She thought it was romantic, sipping cheap white wine on a Tuesday, filling her brain with haunting, feminine worlds.

That night, as Jane told it, David sat on the wooden stool beside hers and cracked open a copy of Infinite Jest. She noted this and cleared her throat, slightly arched her back. When he turned, though, he stared into her eyes, not at her chest. After several drinks, she knew she’d met her husband; he was almost too handsome, too perfect.

Within six months, Jane and David were engaged. And then there was a wedding to plan, and our apartment became a flurry of sample invitations on heavy paper, stacks of wedding dress catalogs, doll-like squares of chocolate cake and red velvet cake and carrot cake. And suddenly the Renaissance was out, and bar napkins, flower arrangements, and thin, champagne-colored, paper straws were in. Graduate courses were too much work, Jane said, plus David made a lot of money. I went to Fordham alone.

‘What about our deal?’ I asked Jane as we bubble-wrapped kitchenware the week before her move.

I reminded her of the vow we exchanged in the girl’s third-floor bathroom during homecoming our senior year of high school. The DJ’s bass thumping through tiled walls, the putrid smell of puke mixing with hairspray like toxic sludge, me dabbing lines of mascara on her cheeks while she cursed Tommy Allen for kissing another girl on the dance floor. We swore never to trust men, never to get married. We swore we’d be each other’s family, forever.

‘We were just girls,’ Jane said. ‘We were just saying things.’

‘But what about me?’ I asked.

‘What about you?’

‘I’ll be alone.’

Jane picked up a rusted wine opener and considered it thoughtfully. ‘Have you tried Hinge?’

‘I’m serious. What’s going to happen to us?’

‘Seriously, you’re my best friend. Nothing’s going to happen to us.’

I remember feeling assured by her crooked smile. Like I was silly for thinking otherwise, like I was crazy for imagining she might slip away.

So tell me why it’s been a year since Jane and I last spoke. Tell me if I’m crazy.

Back in the foyer, Betty and I study the open walk-in closet. Jane and David’s coats hang limp in the murky space, like skins waiting to be inhabited. ‘There’s eight closets total,’ Betty says proudly, nodding at the sparsely filled rack. Then she closes the door and proceeds to the stairs, brushing past a skinny entryway console filled with takeout menus, junk mail, and two framed pictures: one of Jane and David in front of the London Eye, another at the top of Machu Picchu, their arms raised.

‘And how many bedrooms?’ I ask. The answer is four. I grip the staircase’s metal banister with one hand and lean back a little, testing its weight, feeling like Gene Kelly.

‘Four plus an office connected to the master,’ she says, kitten heels clapping on the stairs. ‘They meant to make it a nursery.’

‘Are they pregnant?’ I ask, swinging back and forth, staring at Jane’s sweaty face in front of the ancient Incan city. Her lululemon leggings and zip-up. I couldn’t even get her to run.

‘I think they’re trying,’ Betty says as she reaches the top landing. When she turns and finds I’m still there at the bottom, she gets this impatient or maybe concerned look on her face. It makes my stomach knot, the tension, the need to unravel it. Our height difference is funny, I think, like she’s Queen Elizabeth and I’m her peasant, and so I pretend to do the royal wave, cupping my palm and toggling it left then right, left then right.

Betty only clears her throat.

I drop my hand and take the stairs two at a time. When we’re facing each other, me huffing from the climb, I point at her stomach and have another go: ‘I see you tried too.’ At this, Betty’s face goes red, and she waddles off.

Two weeks after their honeymoon at the Ritz-Carlton Reserve in Dorado Beach, Jane told me she and David were ‘trying’, which meant she’d officially given up on Fordham, officially abandoned our pact. Still, I kept my mouth shut. I bought her birthing books, a basal body thermometer to track ovulation, unnaturally tiny hats in yellow and green. I sent her articles on diet and male fertility, lists of the leafy greens and legumes David should eat to give them a baby with a high IQ.

But it didn’t matter because Jane and David tried to no avail: no pink line, no smiley face on the pee-stained stick. They tried with the help of doctors, holistic nutritionists and, once, a hypnotist. They tried in their Brooklyn apartment, in a London hotel room, in a tree house at their third spa retreat, and in David’s Times Square office, watching as the New Year’s Eve ball dropped. They tried for six months, eight months, a year.

At the start, I called Jane every day. She picked up right after sometimes, still panting as she described the positions they’d tried in, what was scientifically better for the gamete to reach the oviduct and link up with an oocyte. I felt more connected to her than at any time in our adult lives, but especially in the months since she’d moved. I figured that this baby would be my bridge. She’d ask me to nanny. She’d ask me to be godmother. I’d become a part of rather than outside of the family she was growing.

Then, after several months, Jane stopped answering every day. She answered every other day. Once a week. Every two weeks. She was probably embarrassed, upset. So I texted too. I DM’d, Snapchatted, and Facebook messaged. I used LinkedIn once. No, twice.

After a particularly long stretch of silence, we met for lunch, Jane’s idea. She brought David, which wasn’t unexpected. I hadn’t seen her alone since the wedding. For twenty minutes, he talked about hedge ratios, derivative securities, and busted convertibles, which has nothing to do with cars, and I sipped my wine and smiled and nodded when Jane did.

When he eventually went to the bathroom, I leaned across the table. ‘You understand this stuff?’

‘No, but he gets so excited,’ Jane said, breaking her bread in two and mashing it against her olive oil-drenched plate. ‘I bought one of those For Dummies books.’ She popped the bread into her mouth and wiped her fingers on the tablecloth.

‘You aren’t bored?’

‘I think it’s sweet. It reminds me of you and those shows. All the jargon.’

I laughed uncomfortably, thought back on how she listened to me describe the merits of method acting, the differences in stage lighting, how I believe ‘break a leg’ is an insult.

‘The real reason for this lunch,’ she said, looking toward the bathroom, ‘is I wanted to tell you to cool it. On the texts? The calls? I know you’re excited about . . .’ She gripped her stomach. ‘Our trying, but I need some space, some time away.’

I concentrated on the oil coating her lips. I wanted to reach out and rub it off. Instead, I slid my hands under my butt. ‘Time away from me?’

‘Yes,’ she said, staring intently at the oil pool. ‘Yes.’

I limited myself to one call a week, to texting every two days. It was like a diet, a Jane diet. It was the newness of space, the extra air that I found most affecting. Without her, everything felt emptier, as if she’d vacuumed up the corners of my life. The reality was I didn’t have many friends: they were Jane’s friends. I didn’t have places I liked to go or things I liked to do. They were her places, her things.

Admittedly, I broke my diet often, calling and texting when I shouldn’t have. Because, sometimes, she did reply, with a word or two. But then, later, even these monosyllables dried up. I was sending text messages that never delivered, writing emails that bounced back, just to feel close to her. I kept up with her fertility journey online until I couldn’t find her profiles. I made new accounts to test if it was a problem with my phone, but she’d disappear again. I filed reports with Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook and never heard back.

After two years, I’d been through three Craigslist roommates while Jane and David were pregnant zero times. I tried to throw myself into work, but I felt my concentration melting away, my worries about gallery openings and exhibits becoming worries about Jane. What was she doing? People used to say I was precise, exact, obsessively committed. I was.

I mailed a lengthy letter to Jane and David’s address and, finally, got my response. It was a text that said a lot of things, some nicer than others, but mostly that Jane was cutting me off.

She said David might pursue legal action if I continued to contact them, to show up where I wasn’t invited. Her last line: please, stop.

Betty moves with her stomach pushed out, and it reminds me of a toddler learning to walk, bumbling around as if on stilts. I follow as she wobbles into the master bedroom: a king-size bed, two matching bedside tables, a second 75-inch mounted on the wall, a door, barely ajar, to a smaller room with a cream-colored rocking chair and several unopened boxes. Through the wilting cardboard handles, I see something fluffy and brown.

‘So,’ I say, picking up a thick book on, I assume, David’s side. ‘Do you know why they’re selling?’

Betty eyes me and laughs in clumsy breathes. ‘I, uh, promise it’s nothing wrong with the house.’ She enters the en suite bathroom, motioning for me to follow. ‘They’re moving to Iowa, I think.’ Everything is blinding white tiles and light wood. ‘Or maybe it’s Indiana? The husband’s got some big new job.’ Three digital panels manage at least four temperature gauges. Betty leans against one, her elbow pressed on the upwards arrow until the screen says 86 degrees and my feet begin to burn. ‘Nice guy, the husband. Now how about this rain shower?’

It was always about David. When Jane and I still talked, David was the reason we couldn’t hang out. David has a work event. David’s too tired. David thinks we should take it easy tonight. David had invaded our lives so completely he was like that alien who impregnates one of the crew, bursts out of the guy’s chest, and takes over the spaceship.

David had taken over our ship.

After that text, when Jane’s silence became prolonged, profound, inescapable, this idea about him solidified, convincing me to show up outside their sprawling, three-bedroom in Williamsburg. I remember the Ring camera leering above the bell, pressing that thick, black button, Jane opening the door in a fuchsia robe, blonde hair piled in a messy bun. Her makeup was done, but she looked bloated, heavy.

‘What are you doing here?’ She turned to search behind her shoulder.

‘I’m glad you’re alive,’ I replied, reaching for her cheek.

She pushed the hand away as David appeared. He was a tall, gangly man. Jane would say he was kind, intelligent, funny, but I couldn’t see it, the personality she claimed he had. He was always overly polite, always enunciated words. He liked Catan and pickleball. He believed in the efficacy of blue light glasses, thought crypto was the future and running was passé. Didn’t that just make him Elon Musk?

‘Nice to see you,’ he said stiffly, squeezing Jane’s arm. When he leaned down to whisper in her ear, I saw she became uncomfortable, shifting from foot to foot. It was in that moment I realized: David knew what I’d said about him. Now he was whispering in her ear that I was the problem, that I was the one who had to go. As Jane glanced between us, a yearning in her eyes, I clocked her pink robe again. Was this is a mayday, a new cipher for DEFCON Pink? I was almost positive she was asking for help.

David pulled back, grimacing as he looked me over, then went inside. When he was gone, I gathered my friend’s hands in mine. ‘You have to believe,’ I said, ‘nothing he says about me is true.’

Jane began crying, hysterical and snot-filled sobs. I wanted so badly to reach out to her, to hold her, but she said, ‘I need you to seek help, like real help. You’re not right, you know? I’ve been trying to say it nicely.’

My vision turned blurry. ‘You tried to say what nicely?’

‘That I can’t breathe.’ She inhaled dramatically, rubbed her cheeks. Then she glared at me and twisted her mouth into this hard, mean line I’d never seen before. ‘If you come back, I’ll call the cops. I’m sorry, I’m sorry,’ she repeated as she closed the door in my face. The reclaimed wood hit my nose.

I tried to do what Jane said, ‘seek help.’ I got a therapist – actually, a team of them. One for alternating days of the week because I was that serious. I told each therapist what happened, and they all came back with an alphabet soup of scientific diagnoses, but it really boiled down to one: stalking. I was, apparently, ‘stalking’ Jane. Two psychiatrists wrote prescriptions I didn’t fill, and the others asked me to talk, which I preferred. I talked about my childhood, my lack of family and friends, my failing PR business, my failed dreams. It didn’t matter. When they repeated that word, ‘stalking’, it didn’t click. Because you can’t stalk your best friend. You can’t stalk the person you lived with for ten years, the person who held you when your mom died, the person who woke you up because she was afraid to fall asleep alone, because the blaring ambulances and the honking horns reminded her of her parents’ raised voices.

Months later, when I ghosted the last therapist, I returned to Williamsburg. But Jane’s landlord said they’d moved. To the suburbs, he thought. I knew the office where David worked. And so, one day, I decided to rent the Ford Escape, to tail David’s Tesla up Broadway and onto the highway, across the GW Bridge, home to New Jersey.

I was going to wait and watch until I found something to prove that I wasn’t crazy, that Jane needed me.

As Betty points out the bathtub’s multiple jacuzzi settings, I think about what I’ll say to Jane when I bump into her at the grocery store – the one she visits twice a week – or the park where she goes jogging. I’ll tell her to come home, that she can sneak out like she used to. That he can’t keep us apart any longer. Maybe I’ll leave a Polaroid of us on her bedside table, a folded-up note in her La Mer night cream, just so she knows I’m close. I wonder if they have tulips in the backyard. I’ll put one on the kitchen windowsill. I’ll activate DEFCON Pink, remind her that we took care of one another, remind her that she’s living the life we vowed to avoid. Jane called these people sad, the ones who walk around eating, drinking, working, fucking on a schedule. But here she is, rising at six o’clock, driving to school, leaving school, going to the grocery store, buying corn flakes and sliced ham, driving home. No art or culture, no urban sounds or rural silence. The suburb exists somewhere in the middle, I think, like purgatory.

There’s only one deviation I’ve noticed in Jane’s routine. The last three Fridays, she and David have gone to a fertility center during lunch. It’s never been the same office, but Jane will always come out sniffling, and David will always hold her tightly, tenderly. If I use the binoculars I store in my Ford, I can see that he’ll shed a tear too, saying something to conjure a glimmer of hope in her eyes. They’ll embrace and he’ll whisper in her ear. She’ll shudder and fall deeper into his arms.

In the master bedroom, Betty flags another gaudy crystal chandelier, and I have to cover my mouth to keep from laughing. I can tell she’s looking at me funny when she says, ‘What do you think?’

‘It’s perfect. Thank you . . . for all the information.’

Her eye twitches, and there’s a beat of uneasy silence. So I smile, at her face and then at her stomach. ‘When are you due?’

‘Oh,’ she says and squints at her belly, ‘I’m not –’

Just then, there’s a dinging sound indicating the front door has opened. It paralyzes us, traps us like ants in glue. We listen to it ring, inspecting each other over the quilted sheets until finally Betty says, ‘I didn’t think anyone would be here.’ She shuffles eagerly to the doorframe and pops her head out. ‘We’re upstairs, down in a minute!’

‘They’re home?’ I feel a hand going to my chest.

The realtor surveys me again, smiles with one corner of her mouth. ‘Maybe they wanted to meet their prospective buyer?’

I nod. I try to as I follow her out of the room. But I’m more focused on how hard my heart is beating.

Betty starts down the stairs, holding her empty stomach with one hand and the banister with the other. I pause at the top, scanning for an open window. I can see Jane and David below hanging up their light jackets. Jane looks so beautiful and so sad, dressed in a pink wrap dress. She’s wiping tears and David’s rubbing her back, his fingers tangled in her hair.

‘We’ll try again,’ I hear him say, his voice echoing, reaching every crown-molded corner of the room. ‘We’ll try again.’

This isn’t right. This isn’t how it’s supposed to happen.

‘Hello there,’ Betty says as she reaches them, unable to read their private moment.

It’s not even Friday. It’s Monday.

They turn and face her, and me, just as I’ve descended the first step.

Jane stiffens. ‘Emma?’

David’s mouth hangs open.

Betty glances between the three of us, smile faltering. ‘This is, uh, Jessica Tandy,’ she says, gesturing up at me. ‘The woman I told you about, Jane.’

Jane’s eyes are wide. ‘Grab your phone,’ she whispers to David.

David’s hands are still enmeshed in her hair, like a marionettist fumbling with the strings.

Betty Lane is twirling her necklace, its metal chain cutting off her circulation in real time.

‘The police,’ Jane says, frowning at David, eyes breaking from mine. ‘Mention the restraining order.’

David isn’t moving, and it’s upsetting Jane. I want to make her laugh, so I say, ‘Tell them it’s DEFCON Pink.’ Then I lift my hand and give them the royal wave.

    "text": "Ihave to write about her before I begin to forget her. Because I’ll have to forget her if I want to resume my old peaceful life.

Because that’s what I’d really like to do: live in peace, without fear or memory. It’s enough for me to run my household as I did before, to care for the children and look out of the window into the garden. If one behaves calmly, I thought, one cannot get involved in other people’s business. And I thought of Wolfgang. It was so nice having him around me every day. Should I have endangered our peaceful companionship over Stella?

No, things couldn’t have ended worse for me if I had. Stella is avenging herself on me, and taking from me the only thing to which my heart still clings. But that’s nonsense. Stella can’t take her revenge, she was already so helpless when she was alive, how helpless she must be now. I am taking Stella’s revenge on myself, that’s the truth, and it’s as it should be, however much I might try to resist.

Of course I’ve always known that the day would come, it didn’t need Stella for that to happen. Sooner or later Wolfgang would have been lost to me. He’s one of those people who has no illusions and accepts the consequences. I don’t have any illusions either, but I live as if I did. I used to think I could start over again from the beginning, but it’s much too late for that now, in fact it was always too late for that, except I didn’t want to acknowledge it.

There could no longer be any point in anything, because Wolfgang moved away from me. And that’s good for him.

I read somewhere that you can get used to anything, and habit is the strongest force in our lives. I don’t believe it. It’s only the excuse that we need to keep from thinking about the suffering of our fellow human beings, or indeed about our own suffering. It’s only the excuse that we need to stop thinking about our own suffering. It’s true, a human being can endure a lot, not only out of habit, but because a faint spark glimmers within them, which they secretly hope will one day allow them to break the habit. The fact that they usually can’t, out of weakness and cowardice, does not speak against it. Or are there perhaps two kinds of people, those who get used to things and those who aren’t able to? I can’t believe that; it’s probably just a matter of constitution. Once we reach a certain age, we are gripped by anxiety and try to fight against it in some way. We sense that we’re in a hopeless position, and make desperate little attempts to escape.

If the first of these attempts is unsuccessful, as it generally is, we surrender until the next one, which will already be weaker, and which will leave us feeling still more miserable and defeated.

So Richard regularly drinks his red wine, chases after women and money, my friend Luise pursues men who are young enough to be her son, and I stand at the window and stare into the garden. Stella, that stupid young person, escaped successfully on her first attempt.

I would much prefer it if I could switch places with her, if I didn’t have to sit here and write her pitiful story, which is also my pitiful story. I would much prefer to be dead like her, and not have to hear the little bird crying. Why does no one protect me against its cry, against dead Stella and the agonising red of the tulips on the chest of drawers? I don’t like red flowers.

My colour is blue. It gives me courage, and detaches everyone and everything from me. Richard thinks I only wear my blue clothes because they suit my face; he doesn’t know that I wear them for protection. No one can hurt me when I’m wearing them. The blue keeps everything far away from me. Stella loved red and yellow, and it was in the red dress I gave her that she ran in front of a yellow-painted truck.

That radiantly yellow death that hurtled towards her like a sun, I think it was beautiful and terrible like the death we know from the ancient legends.

I had to identify her. Her face was unharmed, but greenish-white and much smaller than it had seemed to me when she was alive. The disturbed and half-deranged expression of the last few days had fled from it, making way for an icy silence.

Stella had always been a little clumsy and shy, and even when she was cheerful, her regular, wide face was immobile. Then it blossomed from within to her lips. Stella had been very happy for a short time, but she was unable to learn the rules of the game, she couldn’t adapt and she had to perish.

A frivolous and greedy mother had stuck her in a boarding school as a child. I remember observing her then, about five years ago, in church. She knelt beside me, her face turned towards the monstrance, her eyes wide open, her lips arched slightly forwards, open and devoted. And with the same expression she later stared at the evening paper behind which Richard’s face was hidden. Wolfgang saw it too. He blushed and grew pale, and finally he choked on something to distract my attention from Stella. At fifteen he knew just as well as I did what was happening in front of our eyes, and he was trying desperately to protect me from that knowledge, while my sole concern was keeping him out of the game, and so I did exactly what I shouldn’t have done, namely nothing.

While Stella, unable to conceal her single big emotion, slipped inexorably into her disaster and Richard tried to deceive us with his smooth bonhomie, I made an effort to remain oblivious to everything. For Wolfgang’s sake and also for mine, because there’s nothing I hate more than scenes and arguments, and even a tense atmosphere is enough to leave me disturbed and uneasy for weeks.

The loneliness and peace of my room, the view of the garden, the tenderness that filled me at the sight of Wolfgang, was I supposed to put everything – and for me it is everything – at risk for the sake of a girl who ran dully and inexorably into her fate, condemned from the very beginning to be broken, with her simple, foolish emotion, by our disintegrating, divided world?

Well, it wasn’t worth my trouble, but it should have been, because Stella’s was the young life that I allowed to run headlong into a murderous, metal machine.

One can perish in very different ways, out of stupidity just as easily as out of an excess of caution; the former seems more worthy to me, but it is not my way.

Luise, Stella’s mother, didn’t come until after the funeral. She’d been travelling, and nobody from her little provincial town knew where she had gone. By the time we were finally able to contact her it was all over. Richard had sorted it all out, well and appropriately, as he tends to sort everything out. Luise, and incidentally she had been with her boyfriend, a young postgrad student, in Italy, now sat facing us in our sitting room, sobbing.

Richard gave her platitudes, which sound more convincing from his lips than from mine, words of genuine sympathy. His eyes were deep blue and moist, as they are when he is agitated or drunk, and I couldn’t help thinking of the wreaths on the bare hill. There weren’t many wreaths, by the way, because in this town Stella had only us and a few friends from school. I thought of the hill and of Stella’s body, bled dry and crushed, in its wooden prison. For the first time I was filled with pity. It was foolish and absurd, because Stella was dead, and yet pity swelled within me like a physical pain that sat like a lump in my chest and radiated all the way to my fingers. And yet that pain was no longer meant for Stella, but for her dead body, which was now doomed to decay.

I heard Richard talking, but didn’t understand any of what he was saying. Gripped with horror, I only saw his eyes, which were so moist and alive. Every hair of him was alive, his skin, his breath, his hands, and the sight of it took my breath away.

Seen from outside, we were a middle-aged couple trying to comfort a mother who was bent with pain. Except Luise is not a mother bent with pain. Stella’s death was very timely for her. We knew that, and she knew we knew, but she sobbed and wept as her role demanded.

Now that Stella’s legacy, the pharmacy, has come to her, Luise can marry her postgrad, who would never have taken her without the dowry. She can buy this strong young man and persuade herself for a while that she was lucky.

Stella had become a burden to us all, an obstacle that had finally been cleared out of the way. Of course it would have been even better if she’d had a happy marriage, emigrated, or otherwise somehow disappeared from our field of vision. But she had disappeared at any rate, and we were able to forget her for once and for all.

I could tell by looking at Richard just how much he’d forgotten her already, since for him forgetting is a physical thing. His body has already forgotten Stella; tall, broad, and hungry for new women and new sensations, he sat next to me and patted Luise’s thin bird fingers with his broad well-tended hand, which is always dry, warm, and pleasant to the touch.

And Luise’s whimpering fell silent under that warmth, under the sound of his calming voice.

‘I always told her,’ she groaned, ‘pay attention when you’re crossing the road. I would just like to know what she was thinking of.’

‘Yes,’ Richard said sorrowfully, ‘we would like to know that too, wouldn’t we, Anna?’

He looked at me and I nodded. There wasn’t even a hint of irony in his voice. I apologised and said that I needed to check on the kitchen. I didn’t go into the kitchen, however, but into the bathroom and started putting on a bit of rouge. Pallor doesn’t suit me.

Stella had been pale in the last few weeks too, but she was nineteen, and suffering refined her face, making it more adult and charming. A woman over thirty needs to be able to stop suffering, it doesn’t do anything good to her appearance by then.

When Stella came to us, her skin was slightly tanned. She was beautiful, but lacking in charm and grace. She was a bit too healthy and strong for modern tastes. Indeed, it later took a heavy truck to crush the life out of her body. It was so considerate of Stella to make the whole thing look like an accident. And it showed how little Luise had known her daughter that she believed she had stepped off the curb unintentionally. Because Stella’s dreaminess was that of a sleepy, strong, young animal finding its way through the bustle of the city as if in a trance. Not even the driver of the truck, a simple, ignorant young man, believed it was an accident. Stella wanted to die, and with the same unreflective self-abandonment with which she had once dropped into life, she fell out of the same life that had neglected to hold on to her with a bit of love, kindness, and patience. We have cause for gratitude. How embarrassing it would have been had she taken sleeping pills or thrown herself out of a window. Her elegance, which was an elegance of the heart, showed itself in the manner of her death, giving us all the opportunity to believe in a meaningless accident.

But what use is all of this if the only person who should really have believed it does not believe it and never will. Stella will always stand between me and Wolfgang. The time of childish tenderness and trust has passed. Wolfgang abhors his father and despises me for my cowardice. He will only understand me much later, when he goes from one room to the other as I do, alone with my unease and the knowledge that the prison is completely inescapable. But by then I will have ceased to be, just as my father has ceased to be, whose ironic laissez-faire attitude filled me with insecurity as a child. The eye that fell upon me when I played with my dolls is the eye with which I follow Wolfgang when he goes to play tennis with his friend, and with which he already observes his little sister’s games.

If Wolfgang were with me now, he would try to save the bird in the linden tree, and I would need to deter him, because if the mother bird doesn’t return the little one will be beyond help, it can’t eat on its own. Only its mother could save it, and I’m starting to doubt that she’s coming back. It has grown smaller than it was, I’m sure of it, even though it was already so tiny in the morning that I couldn’t imagine a smaller bird. I can see it clearly now, a little bundle of feathers opening its beak and its eyes wide with fear and hunger. Its mother isn’t going to come. I’ve closed the window again. The sun is shining on the little bird now. Maybe it will go to sleep and I’ll have a few hours of peace if I know it’s safe. All this crying is draining its strength away far too soon. Perhaps it’s thirsty, in fact it must be. But how ridiculous to be bothered by a bird. Richard would laugh at me. I just have to believe that its mother will find it. Sometimes I find myself thinking that it’s my inability to believe that attracts calamity. Perhaps Richard would never have become the person he is today if I had blindly believed him, perhaps everything would have been different if my father had not looked at us so strangely the day I brought Richard home. How could he have known, who gave him the right to know what was to come, and who gives me the right to pursue Wolfgang with my eyes just as I pursued Richard and Stella?

We need to get used to looking past people and things, we should never allow our thoughts to deceive us. It would be even better, of course, if we could stop thinking, because even our thoughts kill.

I thought: ‘He will destroy Stella.’ I thought it for long enough for it to happen in reality. I know that Richard is afraid of my thoughts. Superstitious, like everyone with an energetic constitution, he fears only what he cannot grasp and understand for himself. But he is strong enough to push that fear aside, as he pushes aside everything that would get in the way of his plans.

Why did nothing warn me on that September evening, when Stella came to us? Why didn’t I simply turn down Luise’s request? It didn’t suit me at all to take this strange young woman into our home, and even Richard wasn’t exactly thrilled with the idea. He only agreed for my sake and because Stella was only supposed to stay for ten months. Luise is my friend, that is to say she has claimed to be my friend for thirty years. I’ve never liked her, not even at school, because even as a child she was stingy, duplicitous, and hateful. Luise always wanted to have my things, in those early days she stole my erasers, patent leather belts, and sausage sandwiches, later she wanted the men who wooed me, and now at last, with the help of her daughter, she has destroyed the peace I’d struggled so hard to find. She is a bringer of misfortune, Luise, ugly, dried-up, and boy crazy. But I’ve never managed to persuade Richard that she’s just a burden to me. He simply doesn’t understand that there are some people you despise and still cannot escape. Never in his life would Richard have found himself in such a situation. He shrugs off everyone who isn’t of use to him in some way or other. Even Stella wasn’t much use to him for long; a few weeks, nothing more. She made him far too uncomfortable. What could a seducer like him do with this clumsy, earnest child? No woman has ever bored him as quickly as Stella did.

Richard had never seen her before. Luise always tended to travel without her daughter, and he had formed a quite mistaken impression of Stella. Even today I can’t believe that Stella was really Luise’s daughter, even though there can be no doubt about it. Stella’s father must have been an irresponsible fellow if he managed to spawn a child with Luise. He seems to have immediately regretted this development and tried, by drawing up a will that was as refined as it was shortsighted, to protect his child from his wife by making Luise the beneficiary of his financial assets while Stella would inherit the pharmacy. But he really shouldn’t have arranged his will like this, because as a result he created an implacable enemy for his daughter. The best thing that Luise ever did for Stella was to put the child – who was often terrified, crouched in a corner at home, becoming more and more of a hindrance – in a convent. There, Stella found so much love that she was able to store it up and live off it for eight years. Of course she really should have studied pharmacy, but that training was not what Luise had in mind – the less Stella understood of what she was supposed to understand, the better it was for Luise. But since Stella had to do something, in the end, and her mother had no use for her whatsoever alongside her women friends, dogs, and lovers, she hit upon the idea of foisting Stella off on me, at least for a year, or as long as her business studies course lasted. In quiet despair, Luise must’ve said to herself that the day of Stella’s maturity was drawing ever closer. That wouldn’t have been her downfall, of course, because she still had a legacy, and she had certainly become rich enough over the past few years, barely hampered by an old and half-demented guardian. But then again there was also the matter of this young man whom she was determined to marry, but whom, as she was probably well aware, she could only buy. It was a hopeless situation for her, I admit.

So Stella came to us, pushed aside once again by her mother, and also not eagerly awaited by us.

Our household, in fact, is set up in such a way that it cannot withstand an intruder, or even a guest. For reasons that are only too obvious. Richard’s friends will never be my friends, and Richard finds my friends uncongenial. Apart from this, no one else is familiar with the countless taboos that we must observe in our dealings with one another, and which must be respected even by the children. Consequently, our topics of conversation are somewhat restricted, but of course that’s better than ceaseless friction. Then there’s also the fact that a stranger would destroy my relationship with Wolfgang: everyone disturbed the two of us in those days, even little Annette, and of course Richard too. For that reason I didn’t take on a maid as such, but a cleaner, a morose and sulky person who has no interest in us, we are nothing more to her than the people whose floors she cleans in return for a decent wage. She simply does her work, entirely governed by ideas and worries about people that we don’t know or care to meet. People on the moon couldn’t be any stranger than we are to her. Even though it’s never mentioned, there were two sides in our house: Richard and Annette, Wolfgang and me – and we adhered strictly to the rules of the game. Richard had brief and slightly too cordial conversations with his son, to which Wolfgang responded with perfect politeness, and Annette would sometimes sit on my lap, and of course I put her to bed and she would kiss and hug me. But that isn’t entirely true. I think Wolfgang has always loved his father, even though he sees straight through him, and if there is a secret pain in Richard’s life, its name is Wolfgang. His son’s otherness must cause him suffering, if Richard allows himself to suffer, because in fact Richard is seeking a friend, and Wolfgang will never be his friend. Where little Annette is concerned, I would probably love her instinctively if she weren’t so much like her father. It isn’t her fault that the very sight of her sometimes fills me with horror. I see her blossoming little face, I feel her warmth and hear her laughter, and know that they mean just as little as Richard’s warmth and laughter. Both of them, Annette and her father, are born decoys, traps that God, or whoever, has set for other people, the heavy, loyal, imaginative, and emotional ones. Perhaps Annette is also too healthy and happy to be truly loved. This child will always achieve what she wishes for, and will never wish for anything unattainable. She is just as weak and helpless as a young tiger or a carnivorous plant. Richard is proud of this daughter, but basically he knows exactly who she is: a good-natured companion as long as he indulges all her moods.

But since he has never loved anything as much as himself, he must also love this little image of himself. Sometimes he gives Annette a mighty slap, which she takes with a quiet whimper. He has never struck Wolfgang, who is one of those children that one doesn’t strike. Richard is much too clever to show weakness and put himself in the wrong.

During her first weeks with us, Stella was a terrible bother to all of us. Richard, who loved drinking his red wine, smoking and reading in the evening, suddenly felt forced to make conversation with a girl like Stella and found it terribly tiring and utterly pointless. Annette was simply jealous, as she is of anyone who lays claim to the interest of those around her. Wolfgang felt disturbed by the change in atmosphere, and I had a sense of being too quiet and not knowing how to deal with young girls. It seemed impossible to guess Stella’s thoughts and respond to them. This tall, pretty, slightly too well-built girl was an alien element in our house, and she must certainly have felt that herself. She was more timid than shy, inhibited by her years of life in the convent, and I thought she must have seemed a little strange there too. She wasn’t at all cute, childish, and silly as young girls tend to be. In fact she looked like a woman who is only still a child by chance. And as quiet as she was, it was impossible to ignore her. The dreadful brown clothes that Luise had bought for her were unbecoming enough, but she could not simply be ignored.

I had tried to adapt the spare room in which Stella was expected to live to the needs of its young new resident, arranging a few knickknacks around the place, the kind that young girls like, and covering the dark furniture with lace doilies. Then, when I actually saw Stella, I wished I could have cleared all those odds and ends away, but by then she had already seen them, which meant that it was no longer possible. So the horses, dogs, and ballerinas stayed on the chest of drawers and looked quite strange beside this tall, earnest girl. I imagine that Stella never really studied. She sat in front of her exercise books and her textbooks and was simply bored. She was bad at maths, and probably the slowest of her class at shorthand. In fact I had no idea if she had any real talents or skills. She was good with animals and plants, she liked doing menial work, and knitted jackets and socks from coarse grey wool for some poor people or other. Then she sent those rather shapeless things to her old convent. Richard liked to tease her about her charity work. Then she would open her wide, white eyelids and laugh quietly and clumsily, like someone who has yet to learn how to laugh. She only knitted them to avoid accusations of laziness, and so that she could spend hours alone with her thoughts.

I knew nothing at all about those thoughts. Sometimes I doubted that she was thinking anything at all, her face was so still. She liked engaging with Annette, and the child finally began to return her affection. At first Wolfgang observed her with a mixture of curiosity, shyness, and prejudice. In that too every inch my son; it would never have occurred to him to approach a stranger. When it became clear to me that I would never be able to have a real relationship with Stella, I began to abandon my efforts and went back to living as I had done before, as if there were no young girl in my spare room. She still disturbed me, but I knew that the disturbance would not last for very long. I was always friendly towards Stella, just as friendly as I am with my cleaner, the mailman, or Wolfgang’s friends from school.

I started yielding to my own thoughts again, walking from one window to another, smoking or with my hands pushed into my sleeves, gazing into the now bare garden. I bought flowers, which became increasingly expensive as the cold season progressed, I dutifully went for walks with Annette, and I talked to Wolfgang about the books that he was constantly devouring, some of which were perhaps unsuitable for him. Of course I also took care of the housework, got annoyed with Annette, who was lazy and slovenly at school, and, as usual, discussed with Richard all sorts of matters relating to the children and the housekeeping. I did everything according to routine; for me reality meant staring into the garden, wandering restlessly around the house, and feeling warmth in my breast at the sight of Wolfgang.

Something had happened to me years ago that left me in a diminished state, an automaton that just gets on with its work, barely suffers, and is only turned back for seconds at a time into the living young woman that it once was. The touching curve of Wolfgang’s neck, the roses in the white vase, a draught billowing the curtains, and all of a sudden I’m aware that I’m still alive. Then there’s the other thing, which fills me with fear, with horror, with the feeling that something’s going to jump out at me at any moment and break down the invisible wall.

I know that can’t happen, but it forces its way into my mind, time after time, staring at me from the faces of strangers in the street, rising in the howl of a dog, filling my nostrils in the butcher’s shop with the stench of blood, and touching me like a cold hand at the sight of Richard’s full, cheerful face.

Something must have happened to me years ago; since then I don’t think I’ve been able to tolerate the idea that, incomprehensibly to my brain and heart, good and evil are one. To be able to endure that knowledge, one would need the vital force of a giant. But giants do not find themselves in this situation; for them, thinking is replaced by a sturdy cudgel. They prefer to live. Thinking people must always give up living, and living people do not need to think. The act of salvation is never performed, because anyone with the strength to carry it out is unaware that they must do it, and the knowing person is incapable of action

Stella was one of the living. More than a person, she was like a big grey cat or a young deciduous tree. She sat at our table, thoughtless and innocent, waiting for fate. Richard would have needed only to reach out a hand to grip her tanned wrist. He didn’t, but he smiled as he cut up the meat on his plate, calmly, relishing each movement.

Richard is a born traitor. Equipped with a body that grants him constant pleasure, he could live contentedly, were he not gifted with a dazzling intelligence. It’s this intelligence that turns the pleasures of his sensual body into crimes. Richard is a monster: a considerate paterfamilias, a valued lawyer, a passionate lover, traitor, liar, and murderer.

I have known all this for years, and if I knew who I could hold responsible for this knowledge, I would kill them. I used to see only guilt in Richard, and I began to hate him. But now I have known for a long time that he is not to blame if I react like this to the fact of his presence. There are so many others like him, the whole world plainly knows and accepts it, and no one puts him on trial. Whose fault is it that I can’t just accept things as they are? I am slowly giving up hope that someone, I don’t know who, will one day take a stand, and even if they did, I wouldn’t know how to respond. My rage went up in smoke long ago; all that remains is the horror that dominates me completely, and that I inhabit, in which I am trapped. It has entered me, it has saturated me, and it accompanies me wherever I go. There is no escape. My worst thought is that even death could not be deadly enough to extinguish it at last.

But horror and the knowledge of the truth that one is not supposed to know belong to the order of everyday life. Yes, I cling to this order, to the regular mealtimes, the work that returns every day, the visits and walks. I love that order, which allows me to live. One day I was struck by the touching equanimity with which Stella wore her clothes, those brown, claret, and purple horrors that were either too big or too small for her, and which testified to Luise’s wickedness. ‘We should buy her decent clothes,’ I said to Richard, ‘and she would be a beauty.’ He glanced up from the newspaper, gave me a surprised look and said, ‘Do you think so?’

I know his weakness for delicate, distinctive women. I went on to praise Stella’s merits. He laughed and rocked his head regretfully back and forth: buying clothes for her was none of our business. In two years, once she was in possession of the pharmacy, she would start dressing decently. ‘Luise,’ I said, ‘is a disgrace.’ Richard raised his shoulders comically, shook himself a little and laughed. Suddenly I had an idea. What if I taught Stella how to dress? I closed my eyes and saw her coming down a flight of stairs in a white dress, smiling with her lips in a Cupid’s bow, her reddish-brown hair shiny and loose, young, beautiful and seductive. I saw Richard’s white, firm hands holding the newspaper, and was filled with a kind of satisfaction that he couldn’t see this beauty, obstructed as it was by his penchant for an artificial, refined prettiness.

Over the following weeks the seamstress came to the house and sewed a few dresses for Stella, out of cheap materials, but in bright colours suitable for a young girl.

The transformation was complete. Stella stood in front of the mirror and saw herself as what she really was for the first time. ‘You’re beautiful, Stella,’ I said, straightening a crease. She didn’t look at me, and spoke seriously into the mirror, ‘I’m beautiful,’ amazed, surprised and finally overwhelmed by the new feeling that my words and her reflection had awoken in her, and then said again, ‘I’m beautiful.’

Now I could actually have triumphed. Luise, the dragon, had been outwitted. It was entirely possible that the newly transformed Stella could bring home a fiancé who would ensure that in the future Stella’s fortune would not be turned into Luise’s clothes, hats, and lovers. But strangely I was unable to rejoice in this idea. Incidentally, I have never been gratified by a triumph, it usually makes me embarrassed, or puts me in a slightly painful state of mourning. Perhaps it’s because my triumph means the defeat of someone else; I transform myself into that other person and suffer on their behalf. Luise, however, was so repulsive to me that I couldn’t summon that feeling for her. What troubled me in my joy was Stella’s face in the mirror, that gleaming face, that young, blossoming flesh, and that gaze devoted entirely to her new brilliance. I felt a creeping unease. Stella was no longer the child that she had been. There was a void in her breast, and it would draw the world towards it. And I didn’t like that. It was not within my power to guide the flow that would fill that void. ‘Stella,’ I said quickly, ‘Stella, shouldn’t you practise your shorthand today?’

She covered her eyes with her hands in a touchingly childlike gesture and turned towards me. Her arms fell to her sides, the gleam in her eyes was extinguished, and she turned towards the door with a sigh. That evening Richard hadn’t noticed that a new Stella was sitting across from him. But Annette noticed it and so did Wolfgang, who gave me a thoughtful, quizzical look.

Stella, in her strawberry-coloured dress, ate hardly anything and stared dreamily into the distance. Fully in command of her healthy young body, she absent-mindedly took little sips of her tea.

The bird is still sitting in the linden tree. It hasn’t stirred from the spot all night. It isn’t screaming any more, just cheeping faintly. If I close the window, I can’t hear it any more. It’s so tiny now that it can barely be called a bird. Its mother hasn’t come, and I don’t think she’s going to.

When I’m alone in the house I’m always aware that this isn’t my house. Sometimes I feel like a lodger here. All that belongs to me is the view of the garden, nothing else. Once I even imagined that I would at least have something I could call a home, but since Stella’s death, the gilded cage has turned into a dungeon. If I’m not mistaken, the garden has even moved further away from the house. It’s moving away from me, slowly, almost imperceptibly, one day it will disappear completely, and I will stare out of the window into the void and think, that’s where the linden tree used to be, and over there the patch of lawn with the viburnum bushes. Perhaps this has something to do with the windows. They are gradually becoming more opaque until they finally obstruct my view.

‘Have it done before the tournament?’ Bob asks me. He’s with four wrinkled men wearing polo shirts with Flying Tigers and a big paw print stitched on the left breast. They’re older than me, but not as much older as I’d like.

‘Yeah. Be finished by next week,’ I say.

The rocket needs WD-40 and a new weight in the nose cone so it’ll spit the ball onto the green without hitching. My boss, Jaz, finally let me buy what I needed. Which cost all of thirty bucks. Which I asked for a year ago.

‘Don’t put extra speed on it,’ Bob says. ‘Last time you all over-greased it.’

Every time we change some little thing on a course, the Flying Tigers notice. They think they’re big shit because they’re retired pilots for United.

‘I don’t do that, Bob.’

‘I know you don’t, but . . .’ He looks over to where Jaz is fixing a door on a batting cage down the hill.

‘This is my course, Bob. You got a problem, talk to me.’

He smiles. ‘That’s the way things are these days. Can’t say anything, or they sue you into next week, huh?’

Jaz is a Black lady who’s not a lady anymore. Never was, if you ask him. When I started here again, I didn’t think much of it. Working construction all my life, most of the females on our sites were like Jaz, though they didn’t call themselves men then.

I nod at Bob to get him to shut up, but now I’m in a bad mood. The rocket’s a sixty-year-old piece of shit and I’m a sixty-year-old piece of shit for having to work here while rich guys putt around me. When Bob walks away, I hurl the paintbrush at the face of the gnome guarding Hole Seven. Jaz comes up from the cages to tell me to go on break.

‘That troll looks like somebody came in his eye,’ Jaz says. ‘You better clean that up before Amway night. They rented out the whole place on Tuesday. Those people are strange. But they’ve got the cash.’

I wipe off as much as I can, but the gnome is winking and the paint is deep in the crease of his eyelid.

 

‘Rick, come in here a minute,’ says Ben Flett, as I’m hauling a bucket of balls up from the return hole.  He’s standing in the doorway of the main building of the Cool Crest Golf and Game Center, a fake Tudor castle. Behind him, arcade games blink and ping. I set the balls on the counter next to the girls who ring people up and follow Ben into his office.

‘You know what I realized?’ He stands behind his desk chair. ‘The two of us know these courses better than anybody on Earth probably. Think of that!’

I think of it. Fifty years I’ve played here, except for stretches in Arizona and Mississippi, after my divorce. Ben and I are the same age, graduated from Truman High the same year. We worked concessions here and ran the go-cart track ‘78 to ‘81. Ben went to Mizzou afterwards and I went down the aisle and to work. It wasn’t that college did so much for Ben though – his father owned this place.

‘Well, some other people have realized it too, Rick. And I’m thinking maybe you should sit the tournament out this year.’

I don’t answer right away. I’m thinking of the tap of my club on the hollow ball, how I can see even the underground parts in my mind, the hidden course nobody else sees.

‘Hey,’ Ben says, putting up his hands. ‘I’ll sit it out too. It’s just that some people don’t feel their victories are real.’

‘They get the money.’

I could’ve guessed it was coming, after last year when Bob came in fourth. The second and third place guys were cool, but Bob was stomping around, glaring at me.

‘Money isn’t all life’s about, Rick.’

‘Is this or else?’ I ask.

Ben sits down in his chair. ‘No. It’s not like that. It’s a favor.’

A favor. Terrible. I miss Ben’s dad sometimes. With him, it was fuckin’ do it or get lost.

‘Have to think about it.’

‘Thanks Rick,’ he says. ‘I knew you’d understand.’

Ben does that thing all bosses do now. They thank you for doing what they asked, before you’ve agreed to it.

 

‘That’s fucked up,’ Jaz says, when I tell him. He’s bent over a stalled go-cart. He says it like I told him somebody shot up a school in California. Like it’s too bad but doesn’t have much to do with him.

‘You playing?’ I ask.

‘Maybe.’

Jaz is a good player. Sometimes I think we should go to the Hawaiian Rumble in Myrtle Beach and kick ass. Not that he’d want to go with me.

‘You could tell Ben it’s not fair, asking me,’ I say.

‘Whyn’t you tell him no? You said he’s not gonna fire you over it.’

‘Maybe. Maybe not.’

I’ve been fired plenty of times, but this is different. I’ve come back around to where I started and if I don’t keep this loop closed, I feel like I might spin out into the universe and die. Jaz is too young to understand that. Not that I’d tell him. Or Ben. Or God.

‘Guess I will,’ I say to Jaz. ‘Tell him no.’

Jaz sighs. ‘Fuck, man, fine,’ he says. ‘I’ll talk to him, but it’s all messed up now anyway. If you don’t play, you’ll be piss mad for a month. And if he says you can, you know he doesn’t want you there. See?’

‘Yeah. Fuck him,’ I say. ‘Maybe I should quit.’

‘Don’t be stupid,’ Jaz says, quieter. ‘I’m serious. You’re old as hell.’

 

On my way home, I stop for a sack of cheeseburgers and fries for me and my ex-wife and her dogs. She’s not back from work when I get there, so I let Lucious and Joffrey into the yard to run around. Our kids’ old swing set is still up and I sit in the rusty glider and light a joint. I can barely see the dogs in the tall grass; they’re chihuahuas. I’m supposed to cut the yard as part of our deal, but I’ve been off it lately. The creek behind the house is quiet, nearly dry in August, crawdads living from one shallow pool to another until a rain comes to free them. Winning the goddamn tournament is important to me. I don’t fool myself about that. That’s a mistake of youth, pretending you don’t care because you’re afraid of what will happen if you do.

Tracy comes home while the sun’s up, but fading. She calls the dogs in and lifts her hand to say she sees me. The light comes on in the kitchen. She’s still got long hair – gray now – and wears a lot of silver jewelry. Some of that silver, I gave her. She unwraps a cheeseburger, pours a carton of fries onto her plate, puts it in the microwave. She takes the hot plate out by the edges and switches off the kitchen overhead. A light goes on in her bedroom and I hear the TV laughing. I cross the lawn, climb the deck stairs and slip into the air conditioning. I carry what’s left in the greasy bag down to the basement, to eat on the hide-a-bed. It’s not a part of our deal for us to eat separately, or not talk. It just works out that way some days.

Outside, I can watch night fall and morning rise again and never get antsy. Inside, I can’t sit long. Never could, especially when Trace and I were married. We met because of the way she drove the go-carts, weaving, tailing, crashing. High, tight jeans, fringes on her shirt, honey blonde hair so long I was sure it would catch in the wheels and tear off her scalp. Ben Flett dated her too. He smoothed things over with his dad a bunch of times but, eventually, we had to ban her from Cool Crest. After that, she chose me. We drove up Ward Parkway and picked out the mansions we would live in when we got rich. We skinny dipped in the Loose Park fountain, the smell of rotting roses washing us in the dark. We dragged down Broadway, back in those years when downtown Kansas City was still gutted and empty. Later, I blamed the kids for slowing her down. She blamed me for not growing up. Basic stuff. The stuff that kills you.

When I’m full, I practice my putts on the green I made from old turf we pulled up from Course Three. I made a hole with a concrete drill, a chisel and some sneaking. I put a rug over it when I’m out, but I’m sure Trace knows I cut into what’s hers.

The hide-a-bed still smells like my kids when I open it. Candy, pee, a skin smell that’s only theirs. Neither live in town. One has a life like mine was at his age. The other is a lawyer, so far beyond Trace and me it’s like she’s behind glass when I see her. I lay down, but Ben Flett itches in my head. Tracy’s bedroom is right above me and her bedframe makes a hurrumph sound every time she turns over. Like it’s saying to us both: go the fuck to sleep.

 

Jaz is fixing the rocket when I get in. ‘Ben said to. Bob bitched at him about it yesterday.’

‘Bob is a bitch.’

‘Then why’d I see you kissing his ass yesterday, acting all friendly?’

‘Couldn’t wait till I got here?’

I don’t like Jaz messing with my course. He’s good at engines and ball machines and plumbing, but he’s got no touch for course-making.

‘I was in there talking to Ben about you,’ he says.

‘And?’

Jaz takes his hand off the rocket’s white body and its tail crashes on the green. A miniature thruster bounces loose.

‘Shit,’ Jaz says. ‘Anyway, he thought about it and he said you can play. But he wants something for it.’

What Ben wants is for Jaz and me to dress up. Crowns, scepters, velvet pants, robes. BEAT THE KINGS OF COOL CREST on the marquee outside, along Highway 40. Ben had mentioned this idea to me the past couple of years. Like it was a joke, like haha, can you imagine.

‘We’re not his goddamned clowns.’

‘He knows. He’ll pay. Hundred bucks each, plus 15 percent of day-of profits.’

A wren lands on the rocket’s nose and pops inside. Ben felt bad about yesterday, so he cooked this up. A win-win, but not really. Even with his classy St. Louis wife and his yuppy-ass Dutch Colonial on Morningside Drive, Ben has to beat me.

‘Why’s he asking you?’

‘Jesus,’ Jaz says. ‘You think he would cut you in on that deal and not me? Yeah, you still think that, I know. It’s 1975 in your fuckin’ brain.’

‘Naw. It’s 1978,’ I say.

Jaz slaps his knees and stays bent over a second, resting. He’s got cornrows pulled tight in a design that looks like lightning.

‘Decide fast. His son’s coming down here tonight to take pictures of us or something.’

Ben’s son Jonathan works for Hallmark, making birthday cards on a computer. Ben can’t shut up about it. Nothing to be so proud of, if you ask me.

 

The velvet’s polyester. The gold’s plastic. The crown’s too small on me, too big on Jaz. Jonathan’s setting up a tripod for his phone on Course Two. Jaz and I are pre-gaming in Ben’s office for whatever’s about to happen, pulling off a fifth of Jameson. Jonathan brought a mirror and our reflections won’t leave us alone.

Jaz says, ‘Not bad.’ He puffs his chest out and points one foot, like pictures of Henry VIII.

I do it and Jaz cracks up.

‘You’re more like a scarecrow type,’ he says.

He’s right. My neck’s stringy, my gut’s soft, my feet are boats. Jaz looks better, with his wide trunk, small feet, soft face. He’s wearing something invisible too, some feeling I had once but don’t anymore.

Jonathan sets us in front of the windmill on Hole Ten. I painted it back in May, but it’s beat up now from balls deflecting off the blades all summer.

‘Okay, we’re losing light,’ Jonathan says. He pokes at his phone on the tripod. He pushes a button on a little speaker and a beat starts.

‘Fuck is this?’ Jaz and I both say.

Ben holds up some cards Jonathan wrote.

I’m Rick, the old king

I’m Jaz, the new

Our kingdom is ours

But it can be yours too

Come down to our castle

Give it your best shot

Think that you can beat us?

WE THINK NOT!

BEAT THE KINGS OF COOL CREST

BEAT THE KINGS OF COOL CREST

‘Oh no. Nuh-uh. That’s corny,’ Jaz says.

‘That’s our brand,’ Jonathan says. ‘Retro-cornball-nostalgia. But we’ve actually been here for seventy years. We’re real. You guys are very real. Think, like, Beastie Boys. Remember those local ads on Channel 41? Weren’t those more fun than anything you see now?’

I say, ‘Ben,’ but Ben holds up his hands like, don’t ask me.

I start to walk away but Jaz says, ‘Fuck it.’ He stoops for the Jameson he tucked inside the windmill. ‘Let’s get this done. My girlfriend’s making tacos.’

We say the stupid lines in time to the beat. Jonathan makes us do it so many times I lose count. The more we drink, the easier it is. Jaz laughs at me, I laugh at him. To make fun of Jonathan, I put on my hick accent and Jaz puts on his ghetto one. Ben rolls his eyes.

‘Hilarious,’ Jonathan says. ‘You’re crushing this.’

Afterwards, we strip the kings’ robes off in Ben’s office. We pull our work clothes over soaked T-shirts, boxers and tube socks, our backs to each other. When we come out, ten tween boys shove past us on their way to the Fast and Furious game. The register girls lift their hands to wave goodnight to us. Ben and Jonathan tap their iPhones behind the service counter. They don’t look up.

‘See you tomorrow, I guess,’ I say.

But Jaz stares at Ben and Jonathan. ‘When I was kid, I wanted to be a man so bad. You know? A real man.’

‘Yeah.’

‘That’s why I put up with your ass, Rick,’ he says. ‘Because you do know.’

We drive off in opposite directions, drunk. I think about tonight, Jaz making his face hard, puckering his lips and squinting. And me, letting my eyes get wide, my jaw go slack, my knees pump up and down, like I was jumping to the tune of a jug.

When I get home, Tracy’s at the kitchen table with a Hy-Vee rotisserie chicken and a plastic container of mashed potatoes. She didn’t eat yet, she’s waiting for me.

‘Where’ve you been?’

‘At work.’

‘That’s BS. You smell like the floor at Kelly’s.

‘Jaz and I had a couple with Ben.’

She bites her lip. ‘It’s Thursday. I thought you’d be home.’

She’s got no right to expect me. I don’t need to tell her, she knows. But she did expect me, and I disappointed her again. I can’t hardly look at her, so I stay quiet and we eat the chicken and potatoes and watch Law and Order on the couch. I don’t say what happened today, but she can tell something did. When I get up to go downstairs, she says, ‘Sleep good,’ and smiles.

I pull out the two fifties Ben gave me from the register and let them flutter onto the couch beside her.

 

The video’s a hit. Jaz shows me on his phone a couple days after Jonathan posts it, since I don’t have all that social crap on mine. It gets hearts and likes and laughy-faces and frowns. Like pennies in a fountain, Jonathan says, good as cash if you collect enough. The comments call us all kinds of stuff. When I watch, my whole head burns.

‘Yeah,’ Jaz says. ‘This is bad.’

‘Who cares. I don’t know any of these fuckin’ people,’ I say. ‘Should we say something to Ben?’

‘Like what?’ Jaz says.

For the next week, we go on: turf drainage and PVC pipe, re-stuccoing the castle, repairing the engine that runs the golfing gnome on Hole Seven. The video goes on too.

At Walmart, I’m standing in the shampoo aisle, trying to find Tracy’s brand, when four teenage girls start giggling at the other end. When I look up, they’re chanting.

BEAT THE KINGS OF COOL CREST

One girl has her phone in front of her face, aimed at me. When I take a step toward her, they all shriek and run. It happens again at the gas station, a group of boys in the car next to me who do the whole fucking song. At the Wendy’s Drive Thru, a pimply kid shouts, ‘Oh, it’s the king, word!’

Jaz comes in one day with two black eyes and stitches up his right hand.

‘People think they can fuck around with you,’ he says, but won’t tell me or Ben what happened. At lunch, I tell him about Walmart and the gas station.

‘Rick,’ he says, quiet again. ‘What’s it feel like, when they’re laughing at you?’

Like I’m a ghost, and a fire. Like I’m floating above myself while they laugh, and like I’m an island of unwanted shit they’ve put a match to. I’m a pile of rotary phones and Bibles and Hungry Man Dinners and hand saws. I’m hair metal and horndogs and harassment.

‘Right,’ Jaz says, seeing my face. ‘But you’re not afraid they’ll kill you.’

I shake my head.

‘Don’t look all sorry for me,’ Jaz says, ‘They can try, but it’ll hurt. That’s what I show them. I’m here and they’re gonna feel it,’ Jaz says.

He tells me to fuck off back to Course Three and let him fix the loose go-cart wheels.

 

One night, I come home and I can tell from Tracy’s face she’s seen the goddamned video.

‘Oh honey,’ she says. ‘People’ll forget it in a couple weeks. It is funny.’

She hasn’t honeyed me in twenty-five years.

‘Probably have to do it every year from now on,’ I say.

She sits down next to me and takes my hard hand in her soft one. ‘Plenty of jobs around here for a man who wants to work.’

I know what those jobs are. A computer tells you what to do and watches how long it takes you. The bosses sit in their houses in the mountains or by the ocean, typing emails to make you work harder. At least Ben’s at the castle every day, ordering bags of frozen French fries, pricing golf balls, trying to get a bulk deal on toilet paper.

After Tracy’s in bed, I tap cool crest kings out on her old laptop. If I watch close, I see Jaz and me underneath the clowning. Jonathan’s right: we’re real. Maybe it’s the way we side-eye each other, like nobody could ever beat us, no matter how hard they try. Or maybe the real thing is our voices, how we spit the word BEAT like rattlers striking at a hiker who’s stumbled on our nest.

 

Ben wants us to play in costume. Jaz and I both say no. It’s going to be ninety on Saturday.

‘That’s one for, two against,’ Ben says.

‘Ain’t a democracy,’ Jaz says.

Ben smiles. ‘Fifty each?’

‘I’ll do it,’ I say.

Jaz rolls his eyes. ‘Fine. But if I die out there, you’re paying Tamara worker’s comp. We’re domestic partners.’

When we get outside, Jaz asks, ‘Why the fuck did you say yes?’

‘Fifty bucks,’ I say.

‘Bullshit,’ he says, and sends me down to flatten out the hillside where the extra Port-a-Johns will go.

 

I ask Ben if I can take the costume home. I sit in the glider after work, tricked out and roasting. There’s something about the king’s robes, though, that makes me feel good. My head throbs against the plastic crown. Sweat comes in waves and the front half of my brain goes caveman. In my mind, I play through every hole. I see the ball hitch at cracks in the concrete and zoom over bald spots in the turf. At six-thirty, Tracy opens the back door.

‘What in hell are you doing?’ she says.

I say, ‘Practicing,’ and she blows a breath between closed lips like spitting. She calls Joffrey and Lucious inside.

When the sun goes down, mosquitos stick their bloodsuckers through my costume and I wonder if I taste good, my blood thick after sweating all day. I want to roll on the ground like a dog, but I stand it. I’m almost done. And I’m the king.

Tracy comes to the door again wearing one of her night-gown T-shirts with a cartoon teddy bear saying I’m not plump, I’m cuddly! The dogs run out and nip my toes and she bounces into the yard in her bare feet, lightly, though she’s grown heavy. I want to hug her around the waist and put my face in her gray hair.

She says, ‘Richard, quit it. New SVU’s coming on in ten minutes.’

She’s halfway up the stairs, scooped poop in her Walmart bag, when I take the king off and hang him over the deck railing. My underwear is soaked and I take those off too and leave them near the barbeque. When I come inside, Tracy’s putting the show on TV and I’m in my birthday suit. She leaves the room, but she’s back before I can bolt downstairs. She’s carrying one of her Egyptian cotton towels, the ones she got at her second wedding, to a man who died a year in, who should be here instead of me. I wrap my loins in soft cotton.

‘Sit down before we miss the rape,’ she says.

 

Saturday’s bright and hot. Jaz and I run around making sure everything’s set up, then put on our costumes. The line’s out the door and the register girls ring up entry after entry. The air in Ben’s office is cranked to the max. Jaz takes Ben’s chair. I take the floor.

‘You think Ben knows?’ Jaz says.

‘Yeah,’ I say, ‘Like he cares though. Look at that line.’

All week, we’ve been improving our odds. We increased the moving object speeds. We thickened the turf around the holes to slow the puts. We put a few speed bumps in key places.

‘What’re you gonna do with your end?’ I ask Jaz.

‘Get married. Take a trip, maybe.’

‘Where?’

‘Houston. Got family there. Used to see ‘em every summer, but they don’t like me and Tamara together. Miss the ocean though. You?’

‘Family comes from Leavenworth. Garden spot.’

‘No, the money, dumbass.’

‘I don’t think about money until it’s in my hand,’ I say.

Jaz blows through his lips just like Trace. Like I’m a moron, pissing him off.

Ben comes for us. The song’s playing when we walk out.

BEAT THE KIGS OF COOL CREST

BEAT THE KINGS OF COOL CREST

The crowd cheers. Ben and Jonathan take our pictures in front of the castle. I can’t see down the hill to the batting cages, there’s so many bodies packed in.

I say, ‘Fuck,’ and Jaz says, ‘Mmm-hmm.’

First course is putt-putt, no obstacles, gotta work the angles. Sweat skis down my nose when I bend at the waist. I don’t smoke before work, but I wish I had this morning. On the Lightning Bolt, I miss my first shot and Bob and the Flying Tigers all get hole-in-ones. Bob pats my robed shoulder, like get ‘em next time. On the Maze, Jaz hits an angle I never saw before and beats me by two.

I’m standing at the last hole of Course One, three strokes down when there’s a low voice I’m not expecting.

‘Come on, Richard. You’re better than that.’

Tracy’s in the crowd. Her silver glints against her wrinkled skin and my heart sinks into my feet. She hasn’t been here in forty years. I don’t want to think about us back then, young and racing towards this.

But I get into the final hole with a single stroke and I look up at her and know she helped me in some way I can’t understand. I don’t like it, but it’s fucking true.

 

Course Two is my favorite, all mechanicals. The gnome slides his club without jerking, the rocket tips forward to balance like it’s flying, then falls to the green where the ball rattles loose from the nose. When I’m in rhythm, it doesn’t matter what speed the obstacles are set to. I’m kicking Bob’s ass on Course Two, but a skinny, teenage nerd is a stroke behind me, and Jaz is only two.

‘You two think you’re real smart, huh?’ Bob whispers to me. ‘Doesn’t bother me. I hit a Viet Cong shack from two miles up.’

I say, ‘What the fuck’re you talking about, Bob?’ and swing my hips in time to the windmill blades’ rotation.

My ball travels through the tunnel to the green on the other side. Bob’s ball hits the blade and goes sideways into the windmill where it clinks against the Jameson bottle Jaz left there three weeks ago. Bob pokes around with his club to knock his ball loose and nudges the bottle out with it.

‘You been drinkin’, Bob?’ Jaz says. ‘I mean, it ain’t the PGA but still.’

‘Shut up, Lakeisha,’ Bob snaps. He tosses the bottle back inside.

BEAT THE KINGS OF COOL CREST

BEAT THE KINGS OF COOL CREST

It’s rising from the fake-rock speakers on the ground.

Jaz laughs. ‘That the best you got, Bob? Sure you don’t have another name for me?’

Bob ignores it, but when he’s finished with the hole he looks up at Jaz and I run around the windmill to make sure somebody’s between them.

 

We cool off inside the castle before Course Three. Ben brings a bucket of ice from the concession stand for us to rub on our faces, necks, wrists, chests. We tuck Ziploc bags of it in our king-pockets because it doesn’t matter if we get wet. We’re soaking anyway and laid out on the office floor.

‘Thank you, guys,’ Ben says. ‘Really, thanks a million. You can take the costumes off now, if you want. You can put them back on for photos after.’

‘Fuck that. I’m the king,’ I say.

‘The hell you are,’ Jaz says.

‘Are you guys okay?’ Jonathan says. He’s got on square-rimmed black glasses, a short-sleeved shirt buttoned all the way to the collar. He’s been inside all day, doing computer things.

‘We look okay?’ Jaz says.

‘Honestly, I know this has been hard, but you’re doing amazing. We’re killing it.’

‘Does that mean we made fuckin’ money?’ Jaz says.

‘Yeah,’ Ben Flett says. ‘That’s what it fuckin’ means.’

 

By the time we’re halfway through Course Three, the sun’s cooking my ape brain. The air smells like marsh, highway, pizza, boiled plastic turf. Jaz is ahead of me, and Cooper, the skinny kid, is on my heels. Trace is still there, bossing me in her low voice. On Hole Ten, I throw my cape and doublet on the ground.

‘Here we go, it’s gettin’ real!’ says one of the onlookers behind me.

Jaz keeps his costume on. He’s sitting on benches between the holes. He’s turning a pale color he shouldn’t be. I tell him to take the crown off, but he won’t.

‘How you’re going to take my crown?’ he says.

‘You’re not thinking right,’ I tell him. But I’m not either, inside my own baked skull.

When Jaz gets to the eighteenth hole, he putts once, twice, three times.

‘What the fuck?’ he says, then beats the club he’s holding into the ground until it’s bent. The crowd goes silent while Ben brings him a new one.

The fuck is, at the last minute this morning, I tucked some turf pieces under the carpet of Hole 18 and didn’t tell Jaz. Speedbumps. Just in case.

I’m Rick the old king.

When it’s my turn, the ball glides up the slope and over the curving lip that pulls it across the little railroad bridge and drops it on the green for me to tap in.

BEAT THE KINGS OF COOL CREST

Jaz sheds his crown and robe. He’s in his soaked T-shirt, velvet pants, and red-and-black Jordans, pacing, watching the rest of the players putt after me, squinting at the turf.

When I go over there, Jaz says, ‘Walk away, man. Walk away right now.’

It takes an hour to finish up the tournament. I’m on top, Cooper’s second, Jaz is third. We stand on the podium we built from lumber left over after the birthday room renovation. Ben hangs plastic medals on our necks. Tracy beams and whistles, her fat fingers in her mouth. I’m cold inside, the way I was every time I came home to Tracy during our marriage after I’d made out with another woman in a bar. Cooper gets the loudest cheer.

‘Come on, do the song,’ a voice yells. The crowd takes it up.

DO THE SONG. DO THE SONG.

In the front row, Bob and the Flying Tigers are grinning. Goddamn video.

Jonathan herds Jaz and me over by the windmill. He brings the speaker and the beat starts. The crowd gets quiet. The blades are spinning out of time with the beat. Jaz is breathing heavy. He bends down for something.

‘I’m Rick, the old king,’ I say, but that’s as far as I get before the Jameson bottle cracks across my eye socket.

 

When the cops come, I don’t say a thing and neither does Ben or Jonathan or even Bob. But it’s on the local news since, these days, the news is just YouTube videos and the weather. The anchor lady has a shitty little smile on her face when she says ‘a case of kings behaving badly,’ and I’d like to be furious, but I’m not feeling a damn thing. Tracy turns off the TV and gets me another pain pill. I check my phone to see if Jaz answered my texts, but he hasn’t.

‘He’s in the wind, honey,’ says Tracy, like an SVU detective. ‘He doesn’t want to talk to you. For all he knows, you’re helping the cops.’

I never blacked out. I saw Jaz with my good eye, his robes flying behind him, as he ran to the parking lot and jumped in his Charger. I heard him roar down Highway 40 with his exhaust cut outs. He never got his cut of the proceeds, only those five seconds of satisfaction as he hunched over me screaming, that’s what you get, his Big Red gum-scented breath in my nose. I stayed down, watched my blood pour on the turf, thinking we would have to replace it. In my mind, it was already the next day, Jaz and me alone again, setting things right. But when I sat up, there were silent rectangles where faces should be. I floated above myself. My whole body burned.

I don’t tell Ben I cheated. I take my cut of the profits, give half to Tracy and send the other half to my kid in Omaha who’s always behind on his bills. Jaz never shows up again and Ben gives me the supervisor job, but it’s only a little more money and a lot more work; Ben was getting one over on Jaz. I play the courses but it’s not fun the way it used to be. When I drive by the distribution warehouses on my way home, I think about working in those cold, controlled places, alone, boss invisible. I could be a number glowing in the dark, nothing more, a real ghost. It’s tempting.

One fall night, when the air smells like football and burnt leaves, I get drunk and tell Tracy what I did to Jaz. How I stole what was his, how I took his livelihood, how, God, I didn’t mean it to go that far. I blubber it all out. How I hope he’s down swimming in the Gulf. How I miss him.

Tracy turns her head towards where I’m sitting on the couch and looks at me with sleepy, silver eyes. She’s heard my blubbering before, back when it was her I was sorry I’d betrayed. A couple years ago, she would’ve pointed that out. Now, though, she sighs, scoots closer and pats my arm. It’s nice, but some fire has left her and I miss that too.

‘It was a game,’ she says, and turns on CSI: Vegas.

‘And besides,’ she says, during the first commercial break. ‘You two weren’t the only ones playing.’

    "text": "Sr Mendes thinks I’m his wife. He speaks to me like he spoke to her, and even calls me ‘petal’ and ‘my angel’. His wife, Lígia, has been dead for twenty years – he knew this perfectly well until he turned eighty-eight.

There were three guests at his birthday party: me, one of his daughters and one of his grandsons (he has one son, four daughters, and four grandkids, no great-grandkids). We sang, clapped our hands. The birthday song echoed metallically in the almost empty apartment. The extra verse: It’s snippy, it’s snappy, now it’s time now it’s time now it’s time. Ba . . . dum . . . Our three voices and his, crackly, trying to sing along. Sr Mendes no longer had enough strength to clap, his throat couldn’t hold a tune, his lungs were weak. His grandson, who’s twenty, blew out the candles on his cake. Two candles: 8 and 8. Sad to see, but every birthday party can be mistaken for a funeral. Hip hip . . .

Silence. Sr Mendes, his grandson and his daughter smiled, all three for different reasons. I went to fetch a knife to cut his diabetic cake. Sr Mendes asked, with that raspy voice of his, where Lígia was. Did Lígia make the cake? Where’s Lígia? I came back from the kitchen saying something or other and the old man’s mind put my voice in his dead wife’s mouth, my face on the memory of her dead face. He looked at me and opened his false teeth wide:

sr m: My angel, did you make the cake?

His grandson and daughter raised their eyebrows at me: play along, it’s his birthday and nobody wants to repeat morbid news, especially not ‘Mum’s been dead for twenty years’. I said yes, I’d made the cake, which wasn’t a lie. The old man answered with an ah! and asked for a slice.

Ever since, I’m Lígia.

Sr Mendes went blind in his right eye when he was young, but his left can see perfectly. His hearing is fine. He hardly takes any pills: four in the morning, one in the afternoon and four at night. He isn’t confined to his wheelchair: sometimes he gets up and walks around the apartment, supported by a mahogany cane. Genuine mahogany, he says. He likes to go out on the balcony and take the sun.

Before he turned eighty-eight, Sr Mendes knew perfectly well that I was a man called Alex, thirty-three years old, thick beard and short hair. I’ve seen lots of photos of his wife, pictures of when she was old and young: I look nothing like her. I never met the dead woman, never heard her voice, but I’m almost certain it didn’t sound like mine. My voice is deep and throaty. I’ve got a few feminine traits, but the old man would have said something if he thought I was a fruit. He hates fruits. Nothing wrong with being homosexual – or so he often says when we’re watching TV – but a fruit, no way! The TV is always on in Sr Mendes’s house.

Now I’m Lígia because I’m Lígia. There’s no escaping it. I denied it, the old man re-denied it, I tri-denied it, he cross-denied it so many times that all that was left was a tired, defeated, affectionate yes: I’m Lígia! I’m Lígia . . .

sr m: I know, petal, I’m not all that old.

I’ve known Sr Mendes for three years. I have no nursing training. I learnt how to bake a diabetic cake on the internet. I don’t get paid to look after him. We both live in the same building, in lower Copacabana, me in No. 104 and him in No. 404. The other apartments are occupied by semi-high-class prostitutes, impoverished students, transvestites and other old people. There are dozens, thousands of old people in Copacabana. It’s a neighbourhood waiting for death. The old people here will be forgotten like the great armies. Who knows the names of all the soldiers who invaded Poland, or who landed on Omaha Beach? By a coincidence that no longer matters, I found myself in Sr Mendes’s apartment. (Pause.) Soon I was visiting him every day.

The first year was an extremely lengthy vigil: I was certain the old man, who was eighty-five then, could die at any moment. Those were anxious months. I’d often dreamt he’d died and I hadn’t been there to see it. A man should witness another man’s death, the exact moment, at least once in his life. If he doesn’t, he’ll die thinking that life amounts to no more than a stage illusion.

 

Ihave lots of deaths saved in my memory, but I saw all of them from a distance, through the TV screen. When I was younger, I collected VHS tapes of accidents, street brawls, sudden heart attacks in restaurants, shoot-outs. I bought the tapes from a newspaper kiosk on Rua Sá Ferreira. The owner was a collector of violent scenes and on a tall rack, behind the porn films and magazines, he’d hidden a whole world. There were dozens of tapes, with no covers or labels, which he got from the hands of black marketeers. Amateur recordings, for the most part, but also films made by war correspondents, videos stolen from police files and a few rare gems: the complete works of serial killers who liked to record their crimes, videos filmed by soldiers on the battlefield, every type of visual perversion. Autopsies, torture sessions, botched police operations, rapes, armed robberies, kidnappings, disgraceful orgies, suicides, revenge killings.

If a customer not in the know, rifling through the porn magazines, came across the tapes and asked what they were, the kiosk owner would say they were blanks, and not for sale. We, the initiates, knew the code. There was a ritual to be followed: we’d enter the kiosk in silence and, after a few motionless moments, ask, ‘Where can I catch the fourteen-zero-four?’, a bus that in those days didn’t exist, or if it did, didn’t go through Copacabana. Then the kiosk owner would say, ‘That one goes to Pavuna, on the north side,’ and produce the catalogue (a school exercise book with the number ‘1404’ stamped on the cover), which was divided into three sections: sex, death and miscellaneous.

 

Ionly bought death tapes. The fatal shooting of a transvestite (gunshots to their made-up face) in Kansas, in 1987. A passed-out drunk, stabbed in the neck, Nilópolis, 1991. A pregnant woman dying in childbirth, the anguished cries of her husband (I think in Russia, 1995). A hostage-taker shot in the head by an elite sharpshooter, blood spurting all over the hostage, Georgia, 1994. A man throwing himself from a building in Montevideo, 1996. Scenes from the Sook Ching massacre in Singapore. Franz Reichelt jumping from the Eiffel Tower with his parachute and smashing himself to a pulp on the ground, 1912. Video suicide note, a teenager from New Jersey blames his parents and pulls the trigger, 1997. Video suicide note, a boy in Santa Catarina puts on lipstick and swallows poison, 2000. Someone getting run over in Viña del Mar, 1989. A beating in São Paulo, 1995. An old man dying peacefully in bed in a home (somewhere in England, 1990) after recording a hello to his grandson, a soldier fighting in Iraq. And then a woman’s voice: ‘Oh my God! Grandpa! Ooooh, my God!’

I’ve still got the tapes, fifteen of them (in total, around 140 episodes), in the false bottom of my wardrobe, but I’ve no way of watching them. Who has a videocassette player these days?

Today I watch this stuff on the internet. And just like when I was a boy, I try to identify the exact moment a person dies. When their eyes fog over? When their jaw slackens? When their leg muscles become limp? When the monitor beep goes biiiiiiiiii and what’s left of the heart is a straight green line on a black background? When the people in the street stop their yelling? When somebody starts to pray, or cry? When is it that someone dies, exactly? Is it when the camera is switched off ?

The last video I watched was on YouTube. The title: ‘Dies after being clubbed in the head in street brawl. Violent scenes!’ – In media res: a skinny guy, wearing a football shirt (blue, number 10), fish knife in his right hand, up against two huge fat guys. One carries a club, the other has nothing. The set: the narrow, sunlit  streets of a poor neighbourhood. In the background, a house painted pink.

The three study each other, they step forward, and then step back again. The skinny guy lifts his leg like a Thai boxer, like a flamingo. The people watch on. Motorbikes go by. Various cries, sounds of fear and humour.

men: Get out of here, boy! Yeh! Yeh . . . Yeeeaaah!

women: Out, out . . . Aaah!

Leaping backwards, the skinny guy dodges two blows of the club, then launches himself at the unarmed fat man, but the guy with the club protects his companion, forcing the skinny guy to retreat. The unarmed man grabs a loose chunk of kerbstone and chucks it, and when the skinny guy panther-jumps backwards again, the guy with the club seizes his chance: one, two blows at empty space, at the ground, the third striking the skinny guy’s arm. Now the skinny guy advances again, fish knife poised, other arm raised in self-defence, until the fat man with the club lands one, two blows on skinny’s back.

men: Get out of here, man! Get out, man!

The skinny one charges, leaping in an attempt to bury his blade in the neck of the fat guy with the club. That’s how Achilles killed Hector.

 


 
A motorbike passes in front of the camera. The cameraman gets out of the way and without meaning to points the lens upwards. Satellite dishes and the sky, sky floating on sky, blue, clear, quiet. A few clouds. A couple of seconds of the most conventional beauty there is and here down below the skinny guy is running, he’s fleeing. His Achilles lunge has failed.

men and women: Aaah . . . eh-eh-eh-eh!

He no longer has the fish knife in his hand. Now three men are chasing him, another fat guy has joined the first two. A blow to the ground with the club. The skinny guy runs, another blow to the ground, he gets to a corner and hesitates, a misstep, and the fat guy with the club is upon him. A blow to the neck. Skinny collapses. Face down on the ground. Motionless. Another blow to the back. Shrill screams. Everyone stops watching. In the background, a small yellow house. A sign on the front says: building materials for sale. Is he dead?

(Enter a boy. About eleven. Wearing a backpack, yellow Bermuda shorts, moss-green T-shirt.) The boy wags his index finger at the three killers, who leave in a hurry, but don’t run. The boy looks at the prone body, circles it, crouches to get a look at the skinny guy’s face. He waves his arms like someone telling the referee to hurry up and blow the final whistle.

boy: He’s dead . . . ! He’s dead . . . !

End of video.

 

These are peaceful times, the TV tells us. My generation never went to war, that’s why we don’t really understand the mature work of poets. That’s why we love the brutality of posthumous things: we’re not on intimate terms with death. That was my first reason to love Sr Mendes. He saw the Second World War. His wrinkles are concrete like the ruins of Europe, where the boys born in 1934 played. Kids of eleven, twelve years of age, invaded and conquered the bombed-out city blocks, Sr Mendes told me. In 1945 and 1946, the entire continent was ruled by a government of children. Gangs of kids infested the devastated cities. He was already almost twenty, but his younger brothers loved finding abandoned machine guns and cannons in the woods neighbouring the small farm where they lived. It was a party.

When he came to Brazil, in the 1950s, Sr Mendes changed his name. I found this out in the second year of our friendship. He disembarked in Santa Catarina, but soon moved to Rio. He worked in shops, didn’t get involved in the struggle against the dictatorship. He married Lígia, they had kids and, in the end, he dedicated all his energies to getting old. I don’t know what his name was before he emigrated, I never asked.

Today, three years after I befriended him to see him die, the idea of losing Sr Mendes has left me all mixed up. Sometimes I dream about his funeral and wake up half dead myself.

Sr Mendes plays the lottery twice a week, because that way he’s always on the brink of something big. He says the lottery forces us to think about the future. Normally I’m the one who goes to buy the tickets. He always plays the same numbers: 03, 04, 14, 27, 40, 41. Last year, he got four numbers right and won six hundred reais. He split the prize with me, because I don’t have a job.

It’s been four months since I became Lígia. I still call Sr Mendes ‘Sr Mendes’, but he hears something else, perhaps ‘my sweet’ or ‘Luciano’, which is his first name. Lígia, the dead woman, must have called him that.

I’ve got used to his rheumatic affections, his gnarly fingers suddenly in my hair, on my forearms, my shoulders. Sr Mendes’s fingers are like a moose’s horns, dark and crooked. The TV always on. He smiles at me and says he’s always loved me. On sunny days or when his glucose levels are high, he squeezes my thighs and whispers pornographies in his native tongue. It doesn’t bother me.

On days when I have a foreboding he’s going to die, I spend the night in his apartment. I make up a bed in the living room, but I don’t sleep: I stand beside the old man’s bed, keeping an eye on his breathing. Sr Mendes says he hasn’t dreamt since he lost his right eye. It was his right eye that knew how to dream. His left hasn’t seen as many terrible things, he once told me. I never asked what things his right eye had seen. What his left has seen, I know: Rio de Janeiro, Copacabana Beach, Lígia.

The TV always on. We’re sitting in the living room, Sr Mendes in his wheelchair, me on the sofa, watching the telenovela. Outside, Copacabana draws in the night. The city is like the old, it wasn’t lucky enough to die young. It’s growing, swelling, creating alleys, cancerous lumps, avenidas, backstreets, barbecue joints. At some point, even the most long-standing residents get lost in it, like Sr Mendes has lost himself in me. He looks at me and says I’m sweeter than sugar. For years he’s only been able to drink diet soft drinks and coffee with sweetener. I don’t answer. I scratch my beard and think about sugar. The TV always on. The neighbours complain about the noise. The foreigners have forgotten, but there’s so much coagulated blood in our sugar, so many slaves who lost their arms in the mills, so much cold sweat in our sugar-cane juice. I don’t know whether Sr Mendes cares.

I don’t know what his nickname in the army was. Nor how he lost his eye.

I imagine how they laughed at that prophet who said that one day all the slave quarters would disappear, because the diets of the future would recommend swapping sugar for saccharin.

Panic. Luciano closes his eyes and stops breathing for a few seconds.

sr m (with a sigh): Copacabana never ends. Copacabana is the world, petal, it never ends: you can walk – remember how we used to walk? – and walk and walk and reach the end of the beach without even realising you’re at the start of the same beach again. Remember? We went right around the world and didn’t even realise. What’s it called, that snake that bites its own tail?

I sigh too, from relief.

me: ‘Ouroboros’, Sr Mendes.

sr m: That’s right, uróboro. Copacabana uróboro . . . I don’t know what I’d do without you, my angel. I’d be lost. Copacabana is the entire world. Can you hear that jackhammer? The entire world is a building site. When they’ve finished, no one will be able to leave, my angel. (Pause.) My Copacabana.

six o’clock telenovela: Get out of here, girl, so I can take a shower! You, you’re the devil! Red nail polish? Ha ha.

sr m: Ha ha!

me: I’m going to the bathroom. I’ll be back in a second.

sr m: Do the lottery results come out today, petal?

me: I’ll be back in a second, Sr Mendes. Not till Wednesday.

Before I go to the bathroom, I go into Sr Mendes’ bedroom. I look at the double bed: it was his wife’s deathbed and will probably be his deathbed too. It’s made of mahogany. The wardrobe is mahogany as well. Genuine mahogany. I open the wardrobe. While I’m choosing, I gently bite my lower lip. I know this sensation, a burning planted right in the middle of my chest. I search the drawer, I know what I’m looking for. The old man has kept all of Lígia’s clothes.

 

 


 
 

figure in the mirror: Remember the first time you put on your mother’s bra? You were home alone, the only child of working parents. Ten, eleven years old. Natural curiosity, but you’d better be quick, they might be home at any moment.

You opened your mother’s drawer – the most terrible of crimes – and hurriedly chose knickers and a bra. White. You ran out of the room and locked yourself in the bathroom. A bathroom like this one, beige and bright.

You, a boy of ten or eleven, looked at yourself in the bathroom mirror and took off your clothes. Natural. You put on the knickers. You fastened the bra by pulling the clasp to the front, below your breast, then tugged it sideways until the cups were in place, like you’d seen your mother do lots of times. The bra was far too big and you giggled nervously.

The mirror looked like this one, with a solid wooden frame. Sr Mendes wouldn’t have such good taste: Lígia, the dead woman, chose this, you’re certain. The TV always on. In the other room he coughs and calls you.

sr m: Lígia! Lígia, my angel, help me get up . . .

figure in the mirror: You had to jump up and down to see the knickers you were wearing because the mirror was at sink height. From the waist up boys and girls look the same. Then the breasts grow. Complete silence outside the room. If Dad comes home and catches me like this, he’ll give me a beating. (Pause.) You look. You recognise yourself: that’s your belly, that’s your skin, as pink as a river dolphin, those are your shoulders. But the image in the mirror looks like a doctored photo: your face stuck onto a girl’s body. It looks like the blonde girl from school. You’re looking at the photograph of a centaur, a satyr, a mermaid, some creature of the devil or other.

When you got a little older, you’d pray to God and the most famous saints that the blonde girl, one of the few blonde girls at your school, would fall in love with you. You’d haggle with the saints: just kissing will do, no need for sex. But God, who’s smarter than all the saints, knew very well you needed sex. You dreamt of meeting a blonde girl lost, passed out, in the forest, you’d save her and sex. The school on fire, you’d bravely enter the burning building to save the blonde girl and sex. The female teachers would think it was natural. Later you got older still and started to watch the death tapes. Even now you’re terrified of killing someone. If you did, you’re certain you’d kill yourself next.

You started to throb down there. Today you know the name for it. It was the same erection that Lígia’s mirror reflects now, twenty years later. You’re wearing Lígia’s bra, Lígia’s knickers. Red. Sr Mendes kept all the deceased’s clothes. You got older, but you’re not dead. Your body got darker and fatter, hairier. Your beard has just a few grey hairs.

After that first time, whenever your parents left you alone you ran straight to your mother’s drawer. You wore all her clothes, you tried on blouses, dresses, trousers, hats, shoes, sandals. But you never put on make-up, or changed your hair. Your face was still yours and would always be yours, unblemished, a boy’s face. Remember the transvestite who was murdered, shot in the face, in Kansas? The effeminate boy who killed himself in Santa Catarina? He liked to put on make-up, he wanted to be a woman, referred to himself in the feminine. You watched the video. The boy died with his mouth red with lipstick, it left marks on the poisoned cup. (Pause.) You, after all, aren’t a –

sr m: Lígia, come quick, I’m not feeling well.

 

 


 
 

Luciano was buried in the São João Batista cemetery. Only a few people saw the coffin being lowered, fewer still saw him disappear under the earth and lime. Four of his five children left before the priest had finished talking. His daughter, the only one who went to her father’s last birthday party, stayed behind to take care of some paperwork in the cemetery’s office building. She barely looked at the coffin. She didn’t look at me either. The grandchildren didn’t come. A few liver-spotted friends, as old as L and with resigned looks on their faces (they’d be next), their legs soon getting tired. They pretended I wasn’t there too. But they went no further than sidelong glances and disgusted mutterings, nor could they: I was the one who’d given my years to the dead man. They’d all abandoned him, I’d stayed. When the grave was completely filled, only me, the gravedigger and a young woman I didn’t know, and who didn’t know the deceased, remained. She had thick thighs, was wearing sandals and seemed lost. She offered me her condolences and said, ‘Excuse me, madam, do you know the way out?’

A dreadful question to ask in a cemetery.

I pointed to the gravedigger, and she went over to him. I lit a cigarette and thought about the funeral. No one had made a speech, no one had spoken about the life of the dead man. I’d have liked to say that Luciano made every decision in his life like someone planning to move to Uruguay or Paramaribo or change their sex. Who chose their brand of margarine as though the decision would fundamentally alter their fate. But who lives like that? L died of old age, it wasn’t the fault of the margarine with omega 3 and 6, free of trans fats. I’d stopped smoking four years earlier, but I picked up the habit again because it’s pleasurable, because it’s better to be dying pleasurably.

I saw him die. I saw the exact instant. Luciano had a convulsion, fell from his wheelchair, and landed on the living-room floor, the TV on: ‘It was God who sent you here,’ four characters shouted with relief on the seven o’clock telenovela. I ran out of the bathroom, in bra and knickers, knelt beside him and watched on, wide-eyed, vigilant. I didn’t cry, I didn’t say a word. I wanted to see the exact moment when Sr Mendes would die. He looked at me, at my man’s face, free of make-up, at my centaur’s body. This hairy mermaid, this satyr, this creature of the devil. I think he recognised his wife’s underwear, the bra and knickers of Lígia, the dead woman. He tried to smile, but instead he shuddered and then died.

Before he did, he told me his nickname in the army was Ludwig. And he called me Lígia, and called me Alex, and asked for a kiss. I didn’t give him one.

The eyes of a man who’s suddenly become a corpse go foggy from an epiphany, that’s a fact. And anyone who witnesses another’s death feels a jolt of relief, like someone who finally remembers where they left the car keys or their voter registration card. My first thought was ‘People really do die.’ I want to think the same thing when I witness my own death.

On the day of the funeral, as I left the cemetery, I saw a sweaty old man eating popcorn. He looked like he was lost too, like he wasn’t from this city or even this day and age. He fixed his eyes on my made-up face, my hair combed in the fashion of little old ladies from Copacabana, and smiled as though he would melt, as though he was made out of refined sugar. I didn’t like that smile, it seemed offensive. I responded with a yell.

lígia: What do you want?

I was wearing a very pretty black dress, high heels, also black, Lígia’s clothes. The widow. I hadn’t shaved off my beard (nor am I going to), despite the heat. The sweaty old man stared at my calves (unshaven, no tights) and gave a perverted smile and my anger boiled up and I advanced in his direction, my high heels sinking into the cobblestones. He kept smiling. He apologised by shrugging his shoulders. He didn’t speak Portuguese. I drew my arm back to punch him and the old man said something in desperate French, maybe he hadn’t understood me, he hadn’t understood me! I bumped my flat breasts against him, almost nose to nose, and below his nose that same smile. I didn’t actually hit the old man, but neither did he try to defend himself. He didn’t even drop his bag of popcorn. He turned his back and walked away."

    "text": "The four of them all had full-time jobs. So when the weekend rolled around, if they had no other commitments, they got together for dinner. And while it didn’t really matter who paid, they each took turns with the check, and never split it.

These dinners happened too frequently for any major changes to occur in anyone’s life during the interim, so they never had much to talk about, and the conversation tended to run in circles – the American TV shows they were watching, the newest shitty movies, or the weird or funny little details of their day-to-day, including anything they came across on the way to the restaurant.

‘If he hadn’t held me back,’ Wang Tingting gestured at Peng Fei, who sat next to her, as she leaned across the table toward Li Li, ‘I would have torn her dirty lips off.’

‘Oh, come on, not with somebody that old. The way I see it, you say she had a dirty mouth, but yours isn’t exactly clean either.’ Peng Fei extended an arm across his wife’s chest, approximating how he had held his wife back on the bus, making it seem like if he didn’t, Wang Tingting would crawl over the table and claw Li Li’s face to ribbons.

‘Get out of here.’ Wang Tingting smacked her husband’s arm away, resettled herself in her chair, and huffily lit a cigarette. She seemed to still be furious with both the old lady on the bus and with her husband.

‘There wouldn’t really have been any point,’ Li Li offered. ‘All the grannies are vicious now. She was just scolding you for not giving her a seat. If it had been that old guy – the one on the news a while ago – he would have sat down right in your lap. Did you see that story?’ As he spoke, he shot a beseeching glance at Lin Yan, who sat next to him.

‘Nope, no idea,’ Lin Yan replied quickly and with confidence. She had been this way all night, curt and clean, downing every small glassful of beer in one swallow. Whenever someone toasted her, she would fill her glass, tap it twice on the table, and drain it. When no one toasted her, she drank on her own. Half of the empties on the table and by the chair legs were Li Li’s handiwork, but the other half were hers.

There was nothing unusual in this. Lin Yan liked to drink – or, more accurately, Lin Yan was a young woman who liked to drink and could hold her liquor. She picked most of the restaurants where the four friends held their weekend get-togethers. She hadn’t grown up around here, and she didn’t like to cook, so she only ate in either the company cafeteria or in restaurants, and the weekends left her frustrated for options. She had worked in this city for many years, long enough to hate it as much as she needed it. Of course, she dreamed of leaving, but she didn’t know where she would go. She was lucky to have friends like Peng Fei and Wang Tingting. Peng Fei had been a college classmate, but they hadn’t known each other back then, and had certainly never hooked up the way Wang Tingting suspected. They connected because Peng Fei had been the last of their group to stay in town. Once Wang Tingting’s suspicions dissolved, she enthusiastically invited Lin Yan into her inner circle, and the latter graciously accepted. The Pengs’ next move had been to try setting Lin Yan up with Li Li. The two immediately hit it off – not in a sexual way, but over booze. They drank and teased each other, even making jokes about the other’s physical shortcomings (Li Li had a big head, while Lin Yan blinked too much). So they weren’t a couple; they were out and proud as drinking buddies. According to Wang Tingting, odds were good that Lin Yan was still a virgin.

‘You two ought to slow down a little,’ Peng Fei said, surveying the cluttered table in disgust before looking at his watch. ‘So are we playing cards tonight or not?’

‘Of course, why wouldn’t we?’ replied the other three almost in unison.

‘Don’t forget, we have to get going early tomorrow to help your aunt’s family move,’ he reminded his wife.

‘Oh! Right, right,’ said Wang Tingting. ‘Just don’t go too late and we’ll be fine. Quick, get the check.’

 

A four-handed card game had been the second act of their weekend dinner dates for a while now. It started one day after they had moved from a restaurant to a teahouse – an old-style teahouse, patronized mostly by middle-aged and elderly customers. Everyone around them was playing cards; the clacking of mah-jongg tiles emanated from the private rooms. Wang Tingting asked, had they given up playing cards just because they were young? Although the rest of them felt unsure about the ‘young’ part, they all agreed she had a point. The problem was that Peng Fei liked playing ‘Throwing Eggs’, while Li Li only knew how to play ‘Eighty Points’, and Wang Tingting and Lin Yan could only remember ‘Swimming Upstream’ from childhood; so, out of consideration for the women, they played Swimming Upstream. Swimming Upstream is an ancient card game, so old that it’s doubtful anyone plays it anymore. One deck of cards, high card is the five of hearts, whoever discards their hand first ‘gets upstream’ and wins the hand. The player furthest ‘downstream’ pays the winner a forfeit. Their bets never went large – only 10 yuan per hand. But the small amount never diminished the inevitable complaining, scolding and cursing, the immodest smugness of winning, or the misery of losing.

Peng Fei, who was used to playing Throwing Eggs at work with his colleagues, had a hard time hiding his contempt for such a simple game. He stuck around at the behest of his wife, who was something of an expert at Swimming Upstream. She habitually won a stack of bills from her husband, Li Li and Lin Yan, while her defeated opponents (especially the last two) slowly boiled over with vengeful embarrassment. Yet, tonight, the tables had turned: Peng Fei had the hot hand, and Wang Tingting – to everyone’s surprise – was the biggest loser. Her listlessness at dinner disappeared amid flames of rage, and she blamed her endless bad luck on the negative energy she got from the old lady on the bus. Peng Fei, of course, disagreed, and husband and wife started a quarrel that ended with Wang Tingting throwing down her cards, snatching her handbag, and storming off. Peng Fei, finally coming to his senses, jumped up and chased after her.

The remaining two didn’t want to wait for the couple to return, but they made a show of waiting anyway, and called repeatedly to the waitress for more beer.

Emerging from the bathroom, Li Li saw Lin Yan slumped into the couch and drinking silently, totally out of place amid the exuberant chaos of the cardroom. When he sat down opposite her, he asked, ‘What are we doing next then?’

‘What do you mean?’ Lin Yan retorted.

‘I mean do we stay here, or do something else?’

‘Something else? Like what?’

‘Well, we could go home,’ Li Li replied, laboring for an idea, ‘but if you feel like it’s still too early, we could go somewhere else?’

Lin Yan swirled a few of the empty bottles on the table, then planted both feet and stood up, declaring, ‘I’m not going home.’

As they paid and left the teahouse, Li Li suggested a couple of spots to Lin Yan. A bar close by was hosting an agro-metal concert that evening; looking at the time, he figured the band had probably just started. There was also a quieter bar by the university where a bunch of bearded, bald-headed artists regularly got together for profound intellectual discussions.

‘Worse comes to worst,’ Li Li continued, seeing Lin Yan pretend not to hear the first two options, ‘we can buy some booze and take it down by the lake.’

‘Down by the lake? Ha ha!’ Lin Yan cackled as they passed beneath flickering street lamps. ‘Li Li, do you really fucking think we still need to go through all that?’

‘Shit,’ Li Li spat in resentment. ‘Go ahead, you decide.’

‘Don’t ask me, I have no idea.’ Lin Yan was almost dancing through the street. ‘I–wanna–drink! I–wanna–play cards!’

Li Li stopped to observe her. ‘You look drunk. Are you drunk?’ he asked.

Lin Yan halted, and stood rigidly on the opposite sidewalk. Then, as if calling to someone on the far bank of a river, she yelled: ‘I’m NOT!’

 

They wandered aimlessly through the streets like this for a long while, neither of them knowing what to do next. Eventually, Li Li plopped down on the edge of the raised sidewalk, making it clear he was too tired to walk anymore. Lin Yan turned back and sat down beside him, resting her head against his shoulders. Many a passerby would assume that this was a romantic pair.

‘Li Li,’ said Lin Yan.

‘What’s up,’ Li Li replied.

‘My grandma died.’

‘Really? When?’

‘This afternoon.’

‘That’s no big deal. If she’s dead, she’s dead. My grandma’s dead too – that was over ten years ago.’

‘Yeah.’ A pause, then Lin Yan said, ‘When I was little, my grandma raised me.’

‘What about your parents?’

‘They were always traveling. Work stuff. Geological survey team.’

‘So are you going to go home tomorrow, or soon? To see your grandma one last time?’

‘Screw it. It’s too far.’

‘When was the last time you saw her?’

‘When I went home for New Year’s the year before last.’

‘You know,’ Li Li put in, ‘Do you remember last year when I offered to pretend to be your boyfriend and go back with you for New Year’s. You going home this year?’

‘What would I do there?’

‘That’s true.’ Li Li nodded at a trash can in the middle distance.

‘I’m exhausted.’ Lin Yan went so far as to curl an arm around Li Li’s waist.

There was a motel right behind them. Li Li suggested they buy some beer and drink it inside. ‘Not for that, just to lie down a while. Sound good?’

‘Sure,’ Lin Yan agreed.

 

They rented a room – a standard double, two twin beds with a nightstand between them. The nightstand’s lower shelf held two pairs of white slippers packaged in plastic. But they were too tired for that; each dropped into their own bed with their street shoes on. They even turned off the bedroom light, leaving the bathroom light shining.

‘We’ll fall asleep like this,’ Lin Yan said.

‘You don’t want to sleep?’

‘I don’t.’

‘Well, what then, I mean, I don’t suppose . . .’ Li Li thought about his choice of words, then went for it anyway. ‘I don’t suppose we could fuck, could we?’

‘I knew you were gonna say that,’ Lin Yan replied. ‘Although, I guess there’s no reason we couldn’t.’

‘Exactly,’ Li Li replied as he crawled from his bed over to hers. That was as far as he went; he didn’t try anything else.

‘Oh please. You actually took that seriously?’ Lin Yan said, but didn’t push him away. Instead, she inched over to one side to give him space to lie down. ‘On that note, Li Li,’ she continued, ‘how come you’ve never had a girlfriend?’

‘You can’t really put it that way.’

‘What do you mean?’

‘I mean I’ve just never had a steady girlfriend, someone I could bring out to meet you guys.’

‘So like fuck buddies?’

‘Calling it that seems a little demeaning – not to me, I don’t care, but demeaning to the other person.’

Lin Yan laughed. ‘You might be giving yourself too much credit. In her eyes, or theirs, you might just be a fuck buddy.’

‘Okay, maybe you’re right. So . . . you have a lot of fuck buddies?’

‘Go to hell.’ Lin Yan sat up, not in anger but because it made it easier to swill her beer.

Li Li pushed himself into a sitting position beside her as he pressed his point. ‘I have always wondered why the two of us never made out or hooked up. Why is that, do you think?’

‘Do you need another hook up?’ Lin Yan asked.

‘Don’t be ridiculous. Need has nothing to do with it.’

‘Then call one up. Or call a hooker, I don’t care.’

‘Now?’

‘Yeah.’

‘What about you?’

‘I’ll watch you get it on.’

‘Just stand to one side and watch?’

‘If it feels awkward to you,’ Lin Yan said as she scanned the room, ‘I can hide in the closet.’

Li Li imagined the scene: Lin Yan hiding in the closet while he and another woman made love. But as the scene was occurring in his imagination, Li Li couldn’t picture himself as the man having sex on the bed. He became another voyeur: a voyeur of a voyeur voyeuristically observing a scene of a man and a woman making love. This made him seem like even more of a pervert than Lin Yan.

‘Looks like you need a hook up more than I do,’ Li Li sighed. ‘Let me help you.’

He made a move, which Lin Yan deftly avoided; she said nothing, but turned on the light. It was a clever move, as the lights killed the conversation immediately. To spite her, Li Li turned on the television. The news was on: marine patrol on the Yangtze River had gotten a report that a young woman had jumped off the big bridge in Nanjing. They immediately dispatched a speedboat to rescue her, and eventually recovered the body from the river. But who was the young woman, and what had driven her to take her own life? These questions remained subjects of investigation. When the reporter interviewed the marine patrolman who performed the rescue, the patrolman described seeing the suicidal woman using a simile that Li Li found interesting: ‘From far off, she looked just like a plastic bag floating in the river.’

Li Li thought it was a juicy turn of phrase, and Lin Yan agreed. The two of them dissected the metaphor with enthusiasm. Then Li Li suddenly asked, ‘Lin Yan, have you ever thought of suicide?’

‘Have you?’ she replied.

Neither of them answered.

 

Somehow, they went right through all the beer they had bought. Li Li didn’t know what to do next, so he said he wanted to go home. Lin Yan disapproved. ‘Are you drunk?’ she asked.

‘No . . . I’m really not.’ Li Li shook his large head and said in surprise, ‘I’m actually sober.’

To prove his sobriety, he brought up the death of Lin Yan’s grandmother. Lin Yan said she had sobered up too, and told Li Li about some divorcée that Wang Tingting mentioned to her before dinner. According to Wang, the guy had just got divorced, but he had a little money, and he wasn’t bad looking, so Lin Yan ought to give him a try. Li Li smacked his forehead and said he knew the guy, too: his name was Li Ruiqiang. He remembered him because Li Ruiqiang liked wearing scarves – a thick one in winter and a sheer one in summer – and talking about Marguerite Duras and Eileen Chang. But Li Li didn’t know him very well.

It seemed that the two of them really had sobered up.

‘So go get us some more beer.’

‘If you want more, you go.’

They descended again into a back-and-forth of you go, no, you go, which inevitably involved pushing, tugging, and other horseplay, and they kept at it, laughing and making the other laugh.

The following day, Li Li recalled that he had been the one to leave the motel for more beer. He had gone to the 24-hour convenience store, woken up the sleeping cashier, and bought an entire plastic bag’s worth of bottles. But as he left the store, he noticed a taxi had just parked at the curb right in front of him, so he stepped into the back seat with the beer like nothing else had happened and went home. The bottles of beer on his kitchen table could serve as proof.

Lin Yan remembered differently. She said that neither she nor Li Li had gone out for beer. She said they found two more bottles of beer plus a bottle of whiskey in the motel refrigerator. These had gone untouched by others because they were for purchase, but they consumed them anyway, along with the potato chips and spiced fava beans that were also for sale. They even found a pack of playing cards in one of the desk drawers, so they sat on a bed, drank, and played cards. Since there were only two of them, they couldn’t play Swimming Upstream, so they switched to blackjack. Li Li hadn’t wanted to play at first, but his interest picked up when Lin Yan said they should play it strip. Once their clothing was gone and they had nothing more to bet with, Lin Yan suggested they scratch each other’s noses, the winner curling their index finger and dragging it down the bridge of the loser’s nose. Of course, they were gentle with each other at first, but then one of them started using force, and by the end they were scratching each other so ferociously they drew blood, leaving stains across the duvet."

    "text": "Tom Flower crouched by the bathtub. The extractor fan was broken. The only sound was the scrape of plastic toys on the enamel tub as he gathered them – a fireman, a riderless horse, a grinning pig. He dropped them into the toy bucket. His daughter’s clothes – her socks, knickers, yellow leggings, mermaid top, were still strewn on the bathmat. His black cat mounted the lidded toilet. Someone knocked on the front door twice.

There had been a period when the toy bucket was attached to the tiles above the bath, held there by suction pads. But twice, at night, the pads had failed, sending the bucket clattering into the tub. On the second occasion, it had woken his daughter. He had gone into her room.

‘What’s happening?’ she’d said.

‘Nothing’s happened,’ he’d said, and he’d sat with her. He’d reset the lullaby function on her night light.

On the doorstep, in the glare of the security lamp, was a thin, bearded man holding a black, breathless terrier. There was a smooth, mask-like quality to the skin of his face. He sniffed. A silver ring in his nostril. ‘I’ve had Botox, Tom,’ the man said. The dog in his arms appeared frightened. ‘And a hair transplant,’ the man continued, shifting the animal’s weight.

‘Michael,’ said Flower.

It was a decade since the damp-blighted flat above the Failsworth sweet shop. A year, perhaps, since the chicken burgers and dense fog in the layby on the A590.

As he stepped into the hallway Michael Donovan glanced at a framed black and white photograph of a couple kissing in 1950s Paris. With their eyes closed they clasped each other’s cheeks so their faces were largely obscured. Donovan’s woollen overcoat was lined with black silk. He hung it on the newel post. ‘My teeth are new, too.’ He turned to face Flower, but kept his mouth closed.

‘I bought a cat,’ Flower said. ‘Is it OK with them?’

‘He’s a complete softie.’

‘I’m just going to –’

‘I can’t stay long.’

‘Just give me a moment.’

‘I’m up to see my brother,’ Donovan called out as Flower ascended the staircase in four long, careful strides.

His daughter lay on her front, hiding her face with her hands, her duvet and teddies crumpled at her feet. ‘It’s OK,’ he said. She peeped at him. Her hair was still damp. He pulled the duvet over her.

‘Uncle Michael’s turned up.’

‘Who’s Uncle Michael?’

Flower tucked the duvet into her sides.

‘Do you remember the man we played football with?’

‘In the park?’

‘In the backyard.’

She shook her head.

‘Tall. With a beard.’ Flower mimed the dimensions of Donovan’s facial hair, showing her how it began bushy before tapering to a point. ‘Oh,’ his daughter said, and Flower kissed her. He whispered into her ear – no words, just, pss pss pss pss. She gave a hissy laugh, attempting to guard her ear with her shoulder. She wrapped her arms around his neck and again he whispered, pss pss pss pss. He unhooked her arms from his neck.

On the landing, he peered into his bedroom. His cat sat on the unmade bed. She blinked her green eyes slowly as he closed the door.

Downstairs, he found Donovan on the grey settee, his legs crossed at the thigh.

‘All right?’ said Donovan. His trouser leg had ridden up, exposing a section of practically hairless calf. ‘They’ve basically –’ He bowed his head. ‘The scars have basically healed.’ He stroked his crown. ‘And I’ve deleted the dating apps. I’ve started go-karting. Have you got any gin?’

‘I could ask my neighbour.’

‘It’s funny –’

‘She’s lovely –’

‘Hello –’

‘I can –’

‘Hello!’ Donovan clasped the black dog. ‘You’re a good boy, aren’t you?’ He gripped the dog and put it into a headlock. ‘You’re a good boy, aren’t you? You’re a good boy. Aren’t you? Eh? Eh?’ He placed the dog onto the floor and addressed it in an urgent, fearful voice. ‘Ronnie, where is it? Where is it, Ronnie?’ The dog became alert, crouched, preparing to pounce or give chase. ‘Ronnie, where is it? Where is it?’ Donovan grabbed the animal and embraced it. He hummed tenderly as it tried quite desperately to lick his face.

‘There’s a track in Lewisham. Petrol-powered karts. I hire one of their helmets, but I’ve bought my own inlay –’

‘What’s that?’

‘A sort of thin balaclava, for under your helmet.’

‘It’s good to see you.’

‘I scream as I race.’ Donovan gritted his new teeth. ‘I scream non-stop. If I screamed here how I scream on the kart your neighbour would call the police. She wouldn’t hesitate.’ He looked away, stroking the dog’s head. ‘We’re karting up near Preston tomorrow, my brother and me. I’d invite you . . .’ He looked around the room, at the framed posters for art exhibitions, at the small white television, at a thick fantasy novel on the small coffee table.

‘How are you, Tom?’

‘I’m well.’

‘I mean everything’s bad, really. Right?’

‘I’ll get us some water. I keep forgetting to drink.’

Flower passed along the hallway to the kitchen.

Donovan called out, ‘Hey, what about the football?’

‘I know.’

Flower’s phone lay face down beside the gas hob. He picked up a yellow safari jeep from the floor and put it on the countertop. He picked up a pink monkey and a tiger costume.

‘I don’t get excited anymore,’ Donovan called out.

‘Hang on.’

His daughter’s mother had messaged: I’m not angry . . .  just sad xx

Flower replied: Michael Donovan’s just turned up drunk with a dog xx

He took two glasses from the cupboard, filled one with cold water and drank several deep draughts with his eyes closed. He set the glass on the drainer and filled the other.

In the living room Donovan was on his phone. Flower set down the glass of water beside the fantasy novel.

‘I got pretty desperate last year,’ Flower said.

‘What makes you say that?’

‘I was pretty desperate –’

‘I completely mastered the dating apps, Tom.’ Donovan uncrossed his legs and leaned forwards. ‘I’d match with someone and send her a bat emoji. Here is my bat, I’d say. Then I’d make a precise observation about one of her photos, like, Your dungarees are beautifully ironed. Then for a while I’d continue to be playful until suddenly I’d say: I’ve just come out of a long-term relationship. I’m not looking for anything serious. I totally understand if you’re on a different page. That was the secret – is the secret, to totally understand.’

Several raisins were strewn across the dusty hearth. In the gas fire briquettes of imitation coal were draped in cobwebs. Flower stood on a small blue rug he’d purchased some months ago. The checkout assistant had said, ‘You like blue things, I’ve noticed.’ And Flower had walked out into the carpark. It was morning still and only a few cars were there. He pressed his key fob. The sound his car made was the clunk of its doors unlocking in unison. He put the folded rug on the passenger seat. He held the steering wheel. Through the windscreen were thirty or forty empty parking bays, a row of sycamore saplings and an elevated section of a motorway that encircled the city. He switched on the radio. A DJ described a night out in London during which a famous actor had recognised him. He told the story in a shocked voice, attempting to convey the discombobulation he’d experienced. ‘He recognised me,’ the DJ said, in summary. ‘Mind blown.’ Flower twisted the key and the engine started. ‘I repeat: he recognised me.’

‘I’ve got a new technique,’ Donovan said.

‘Do you mind if we go into the kitchen?’

‘I’ve got a new technique.’

‘I need to eat.’

Donovan lifted the black dog onto the floor. It padded across the mat, sniffed a raisin, then gazed up into the chimney breast.

On the kitchen table was a miniature pot of apricot yoghurt, its licked lid, and a gnawed raw carrot in a shallow plastic bowl.

Flower opened the fridge and took out a white onion and a courgette. He sliced the onion in half and peeled away the skin.

‘I go out in London dressed as Jesus.’ Donovan stared at the artwork on the fridge door – a tissue paper dog, a jellyfish made out of glitter and a paper plate. ‘We’re older than Jesus ever was. Sometimes I go out in a high-vis boiler suit. I go up to strangers and start talking. If they ignore me, I just move on. But generally, people are like, “Oh my god, I wish people talked to each other like this more!” I invite old friends down from the north and I wingman them. Guys that have literally never approached a girl. I dress as Christ, or in my boiler suit, and sometimes they tell us to go away, but one guy, this guy I’ve known forever, who’s never had any luck, got three numbers. And yes, of course, they all ghosted him. But that’s not the point.’

Flower broke cloves from a garlic bulb. With a small knife he skinned them, then crushed them with the heel of his hand. Donovan came to stand at his shoulder.

‘I address these big, open questions to women. Then I just listen.’

Flower set a frying pan on the hob, lit a flame beneath it and poured in oil. He picked up the chopping board and swept the diced onion and garlic in. He set down the board and began to slice the courgette.

‘You wouldn’t have to dress up, Tom. I’d be Christ. Or I’ll wear the boiler suit. You could wear what you want.’

The onion and garlic were sizzling gently. Flower swept the sliced courgette into the pan and turned down the gas. He took a neon pink fish slice and stirred the contents of the pan. He ground pepper over the softening vegetables.

‘It’s good to see you, Michael.’

Flower turned and leant against the counter. He frowned and it felt like a dragonfly had landed between his eyebrows. ‘I do think of you,’ he said. He took the kettle from its cradle and filled it. He took a half-full carton of passata from the fridge and emptied it over the frying food. He looked into the black window, first at his reflection, then at Donovan’s. He washed out the carton. The sauce and the water drained from the sink and he felt, for a moment, lungless.

He left the kitchen. Donovan followed. At the foot of the stairs, Donovan said, ‘Would you know I’d had Botox?’

‘I can tell because you’ve told me.’

‘I want people to know.’

The black dog padded out of the living room. Donovan picked it up and followed Flower up the stairs. Outside his daughter’s bedroom, Flower said, ‘I just want to check on her. There’s no need to be quiet. In fact, I’m convinced whispering wakes her.’

Her bedroom was small. A wardrobe, the little bed, a pink plastic piano. On her bedside cabinet a blue star emitted a low light.

‘Oh my God,’ Donovan said, looking at the child.

She lay on her back. She’d kicked the duvet down the bed and it was bunched up. Her bare feet rested on it, slightly elevated. Her pyjama trousers didn’t match the fleece top. Her hair was dry. Her eyelids were pale pink. Her mouth was open.

‘She’s so big!’

‘You don’t have to whisper.’

Flower lifted the child’s legs and guided her feet under the duvet. She stirred. Flower tucked a plastic baby beside her pillow. Beside the blue star were two picture books. One depicted a family’s attempt to excavate a tree stump in their garden. The other was set in ancient Egypt and concerned a spate of robberies. Jewels were being stolen from the eye sockets of gold statues at night. To catch the thief, a young woman painted her face gold and stood motionless among the statues, waiting.

‘You should warn me,’ Flower said. ‘Next time you’re up.’

Donovan crouched and let the black dog step from his arms onto the bedroom floor. It sniffed at the pink leg of the plastic piano, then peered into the light of the landing. The child swallowed, reaching out with slow, slack hands, then she rested them on the duvet and her breath settled.

‘I bought Football Manager on my laptop last week,’ said Donovan. ‘I couldn’t resist it. I played for nearly four days without sleeping, managing Blackpool. I signed a guy called Malandrino – a sixteen-year-old from Verona. In the Champions League final he scored a diving header against Dortmund. He played into his forties. I was so tired. Each time we won something I ran around the flat, shouting his name and –’ Donovan clasped the black dog and raised it above his head like a trophy. He shook it gently, evoking the sound of a crowd of men, all screaming ‘yeah’ in unison.

In her bed the child licked her lips, raised her eyebrows.

‘Malandrino,’ Donovan whispered, and the child sat up and opened her eyes. She looked at her father, then at Donovan, then at the black dog in his arms.

‘What’s happening?’ she said.

And though he knew she wasn’t truly awake, Flower said, ‘Nothing’s happened’, and he watched as she closed her eyes calmly and lay her head on the pillow.

He hurried down the stairs. He took the pink fish slice, turned off the gas and chiselled at the burnt food. ‘It’s OK,’ Flower said. He went to open the window. ‘I like burn. I don’t mind burnt food.’

Donovan stood in the kitchen doorway on his phone.

‘We’ll go,’ he said. ‘We’ll leave you.’

Donovan filled a bowl at the sink and put it on the floor. He called for the dog. There was the sound of claws on wood and then the animal arrived. It saw the bowl and began drinking frantically from it, lapping until the bowl was empty and it tipped and rolled, settling noisily, upside down on the tiled floor.

‘Earlier, on the train, I looked him up,’ said Donovan. ‘Malandrino. He’s at Verona. Sixteen. His whole career ahead of him.’

Flower followed Donovan down the narrow hallway. He slipped past as his friend put on his coat and opened the front door. Out of the darkness came a black car, its headlights illuminating the rain-slick road and the low branches of a tree.

‘Goodbye, Michael.’

Flower stroked the dog and smiled at it. He tickled its chin and said it was a pleasure to have met it. Then his voice deepened and he said, quietly, to his friend, ‘See you’.

Donovan descended the front steps and carried his companion to the car. Flower watched the vehicle drive away, till it was just a pair of red lights, then he watched the lights disappear around the bend.

He scraped the burnt food into the forest green kitchen caddy. He climbed the stairs. He allowed the cat to leave his bedroom. In the bathroom he opened the hot tap and water poured into the bathtub. He depressed the plug and ran a wet hand through his thinning hair. The cat blinked at him from the toilet lid. He removed his slippers, his tracksuit bottoms, his underpants and shirt. The water kept pouring and steam rose. He picked up the toy bucket and pressed its suction pads against the tiles, as hard as he could, then let go.

    "text": "The creature arrived in the deep of the night, as a ball of fire floating in the sky, and as it circled the cottage, Margot held her baby tight against her chest, as if it was the last time she was ever going to hold him, and she avoided the imploring stares of the old women, Estelle and Bhanu, who were crouched beside her on the floor, as the ball of cold, yellow flames flew around outside, ravenous, rippling against the dark and searching for a way into the cottage, as Margot clenched her fists and inhaled deeply, and found herself thinking about how cruel her fate was, how, soon, at midnight, after so many centuries of strife, the country, poised to gain Independence from England, would finally be out of the white man’s hands, free and ready to heal itself from years of exploitation, and she let out a brittle laugh as she considered that this was supposed to be a jubilant occasion for everyone – a time for gatherings, for music, for dancing, new clothes, and good food, and heavy drinking – but instead, for her, and for her baby, this night was one that had festered, turning misery-stink, swelling with fear, and, as she thought about these things, she saw, out of the corner of her eye, the fireball spinning, non-stop, lighting up the windows of the cottage as it passed by, a long plume of smoke trailing behind it like a malignant tail as it searched for a space at the bottom of the door, or between the hinges, or a key hole, or a crack in the wood of Margot’s home that it could use to slink through, and then proceed to bite into the tender body of Margot’s baby so it could feed, and Margot shivered at the thought, and clutched the child closer, and upon feeling Bhanu’s urging hand on her shoulder, she realized there was no other way out of it, and she had to do what they had planned to do if she wanted to save her baby, and so she gave the child a kiss on his forehead, let him breathe against her cheek, and then said to him, in a hard and desperate tone, as if forcing the words to become true, she said, grinding her teeth, Mama gon come back soon, and before the tears, hot, and lingering just behind her eyes, started to fall again, she handed the baby over to the women, as the revolving fireball, like a star cast out of heaven started to burn more and more, brightening the floor and the walls with its harsh glare, its gold flames desperately trying to reach into the womb of the house as it sensed, and sought to claim, the blood that ran through the child that the three women shielded with their bodies, and Estelle, her eyes wide and holding the fire within them, turned to Margot in a panic and said, Quick, quick, yuh must go now, as she swaddled the baby in her arms with a comforter, and Bhanu, who had already wrapped the chopped onions, cloves of peeled garlic and handfuls of hot scotch-bonnet peppers into the jute sack that she handed to Margot, whispered, This fireball looking fo a way in, and it going to find one soon enough, so you best make haste, and get to de skin befo it too late, so Margot clutched the jute sack to her body, as if it was her own heart that had somehow manifested itself outside her chest, and she rose to her feet, and she tried to ignore the creature roving along one wall of the house before coming to settle behind the front door, and as Margot headed to the window opposite the doorway, she looked back and saw Bhanu ripping open one of several bags of raw rice that she dumped out onto the floor, the tiny white grains pinging against the wood, bouncing everywhere, and as Margot opened the window, and felt the grasping of the cool nocturnal air against her clothes, and lowered herself on to the black ground, she heard the unspooling of another layer of protection, as Estelle’s and Bhanu’s voices, rising from low rumbles to full-throated shouts, launched curses at the creature, and as Margot fled into the thick night, tramping the soft grass beneath her feet as she ran, swatting white-lit fireflies out of her way, in her mind, she could see them, these two old women, Estelle, with several of her fingers stiffened from years of untreated arthritis, and Bhanu, hunchbacked, bent like a sapling carrying a heavy fruit, holding the child between them, surrounded by a circle of rice, ready to face off against this thing that undulated outside the cottage, and she could hear their drifting voices, as Estelle screamed, No more, yuh blasted bitch, yuh best get yuh nasty rass away from here, right now, and leave this chile alone, because yuh big, stinking self won’t get a drop more of he blood, so yuh going to starve tonight, LOUSE, and then Bhanu cried out, Get from here, whore, with yuh dutty soul, and go back to hell, and if you only try and enter this house, see if I don’t chop yuh right across yuh face with me cutlass, yuh ugly, old WITCH, and Margot was running as fast as she could, her skirt kicked high, dashing against the dark, hurrying past the paddy fields, glimmering wet in the moonlight, Margot, whose feet seemed to work on their own, having memorized the pathways laced through the village and knowing where to take her, Margot, who moved so fast she barely had time to register the tender, pearly glow of the stars in the night sky, or the crescent moon that was matching her pace from behind a cloud, or the outlines of the nearby houses, each cottage resting on the ground like a troll, eyeing her every step, each one empty, as most of the villagers had long departed for the capital city, or other towns, for the Independence celebrations, and when enough time had hurtled by and she realized that Estelle’s and Bhanu’s curses had been strangled by the night, forcing her to look back, Margot saw her illuminated cottage, and the creature, now firefly-small in the distance, still dancing in the air, and casting its ghastly light over the building, which was so rudimentary, Margot realized, made of nothing but thatch and driftwood, and it was then that she faltered, stopping in her tracks and looking back at her tiny home, and the glowing monster looming above it, and as she thought of her son, unwanted images pushed themselves to the forefront of her eyes, so that she saw the creature’s red mouth pressed against her baby’s arms, and then his legs, draining the blood from him so his skin turned as white as old, forgotten rice, and she pressed her body against one of the nearby mango trees lining her path, and she let her weight fall against the trunk, even though she knew that the bit of time she had managed to snatch should not be squandered, and Margot found herself weeping, her tears dripping down her face and salting the roots of the tree that was providing her with respite; I can’t go back, Margot said to the night, biting back sobs, and swallowing them whole, I can’t go back, I can’t go back, I can’t go back – not yet, before wiping her eyes and forcing away her hostile thoughts, focusing again on the things she could see, the things that were real, the jute sack in her hands, the rough bark of the mango tree, the cloud of leaves rustling above her head, the toads scattered all around her, leaping as high as her knees, and then she made her legs move again, shaking the burn out of them, and she started to run once more, so the sweat on her skin went cool in a sheath of breeze, and as she ran, she told herself that she needed to trust Estelle and Bhanu, and their promise to guard her baby while she sought out the fireball’s skin, that these were fierce old ladies, women who had survived years of protests and hard living, and so, on she ran, and it was only when she could hear the murmuring of the surf that Margot realized how far she had run; she had managed to reach the edge of the village, where the land gave way to the sea, and when she looked out on to the stretch of sea water, it was shocking in its vastness and its greyness, and, as she sprinted past, she found herself thinking about her baby’s father, as it was years ago on a sunny day at this same bit of coastline, where he had stood, with the rest of the troops that had been called in from England – to enforce control, to imprison political leaders, to destroy books, to quash any possibility of dissent – holding their rifles aloft and practicing their shooting, yellow sparks bursting, and tendrils of smoke bleeding, from the tips of their weapons with the release of every wave of gunfire, and, as she had passed those white men, in their brown soldier’s outfits, each one red in the face, arms peppered with mosquito bites, she had noticed Arthur, with his strong stance, and his large, handsome nose, and the wisp of a golden moustache above his upper lip, and she was young enough to be impressed by those things, and foolish enough to ignore what others told her about him, so she never pushed back, not even when he said, My dearest, what I do, I do for my country, and for you, and it was only much later, when he had leeched all the happiness from her life, draining her, so she became melancholic and dreary, while, after the revelation of her pregnancy, he constantly seemed to be brimming with a frigid meanness, that she came to understand who he really was, and, as Margot bounded along the beach, the hill finally emerging from the shadows, she tried to force Arthur from her mind, thanking God that he had boarded a ship for England as soon as Independence became a certainty, and that she had, instead, met Estelle and Bhanu, who had heard her complaints about the strange marks on her baby’s body, and her cries about how the child remained thin and sickly, even though she nursed him as much as she could, and who had seen, one night, a ball of flames bouncing from a certain hilltop, then flying along the shore, and over the flooded paddy fields, and above the village, only to vanish into Margot’s home, and she was grateful that they saw this, and put two and two together, and came to her with a plan to stop the wretched fireball, and, as she began the climb up the mound of hard-packed dirt that made up the hill, Margot felt the pain deepening in her legs, her breath becoming ragged, a dart throbbing in her ribcage, but she fought on, and kept hauling herself up, willing her feet to keep moving, and when she looked down on the entire village, she felt as if she was flying alongside the stars in the sky, and as she neared the top, she noticed, along the distant horizon, silent from afar, a bit of the capital city, jutting out into the sea, and adorned with minute white lights that blinked at her across the water, and when she turned and looked at the village once more, in the direction of her cottage, she saw the creature was nowhere to be seen, the flames gone, which, she knew, could only mean that it had found some way to enter her home, some tiny cavity that they had missed and failed to stopper, through which it could pour itself, as a stream of black smoke, before rising up, in its deadliest form, before the old women and the baby, and as Margot hurried up the last of the hill, terror bristling along her back, she could see, in her mind, the creature standing in her cottage, without fire now, humanoid, and skinless, with sagging teats, a head full of long strands of grey hair, its mouth a gnash of teeth, its fingers that it used to smooth over bite marks – so, in the morning, the victims’ mothers could never be sure what had left the black blemishes on their children’s skin – elongated and tipped with talons, and as Margot felt her feet slowing down again, as the weight of the sight in her head threatened to saddle her and drag her down, she clutched her jute sack tighter, and reminded herself about the rice Bhanu had poured, the rice the creature was doomed to count, grain by grain, before it was able to cross the threshold and launch an attack, and Margot knew there were thousands of grains in the bag that Bhanu had opened, with several unopened bags remaining if she needed them, which meant the fireball was doomed to spend all night there, clacking its claws against the wooden floor as it lifted each bitter seed of rice to its yellow eyes to count them, one by one by one, until daybreak came, forcing it to flee, so Margot kept up her pace, moving fast, and as soon as she reached the top of the hill, she threw herself at the foot of the lone calabash tree standing there, a gnarled sentinel, its branches knotty and twisted, like the limbs of a deformed skeleton, and, in a small hole, hidden between the tree’s tangled roots, Margot found what she was looking for, and she immediately pulled out the swathe of soft skin, and unfurled it, and dusted the little pebbles from it, and then she opened her jute sack, so the smell of garlic, onions and peppers erupted, blasting into the air all around her, and as she used her bare hands to ground the aromatics into the skin, the sharp and heavy scents prompted a memory of Margot’s father, who, when she was a child, worked hard, from Sunday to Sunday, morning to nightfall, in the kitchen of Mr. and Mrs. Galveston, a white couple, who lorded over the main street in the nearby town, and Margot had visited her father at work on several occasions because that was the only way she got to spend time with him, and he would let her peel the milder vegetables, while he cut the meats, salted the marinades, kneaded the dough, chopped provisions, washed rice and ground the onions, garlic, peppers, scallions, parsley and thyme to make green seasoning, while monitoring the many pots, each one hissing and bubbling over yellow flames, with sweat lining his neck as he fanned himself with an old newspaper, and reminded her to ensure that she was never alone with Mr. Galveston, and then made her laugh by telling her stories of spirits and ghouls, and now as the seeds from the peppers exploded into the fireball’s skin, and the garlic bulbs were rubbed in until they were invisible, and the onions were pounded in until only tiny white slivers were left behind to shine in the moonlight, Margot wrapped the skin, just as she had found it, and carefully tucked it under the old roots of the calabash tree, and even though she was almost blind from the stinging of her eyes, and her hands felt as if they were aflame, Margot knew it would be worth it, when, in the final grey minutes before morning came, the fireball would fly to this spot to escape the sunlight, and attempt to don its skin to return to its human form, to hide itself in plain sight, but this time, it would find destruction wrapped within itself, and as Margot stumbled down the rocky terrain of the hill, her entire body feeling as if it was on fire, she thought about her father, who had dropped dead in that heated kitchen, where so much of his life had been sapped for so little, and she thought of the Galvestons, too, wondering if they were on the same ship as Arthur, back to England, and Margot also thought of the fiery monster that had sought to harm her son, and she almost smiled when she envisioned how the creature would howl as its tainted skin started to sizzle on its body, as it tore into itself, and tried to return to its fireball form, only to find that it was too late, that the skin would not come off, and it would writhe in burning anguish, and die, on the same hilltop it had stolen and secured for itself, so long ago, to make its home among its victims, and Margot told herself that this was what the creature deserved for wanting to feed on others, and, as she descended, she muttered out loud, Go back to hell, demon – where yuh belong.

At the foot of the hill, Margot crouched in the grass. She rested her legs and allowed her breathing to return to normal.

When she was able, she stood and walked to the beach.

She looked across the water, at the capital city, as fireworks were released in a dazzling display of lights. They shot high into the air and shimmered in place before exploding into large, soundless sparks. They were so far away from her, but Margot knew the importance of those lights.

She crossed the spit of sand and approached the murky sea.

She let the waves splash over her feet, as she bent and washed her hands and arms. When she was done, her fingers were cool but still burning slightly. She held her hands out to the wind and thought of her child. She watched the horizon, dotted with fireworks and white stars, and waited for the dawn that was to come."

He’d called the office and asked how he was supposed to rid the excavation site of monkeys. ‘For good,’ they’d said. The instruction was curt and final: ‘You know how to do it.’

Darmin opened the supply closet, took out an air rifle, pumped it, loaded the bullets, tiptoed to the window, cracked it open, and peered out from behind the curtain. There were a few monkeys in the yard. Macaques. Two of them were fighting over a plastic bag, the others just milled around. He looked for the biggest and found it sitting near the bushes, watching over his troop. Darmin got in position. He could hear himself breathing. He aimed at the monkey’s chest, but at the last moment raised the rifle just a hair or two above the monkey’s head.

The shot rang out. He saw the big monkey startle and run, heard hoots and screams as the troop fled into the thicket, reaching for twigs and clambering up branches.

He went out of the house, still carrying the rifle. The monkeys were gone from the yard now. They’d been a problem for weeks. A rifle shot could scare them away, but they always came back. It was annoying, but it was his job.

He stood watch in the yard in case the creatures returned. He could still occasionally hear their shrieks, but there was no other sign of them.

The residential units for the workers consisted of a few bunkhouses each. They stood in a row looking out on a small yard, which also functioned as a dirt road, and a ridge beyond that. Three bachelors lived in the house on the right, but they’d all gone out that morning to inspect a line-up of excavators. The house on the left had been for the company doctor, a middle-aged man who’d arrived with his wife and small daughter. But the child couldn’t bear the monkeys and so they’d moved back to the city. Now the doctor came and went every day, about an hour’s drive. Darmin lived alone. A kid fresh out of college had been rooming with him, but when the monkeys arrived, he’d gone back home without a word.

The monkeys here were mercilessly stupid. Their brains had been braised by the sun. They had watched the huts being built along the slope of the hill, hundreds of workers arriving with their trucks and heavy machinery. When the trucks roared and whined, they should have known to withdraw further into the jungle. Instead, they came in gangs, baring their teeth in wide grins. They thought the humans would be threatened. Darmin lifted his rifle and shot into the air, and they scattered.

But the animals were too stupid to stay away. They came back again. People had started digging up the earth and, slowly but surely, the hills had been flattened and new valleys had been created. For months now the revving of engines had replaced the rushing of wind and the splashing of water, and bright work lights glared all night long.

The monkeys were disturbed, and it seemed as though they had to disturb the humans in return. It had reached new heights a few weeks ago: a child in the Unit XII settlement had fought with a monkey over a bag of peanuts until another monkey came and the pair attacked him. The child suffered bites on his cheek and arm. The company sent the kid to the hospital. There were no signs of rabies, but the incident had aggravated the workers who lived in the bunkhouses. As time passed, the monkeys kept growing bolder. Then a foreman was riding his motorcycle when a monkey suddenly attacked from above, leaping down onto him from a branch. The bite wasn’t bad, but the man lost control of the bike, was thrown into a ditch, and broke his arm. A truck driver sleeping in his cabin was attacked too. Deep scratches across his face left him scarred, and partially blind from a ruptured eyeball.

That was when they called the forest police and filed a report with the local military headquarters. Neither the police nor the military took them seriously. Instead they said, ‘You guys can take care of this monkey business yourselves.’

 

More than twenty years ago, Darmin had lived in a settlement on the edge of a teak forest that belonged to the government. He didn’t do much back then. He would cut down teak in secret and sell the poached timber to a middleman. If the forest police caught him, he would have to split the profits – later he also shared them with a soldier from the military office. He lived alone. Five years earlier, his wife had died giving birth to their child, who didn’t survive either.

One day there was a commotion. People were angry with the old witch doctor. He knew the guy lived in the neighboring forest. Villagers with strange ailments would go visit him, as would folks wanting other kinds of things – to have a child, to make someone suffer. Darmin had never really thought about him one way or another until that day, when the extent of his crimes was revealed.

The witch doctor didn’t just heal all kinds of illness. He also used magic, and many had died at his hand – at least, that’s what people believed. He was long rumored to be lecherous, but when word got out that he’d robbed a local girl of her virtue, the people’s anger erupted. A throng had gathered outside his house, armed with machetes and spears, but no one dared actually go inside and grab him.

Darmin heard all this. He knew the girl they were talking about. He would often pass her in the mornings, when she was on her way to school, and she would always greet him, ‘Good morning, Uncle.’ He was in fact no relation to her, but her warmth always made him imagine what his child might have been like if she’d lived. The thought of the witch doctor taking her honor made his chest feel hot. Without saying much, he charged toward the man’s house.

There he saw faces full of rage, which he recognized, and fear, which disgusted him. Were they afraid of the man’s power? That’s bullshit, he thought. He didn’t believe in magic or witchcraft. He grabbed a machete out of someone’s hand, kicked down the door and strode into the house.

Once inside he saw the man right there, peering out through a crack in the window. His wife was huddled over, crying into her hands. The witch doctor turned in surprise. When he met Darmin’s gaze, his eyes were pleading.

Darmin walked toward him, the machete raised high in his clenched fist. The witch doctor cupped his hands together at his chest, begging for mercy, but Darmin didn’t feel compelled to show any. His fist flew down. A powerful swing from a hand accustomed to wielding an axe that chopped down teak trees. The blade struck the witch doctor’s neck. Blood gushed. His head sagged. When she realized what was happening, the wife let out a piercing scream. With one more slash the witch doctor’s head was severed from its body. Darmin carried the head out into the yard by its hair, then threw it to the ground.

The police arrested Darmin. For weeks, in jail, he kept asking himself: What have I done? Why did I kill him? Where did I get the nerve? He shuddered to remember it. Someone from the local military office came to visit him, to comfort him. The soldier said the villagers had finally mustered up some courage. They had slit the throats of a dozen other witch doctors. He didn’t know exactly how many, but people were talking about it. He was surprised there were that many in the village.

‘The newspapers will all write about it for a few months, but those guys will still be dead,’ the soldier said. ‘And they deserve to be dead.’ The judge sentenced him to seven years, but he was only in jail for three months and a few days. One day the warden brought him to the exit door and whispered, ‘You can go.’ Darmin returned to his house and the villagers treated him with great respect. He didn’t need to steal teak anymore, the villagers did it for him. Logs piled up behind his house. A middleman came with a guarded truck and hauled the timber away. For years, until the villagers’ respect wore thin, he didn’t need to do a thing.

 

The next day a monkey came to the mining site and bit an excavator operator, leaving a gaping wound in his neck. The doctor had to transport him to the hospital, praying he didn’t die on the way.

‘What a bother,’ Darmin thought. He’d started to miss those boring days when he hadn’t had to do anything.

Now he was responsible for worksite safety. The company did get some help from the army and the local youth organizations, but he was the one who had to travel from the bunkhouses into the teak forests every day, ensuring everything was all right. Sometimes an environmental group came on behalf of the river, which was badly polluted, or the hill that had been blasted away and collapsed, or most often on behalf of the people, who were poor. There might be some commotion then, but – though it wasn’t easy – you could still talk it out, you could still reason with them. And if words didn’t work, money usually did.

Unfortunately, you can’t reason with a monkey.

‘You have to kill at least one of them,’ said Agus Maulana, a fellow worker who was always neatly dressed. ‘And that’ll be a sign to the others.’

‘No,’ said Darmin. ‘We just need to keep chasing them all away.’

It still bothered him, the thought of how he’d killed that witch doctor. He didn’t understand how he could have done it. When he was in prison he’d vowed he would never hurt anyone again, and not just another human being. He’d told the people in the office too – he was willing to stand guard, but he wasn’t going to kill the monkeys.

He’d handed out some air rifles, just in case, but warned the workers not to shoot at the animals. They should only shoot into the sky. That way the monkeys would be scared away, and no one would get shot accidentally. But the incident with the excavator operator had proved that at least one of the monkeys was no longer afraid of the sound.

Darmin finally went into the forest. Agus Maulana went with him.

‘I still say it would be good to kill just one, before they kill one of us.’

‘There’s no way a monkey could kill a human,’ Darmin said. ‘Anyway, we’ll wind up on the news if we start killing monkeys.’

‘No we won’t,’ laughed Agus Maulana. ‘No one would know.’

‘Aren’t the monkeys protected? I’ve never seen monkeys like this in my village.’

‘What the hell does it matter, brother!’ said Agus Maulana. ‘In this country, people are so easily killed – hundreds of thousands of people have been shot to death, maybe more. What’s so bad about killing a few monkeys?’

Darmin still didn’t believe the problem could be solved that way. Humans had choices. They could choose to dig up the land, raze the forest, send their filth into the rivers and the oceans. It didn’t matter why. For progress. For the millions of stomachs that had to be filled up with food. They could also choose to leave nature as it was. Monkeys didn’t have a choice. They lived where they lived.

Darmin had always been able to scatter the monkeys. They would hear his warning shot, get scared, scream, and run away. But they wouldn’t disappear forever. They would change their routine temporarily, be gone for a day or two, then suddenly reappear to attack another worker.

There was one hillside still filled with towering trees. Over its peak was another bare expanse, primed for excavation. So it was likely the monkeys were there, on that hillside.

Behind his glasses, Agus Maulana’s eyes scanned the foliage. He turned to one side and then another. Darmin thought the youth wasn’t really suited for life in the jungle, nor a bunkhouse, nor an excavation site. His slight build was made for walking down a city sidewalk, carrying a briefcase. Even so, Agus Maulana seemed to enjoy the opportunity for adventure.

‘There’s a group of them, brother,’ Agus Maulana called out.

Darmin had seen them too. They were clustered in a tree, filling its branches, staring back at them. Sensing a threat, they were starting to shriek and grin, displaying sharp canines. Darmin lifted his rifle and shot up into the air. The monkeys were startled, and as they started to move, the tree began swaying violently. They jumped to the branches of another tree, which started to rustle and shake as they landed, then settled in a third.

Darmin chased after the monkeys, again aiming his rifle up at the empty air. He pulled the trigger, a shot rang out. The monkeys again went swinging and leaping farther away. Their chaotic screams were answered with more, from somewhere in the distance.

Darmin chased the monkeys as far away as he could. In between the excavation sites, there was a kind of corridor of trees that stretched out far as the eye could see. Darmin wondered if they could lead the monkeys all the way down that corridor, chase them back to a part of the jungle that remained untouched.

 

There was another thing Darmin regretted: punching an old man in the face – a really old guy, in his eighties. He did what people told him to do. He was a machine.

The old man had been the last holdout. He’d refused to sell his fields, which were right in the middle of where the reservoir was supposed to be. They were building a dam. They’d tried all the different ways to convince him to go, including offering him twice as much money than the other landowners had gotten. He didn’t care about the money.

Someone high up in the company had thrown up his hands and suggested the man should simply be killed. Darmin wasn’t sure why they thought he should be the one to do it. When they asked him about it, Darmin cursed them. No, he would never kill anyone ever again. They didn’t try to force him, especially not after the man was interviewed on television. They just ordered Darmin to find some other way to take care of it. Frustrated, and out of ideas, Darmin had finally walked up to the old guy and punched him in the face.

Word was his jaw was fractured. Darmin was embarrassed – not of what he’d done, but that it didn’t even solve the problem. For a few days they’d been targeted by the media. Twice Darmin had to go to the police station.

Agus Maulana came to help. He tracked the old man down after he was discharged from the hospital, and he brought a kyai with him. The kyai spoke to the old man.

‘What did he say?’ Darmin asked, weeks after the fields had been surrendered and submerged.

Agus Maulana chuckled. ‘The kyai said this life is nothing but a game. A diversion. Eternal life comes in the hereafter, so why get so caught up in the concerns of this mortal world?’

After that they had often worked together, at different places. A few years ago, the man who got him out of prison had connected them with the company. They dug coal mines in two districts, and nickel at the last place. Moving from project to project he had seen men paving wide roads, building long bridges that connected two islands, constructing underground trains, ports, airfields. He might never have seen any of it if he’d kept leading his old life at the edge of the teak forest.

 

‘Fuck!’ It was the first time Darmin had ever heard Agus Maulana swear.

‘Fucking dog! Devil! Bastard!’

Wati, a young woman from the office in the city, had come to the mine for the monthly audit. She’d spent the night in a bunkhouse with two coworkers and that was her last night on this earth. The monkeys had attacked as they slept. The three women were set upon by dozens of them. Two suffered scratches and bites, but Wati ran out of the house screaming. The monkeys chased her. They caught her, scratched and bit. They clung to her arms and her clothes. As the girl was running, staggering and swaying, one monkey clambered up onto her face and grabbed a fistful of her hair. She slipped and went sliding down a steep slope. She fell forward and her stomach was impaled on a sharp rock.

Agus Maulana had been fond of her. Apparently the feeling was mutual. Darmin had seen them eating in the work canteen together, gazing into each other’s eyes. Secretly he’d hoped that the two would be happy together. He understood why the young man was swearing. He understood when Agus Maulana snatched up a rifle and rushed toward the forest. Darmin took his own rifle, and his bullets, and hurried after.

Darmin heard Agus Maulana’s shots. When he approached, the youth was shooting blindly into the trees. There was a troop of monkeys in the branches and they scattered in a cacophony of shouts. Darmin realized the young man was a terrible shot. Not even one bullet had landed.

‘I’ll kill you all! You dogs, you pigs, you fucks!’

The young man didn’t look at Darmin, just kept pacing. Every time he saw the foliage move, he would lift his rifle and shoot. Sometimes it was just a squirrel, or a bird. He didn’t care. If he saw a monkey, his eyes would flash and he’d start shooting wildly again. Again and again. But not even one bullet met its mark. The young man threw himself down into the grass and sobbed.

‘You’re useless, brother,’ he murmured through his sobs. ‘You hold a rifle, and you can shoot, but you don’t even have the guts to kill a monkey.’

 

The next morning, as Wati’s corpse was being loaded into the car that would take it back to the city, Darmin went out on his motorcycle, a rifle at his back. He rode slowly, away from the main road, following a small footpath into the forest.

‘You’re useless, brother.’

The words seemed to echo through the forest, bouncing off the cliff walls and reflecting off the surface of every leaf. He stopped riding only when the path came to a sudden end. He dismounted and left the motorbike lying there in the grass. He continued on foot, pushing through the brush. He could faintly hear monkeys yelling and chattering. He walked toward the sounds.

Soon he saw them. Did it really have to be this way? Did they really have to die for some lumpy mounds of dirt that had been dredged up from the bowels of the earth?

‘You’re useless.’ Again the words echoed. ‘You don’t even have the guts to kill a monkey, brother.’

He watched the monkey troop closely. He took note of the biggest, who was also the slowest. The animals seemed to become aware of his presence. They started yelling louder, screaming, baring their teeth. Darmin raised his rifle. He pointed it at the big monkey, which he took for the alpha, their chief. He aimed for the head.

‘Shoot, brother!’

He heard himself exhale, then retrained his eyes on the biggest monkey and realized: the monkey was pregnant. They looked at each other. The monkey scratched its stomach, as if to make sure the little monkey inside its body was all right. Darmin’s finger began to tremble.

His vision blurred. The monkey let out a strangled cry and went flying. Darmin could hear its body crashing down through the thicket, landing on the dirt with a thump. Seeing the dead body, its head exploded, the other monkeys took flight in earnest. Their screams were no longer threats, but were filled now with powerlessness and fear.

Darmin turned, his rifle still raised, and followed them, shivering. The whole time he saw nothing. His entire body had gone cold except his head, which was smoldering.

 

That day Darmin killed nineteen monkeys and strung them all up from the branches.

But that didn’t keep the monkeys away. At night, they came to the bunkhouses, and kept everyone awake with their screams. A few of them pissed on the shutters. Their numbers seemed to grow.

Darmin killed more of them. A dozen. This time he skinned them and strung their corpses up by their ankles.

The next day a worker who forgot to lock his window was attacked by a pair of them in the middle of the night. His face was badly gouged out, and one of his ears ripped clean off.

Darmin shot twenty-three more monkeys. He chopped off their heads, then impaled each on the tip of a spear. Then he lined the spears up along the edge of the forest.

The monkey army kept coming.

After a while Darmin stopped counting. Every week the company delivered more bullets with the provisions.

A month or two later Agus Maulana came out of mourning. He asked Darmin, ‘Brother, is all this really necessary?’

‘It’s annoying, brother,’ Darmin told him. ‘But it’s my job.’"

    "text": "The first time we came home blowing into used condoms, excitedly wondering where the hell that balloon variant – endlessly stretchy and transparent – had been all our lives, Mother, who was out in the kitchen negotiating with the fire, her Caribbean skirt swaying with the smoke, leapfrogged the oaken barrier and pulled them from our lips. One by one, she washed out our mouths with soap and instructed us to brush our teeth. She then asked after the origin of those balloons.

‘Fatima,’ declared my six-year-old sister Amoo, between spitting. I elaborated that we’d gotten the balloons from Fatima’s backyard. Fatima was the young woman who had moved into the house Mr Okapo had vacated.

‘Stay away from this Fatima,’ Mother said, my insistence on a reason being met with a frigid stare that froze me over. The second time it happened, us sauntering into the compound with those transparent balloons between our lips, Mother abandoned her laundry and charged towards me screaming stupid boy, knocking me onto the ground with her forearm. It had only been three days.

‘I told you what, stupid boy?’

‘Mother, they’re just balloons,’ I argued, crawling away from her.

‘Oh, yeah? If you like balloons so much, why don’t you buy your own?’

‘Because we –’

‘Get up. Right now.’

I scrambled to my feet, dusting my khaki shorts.

‘Take me to that whore. Lead the way,’ said Mother, turning to fetch her slippers.

‘Who?’ I asked.

‘The balloons, who gives them to you? What’s her name? Faridah?’

‘Fatima. But we just picked them from –’

‘Yes, start moving.’

Fatima shared a compound with four other tenants; five terraced two-room houses within a walled enclosure, the red gate a little too close to the road. Outside, Mother yelled ‘Faridah’ while hammering on the gate with her clenched fist. Tugging at her sleeve, I whispered, ‘Fatima’. She ignored me and carried on yelling Faridah. When Faridah didn’t show, she stuck her left arm through the hole in the gate door and let herself in.

‘Are you coming or what?’

I shuffled in after her. The occupants of three of the five houses were standing on their porches, beholding a mad woman and her ten-year-old son.

‘Faridah is who of you?’

 

For a whole week, Amoo and I steered clear of the red-bricked walls that housed Fatima and her compound. And then it started to seem like we’d forget her. On Saturday, Father made a stately appearance. He would, whenever he was home, have me read to him from the newspapers that were always to be found in the glove compartment of his Subaru. Ten articles I’d read, then we’d go over the new words and fill the crossword. Always something in there for you to learn, he’d say. When I finished reading to him and skimmed the sports section and saw nothing on Ronaldo, I requested money to repair my shoes.

‘What shoes?’

‘My school shoes.’

‘Has school started?’

‘No, it’s starting the other week, on Monday.’

‘Which class are you, again?’

‘Primary Four.’

My shoes weren’t torn but I needed some money. Mother never gave us any. The first thing I thought to buy were Jahlia’s pancakes. Jahlia was the last shopkeeper in the row of metallic canteens at the upper end of the street. As I was leaving her canteen, I suddenly thought of those transparent balloons. Jahlia must’ve had the entire chromatic spectrum, but none of those balloons devoid of colour. By the day’s end, I had established that it was the same with every other merchant. So I figured those balloons must’ve been so popular they had run out of stock. For good reason, though; beyond being stretchy and transparent, they didn’t even burst on contact with grass.

I sneaked into Fatima’s gate that evening. She was surprised to see me. I said Mother was out of town. I asked her about the balloons.

‘Oh, those? They’re very rare. You’d have to go all the way to Kenya.’

She was busy sorting through the braids on her head, feet up on the wall. I couldn’t stay long. As I was passing by her DVD rack, my left foot kicked something and I heard the clinking of coins. There were maybe twenty coins spilled onto the tiled floor. Fatima saw me staring ravenously at them and said I could take them home.

‘You’re serious?’

‘Yeah, why not?’

‘Aren’t they your savings?’

She laughed at me. My pockets were bulging with metal that evening. As I stepped down from the couch in the living room, everybody heard the clinking of coins.

‘Some money,’ said Amoo.

‘I don’t have.’

‘Why are you selfish? Give your sister a coin, you won’t die,’ said Mother.

I dug into my right pocket, feeling around for a two-hundred-shilling coin. I switched to the left pocket. Mother squinted at me.

‘You have how much?’

‘I – I don’t know.’

‘You don’t know? Come and I see.’

She felt my pockets and looked up at me in disbelief.

‘This money, who gave it to you?’

In three minutes, Mother, Amoo, my elder sister Halima and I were inside the red-bricked fence.

‘Stop giving my child money,’ Mother yelled at Fatima. ‘What do you want from my son? Why don’t you go back where you came from? Give birth to your own children, you polytechnic whore.’

‘I’d rather be a polytechnic whore than an illiterate jobless saint,’ Fatima stated, matter-of-factly.

‘What? What did you say to me?’

‘You heard me. I said you’re illiterate and jobless. Are you going to deny it?’

A silence fell over the compound. The other tenants were witnessing. Mother jeered, looked around, then jeered again. She instructed Halima to take Amoo and I home. A quarter of an hour later, she joined us. The sandal from her right foot was missing, and her lesu was muddied.

‘Halima, go fetch my sandal from that whore’s porch. The two of you, what I’ll do to you heaven only knows should you ever go inside that fence again,’ Mother said.

 

‘Mother, is it true that you’re illiterate?’ Amoo suddenly asked at dinner.

Halima stared at our little sister, as though prompting her to take the words back. I stared into my own plate.

‘No, it’s not,’ responded Mother, three forks later.

‘Okay, so Fatima was lying, right?’ Amoo added.

‘You believe that foolish colonised head of hers?’ Mother countered.

She was looking at all three of us, one after the other. Halima rose to go to the kitchen.

‘Who else wants water?’ she called out over her shoulder.

‘Me, me, me!’ Amoo exclaimed.

We spent most of the rest of dinner in silence. I didn’t know what, but something had shrunk inside of Mother. I’d never seen her like that. And then it started falling into place, everything. She had never, ever helped us with our homework, Amoo and I. She always delegated the role to Halima, so we’d learned not to ask. Halima was in secondary school, leagues above us and she wasn’t always in the mood to concern herself with trivialities. Mood aside, she had studied the old curriculum, and claimed she knew nothing about the new. But my sister always had the answers if there was something in it for her, like if she needed her shoes polished. And you couldn’t keep homework that was due the next morning for a father that came home on select Saturdays. Lying in my bed – the top bunk above Amoo’s – that night, it also dawned on me that I’d never heard Mother speaking English, not even at the parent-teacher meetings.

The next day, Sunday, Mother asked me to do something I hadn’t done in a while.

‘Musa?’ she called, standing in my bedroom doorway.

‘Yes, Mother?’

‘How’re you doing?’

She was smiling at me.

‘I’m fine, why?’

‘Eh, can’t a mother ask after her son’s well-being in peace?’

‘Yes, she can.’

‘Anyway, I need your help.’

I sat up on the bed.

‘Do you have some nails?’

She was leaning sheepishly against the doorframe now.

‘No, but maybe I can get some. Why?’

‘Take this knife.’

She drew a small knife from around her waist.

‘You want me to puncture Father’s tyre?’

‘No, not one tyre. Two tyres.’

‘Why, Mother?’

‘I’ll get you some money this coming week.’

I looked away from her, pretending I didn’t care about the money.

‘Okay, but what has he done this time?’

‘It’s none of your business.’

‘How much money will I get, though?’

‘Oh God, you boy. Who taught you the ways of a merchant? You don’t trust your mother?’

‘All right. So, I’m doing it now?’

‘Yeah, please do it now. Two tyres of your choice. But he can’t find out, Musa. You know I’ll kill you.’

‘Okay, Mother.’

I didn’t have any current issues with Father, so puncturing his car tyres felt traitorous. Doing so always stalled him long enough for Mother to resolve whatever issues she’d have with him. He’d get into the car to leave and he’d instantly notice the flat tyre, and Sundays were no time to catch a mechanic on their job, so that usually bought us an extra night – Sunday night. Two hissing tyres and a buried knife later, I prayed to God to convince Mother to pay me my money. For many previous debts, she had ended up reminding me that I was getting all my meals for free.

When Mother drove off with Father on Monday morning, she came back in the afternoon and declared that she had got herself a job. I suspected that it had everything to do with the punctured tyres. Sunday night must’ve been all the time she had needed to negotiate herself out of housewifery. I felt good about it, that I had been of immense utility. What the job meant was that she couldn’t stay home all day every day anymore. A thousand warnings were issued and we were reminded of our playing boundaries: Fatima’s gate to the North, Makumbi’s dogs roaming his farmland to the East and Jjaja Reagan’s watchful eyes from her porch – a position that she never seemed to leave – to the South.

 

The new school term meant that the boys and I could finally resume playing football after classes. We played in our uniforms or shirtless. We’d get home late to grumbling siblings and belligerent mothers, but it was a fair price to pay to keep the dream alive. It was the universal dream. Cristiano Ronaldo earned more money in one week than the best engineer or lawyer did in one year. The boys knew that and I knew it, too. If we could play for Manchester United someday, we could retire our mothers immediately. We could drop out of school, and then maybe buy the school and turn it into a poultry farm. The boys envisaged that and I did, too. I had a few other reasons as well, the kind you don’t pass along to the boys over lunch. If I became a professional footballer, I’d have enough money to get my teeth fitted with braces. My overbite was noticeable to everybody but my parents.

Sloping down to the football field on the first afternoon, the boys ahead of me were stopping in their tracks, one by one. And then I saw it; yellow-stripped saloon cars, road signs, demarcated lanes, adults dressed for any occasion but sport. The greedy school administration had leased the football field to a driving school. The headmistress, she said of the matter the next day that it was temporary and that our patience would be appreciated. Nobody had it in them to ask the million-dollar question: how temporary? Still, we played the beautiful game. Once owners of the place, now we encroached on the edge of the field. We used bricks for goalposts and made smaller teams of five, playing ten-minute matches in rotation. Whenever the ball strayed into a vehicle’s path, it would take the rest of the afternoon to retrieve it; our new landlords were the sort to be pleaded with. We were driven off often, told to go play elsewhere, but we had no elsewhere to go. When we started washing their cars for free just so we could examine their interiors, the driving school people said, hey, why not share the field, it’s a win-win. By the third week of the school term, we had swapped our bricks for traffic cones and stray footballs were being returned immediately. The flanks of the field had become our territory and we had gotten an unlikely audience; adults. Who knew who might’ve been watching as you pulled off the Jay-Jay Okocha turn?

It was a harmonious arrangement. Then one Thursday, Pinto, a boy from the class below me, was napping in the shadow cast by one of the cars. Some old lady – a student of the driving school, no doubt – mustn’t have seen him there, or maybe she mistook the reverse gear for the forward one, because she ran over his legs. My team was on the sidelines when we heard the screaming. We rushed to the scene at once. There sat a dazed Pinto, clutching the underside of his limp legs, the pale yellowish-white of his fragmented femur sharply contrasting with the crimson of blood, a steady stream of which was flowing over his trembling fingers and into the grass. For weeks, I didn’t sleep too well. Mother took notice, but I wasn’t talking to her, not until she paid me my money for puncturing Father’s tyres. The boys were all devastated by Pinto’s misfortune, because how early in a life to retire from football, and how gruesome a manner in which to do it. He didn’t come back to school, and the headmistress banned us from playing football on the field ever again.

 

With little to do besides playing cards with Amoo after school, I soon turned my face to the forbidden North. Halima wasn’t in any way an approximation of a worthy vicegerent of Mother’s. Late afternoons, I’d sneak off into the red-bricked fence. In a handful of days, I’d established that Fatima was the queen of loose change. One afternoon, while lying down on her living room floor doing my homework, I asked her to help me spell ‘photosynthesis’. She recited it like it was the Lord’s Prayer. I was exhilarated. I asked her something else, and then something else. Many subsequent afternoons included the questionnaire session, and I loved the instantaneous answers.

Two weeks of washing Fatima’s utensils bought me my first proper football. It was a supermarket ball, a Jabulani replica, but I needed another two weeks to figure that out. Most of the boys from school lived far away from me, so I had to settle for playing with Reagan, the neighbourhood boy whose face was streamlined like a lizard’s. When the football got punctured and I took it to the cobbler two streets from us to have it sewed, he asked if it belonged to me.

‘Yes, it does,’ I said, handing him a five-hundred-shilling coin.

‘You love the game, son?’

‘Yeah.’

‘Well, there’s this free academy that opened up recently.’

‘Where?’

‘At the municipality. Right around that corner from Barclays.’

‘Okay. It’s really free?’

‘Yeah, just your parent’s consent and a pair of shoes.’

I stared into the distance, holding my waist.

‘What? Tough parents?’ he asked.

‘No.’

‘Shoes? I can patch you a pair . . .’

I shook my head, turning to leave. The entire trek home I spent thinking about the free football academy. I had school, so Mother would never agree to it. The shoes, I could always find the shoes. But my mother, the woman would never say yes. And with that, I was in the market for a consenting parent.

‘And your mother?’ Fatima asked me, when I requested that she enrol me to the academy.

‘Of course she’ll say no.’

‘Why?’

‘She thinks school is everything.’

‘Maybe she’s right.’

‘But she didn’t even go to school.’

‘Don’t talk like that about your mother.’

‘But you’re the one that said so. You said she was illiterate.’

‘It’s because she insulted me first. I didn’t mean it at all.’

‘You’re lying.’

‘I’m not.’

It took some pestering for Fatima to enrol me in the football academy. They were very polished, the boys there. They had municipal attitudes: clean, restrained, sophisticated. And some of them were older: twelve, thirteen, fifteen even. I sat out the first two practice sessions because I didn’t have shoes. When the cobbler saw me coming his way, he wiped his forehead and stood up to greet me, like we were agemates, like I was an old friend. He presented me with a pair three sizes too big.

‘The owner hasn’t picked them in weeks,’ he said. ‘In fact, the boy goes to some boarding school whose name I forget. You can stuff the front with toilet tissue, though I think wearing two pairs of socks could do as well,’ he said.

‘I don’t have money, what should we do?’ I asked.

He looked me in the eyes, his facial features tightening.

‘Can you exchange them for my football?’

He squinted, weighing in.

‘It’s a Jabulani. Father came with it from –’

‘Son, I know. I know Jabulanis.’

We stood there facing each other, him sizing me up, and me taking in his unkempt white beard, wondering how old he must’ve been.

‘All right, son. I’ll just fit in new laces for you, eh?’

I ran home to fetch the football.

 

The training sessions were intense. It had been communicated that there were championships coming up. I’d joined late, so I needed to earn my place on the team. I was seeing very little of Mother and Halima and Amoo. I’d leave school at four o’clock and jog the kilometre to the academy. Anything to keep the dream alive. Nabongho, the thirteen-year-old boy with effortless dribbles, was selected to be the captain.

‘What number do you play?’ he asked me after a shooting session.

‘Ronaldo’s number.’

‘What number does Ronaldo play?’

‘In front.’

Nabongho burst into laughter.

‘He plays seven. Right-winger.’

‘Yeah, seven. That’s what I meant,’ I said. He looked down at my shoes. The boarding school boy’s shoes. I crossed one foot over the other.

‘Your left foot is better suited for the left wing, though.’

‘Yeah, maybe I could practise that.’

‘So, that woman you come with sometimes, she’s your sister or mother?’

He meant Fatima. I was no longer washing her utensils or mopping her house for money. Now she mostly paid me in correct answers and accompaniment to the academy. She wore fancy clothes and smelled exotic, and I realised that I liked to be seen with her in public. She would stand on the sidelines with Coach during the training sessions and they’d get so lost in conversation that the man, who often doubled as the referee, would forget to officiate. One day I heard Coach’s gravelly voice in Fatima’s living room as I took off my shoes to step onto her porch. So, I put my shoes back on and waited outside the gate like Fatima had told me to whenever she’d have a visitor. I waited like I had when it was Dan, like I had when it was Hassan, waited like I had when it was the electrician. She hadn’t told me to wait when it was Sumaiyah. Coach eventually stumbled out of the gate and walked up the road. He didn’t seem to have seen me.

‘Bye, Coach,’ I hollered, standing up.

He turned around.

‘Oh, bye,’ he managed, recognising me.

 

It was a little over a week to the championships when I made the first team. For that week, the last week of training, Coach said our presence would be required morning to evening. He said he understood that most of us had school, so he was going to need written consent from our parents. And so I was in the market yet again for a consenting parent. Permission for a week’s absence from school in the name of football wasn’t something I could ask of Mother, not unless I wanted to be punched. She might’ve been preoccupied with her new job now, but she was still very much a welterweight, and I was a feather at best. Father came home but I didn’t seek his consent, either. He always referred matters back to Mother. Fatima, she gave a firm no, said she wouldn’t be a willing accomplice in my truancy. I kept insisting, and then for the first time, she became angry.

‘You should go back home, why are you always bothering me?’ she yelled. ‘Shut the door behind you,’ she said, as I stepped out into the sunlight. I felt a lump forming in my throat and my eyes had watered by the time I was out on the street. She was right, Mother. Fatima was nothing but a selfish polytechnic whore. I swore to myself never to go to her place again.

On Monday, I wore my jersey underneath the school uniform. A safe distance from the prying eyes of my home street, I took off the uniform and stuffed it in my school bag. Coach was late, as always. He lined us up like we were scouts at a parade.

‘Where’s the written consent, boys?’ he asked. Of the seven boys he got to before me, two had to step out of the row. I bowed my head when he stepped up to me, his pot belly nudging my chest. The memory of Pinto clutching his limp legs filled my head. Coach reached for my chin, cranking my neck upright.

‘How is Fatima?’

‘Sh – she’s fine,’ I responded, taken aback.

‘That’s good, that’s good. You’ll send her my regards. You’ll tell her to reconsider.’

‘Reconsider what?’ I was almost whispering.

‘Oh, no, you just tell her that, she’ll understand, will you?’

I nodded spiritedly. And just like that, Coach moved on to Savio.

They were rigorous, the first four days. We kept training even as it poured down on Wednesday. I was swimming in my shoes because the paper I’d stuffed at the front to lodge my feet in place was soaked and had disintegrated. I cursed the cobbler. Thursday afternoon, Coach selected the starting team, assigning me the left wing. In the end, it hadn’t mattered that half the boys hadn’t gotten their parents’ consent; all sixteen of us were expected to feature on Friday. I was beaming the whole way home. Marching past the red gate, I came to a halt. I’d barely thought about Fatima that week.

‘Fatima, we’re playing the championships tomorrow.’

‘Oh, yeah? That’s nice. Where?’

‘The playground at Fairland High. You know that school –’

‘Yeah, I know it,’ she said, yawning.

‘Will you please come and watch me?’

‘Hmm . . . Are you even studying?’

‘Yeah, of course.’

‘Are you sure?’

‘Yeah.’

‘So, nowadays you do the homework all by yourself?’

‘Y – Yeah.’

It gave me away, the hesitation. Fatima sat upright.

‘Musa, I can’t come, you already know that.’

‘Why can’t you come? What if I wash your utensils the whole of next week?’

She scoffed.

‘I can’t –’

‘If you don’t come, then who will I play for?’

‘You’ve been playing for me? What about your friends?’

‘Those boys, we’re just teammates. Don’t you know you’re my only friend?’

She turned to look at me, and then back at her phone.

‘So, you’re coming, right?’

‘No, I’m sorry.’

For minutes, I said nothing.

‘By the way, Coach said you should reconsider.’

‘Reconsider what?’

‘I don’t know. He said you would understand.’

 

And then came Friday. Rising Stars played Onduparaka Under 13s in the first match of the championships. The winner of that game would then play the winner of our game for the final. It was chilly outside, as though all the world’s wind had conspired to be in attendance. The football field, it was a heatmap of green and brown patches. Halfway through the first half, somebody tickled my ribs from the row behind and I looked back to see Fatima. She was smiling at me, lip gloss reflecting the green and brown turf. I shifted to the seat next to her.

‘Are you ready?’ she asked.

‘You said you weren’t coming,’ I replied.

‘Aren’t you happy to see me?’

‘Of course I am,’ I admitted, smiling, radiating a newfound enthusiasm. With her watching, I reckoned I had everything to play for. Our match was against Yanga FC. The coin was tossed and we got the shirts, so Yanga FC played shirtless. One of their centre-backs had prominent ribs that on first glance made him vulnerable but that on contact deemed him invincible; it was a taut rib cage that felt like a breastplate against my shoulder. Both sides meant business and neither managed to score by fulltime. Savio took the first penalty and shot wide, but Nabongho salvaged us. I scored my penalty and ran to the touchline. I looked over to the bleachers where Fatima was seated. Her head was bowed, she must’ve been using her phone. I screamed her name, waving. She waved back. We had won 4:3 and were to face Rising Stars in the final.

Rising Stars, they were an ebbing tide that rocked our boat left and right. What those boys lacked in the way of sportsmanship, they more than made up for in their organisation. They communicated way better than we did. Barely ten minutes into the game, the referee suddenly blew the whistle. I looked over at him, like everybody else. He was pointing right at me and then signalling to the touchline, to Coach. And then I saw her, Mother. She was facing Coach, gesticulating furiously at him. He was trying to contain her, occasionally looking my way. I was transfixed. The referee reached me and uttered some words I couldn’t quite make out. At the touchline, fans were clustering around Coach and Mother.

‘Do you know her?’ Coach asked me, shielding me.

‘What do you mean does he know me? He’s my son!’ yelled Mother.

She was flailing her arms, making to pounce on me but Coach wrestled her back. The game had stopped. My ears, they were burning.

‘Madam, please relax,’ Coach was urging Mother.

‘Is he your son?’ she kept asking. ‘He should be in school, that stupid boy,’ she yelled. The referee came to help and the last of the players deserted the field.

‘Musa?’

Coach sounded like he was a kilometre away. I didn’t move an inch. I thought a good number of bodies were concealing me, but he just had to wade past four or five to get to me. Mother was with him, this time standing straight, her hands hanging freely on her sides, chest heaving.

‘Musa?’ she called.

‘Yes?’

‘Musa?’

‘Yes?’

‘Is that how you reply? Why are you not in school?’

I was gazing at her feet, bare on the grass, her toes dancing in a show of restraint.

‘Musa, your teacher says you’ve been absent from school this whole week. Is that true?’

‘Respond to your mother!’ somebody interjected from the crowd.

‘Musa, is it true?’

Mother was misty-eyed, lips quivering.

‘Who did you come with?’ she sobbed, stepping forward and grabbing my collar.

Coach tried to hold her back but Mother brushed him off. She yanked me forward and backward, and I grabbed her forearm to steady myself.

‘Who did you come with? Is it that whore Fatima? Answer me!’

‘Respond to your mother!’

She was dragging me out of the cocoon, bumping into bodies like they were invisible.

‘Who did you come with?’

She tightened her grip on my shirt, constricting my airway. Even with my gaze lowered, I could feel the number of eyeballs perforating me.

‘I’m so tired –’

‘I came with Fatima.’

I looked Mother straight in the face, for the first time. She nodded continuously, sighed, then let go of my shirt. I glanced in Fatima’s direction, and was surprised to see her still sitting there, oblivious. The glance lasted a split-second, but it was all the time Mother needed to locate Fatima. She turned and walked briskly in her direction. Perhaps Coach intervened, perhaps Mother stayed her hand; I didn’t stick around for any of it. All I did see was Fatima looking up from her phone, the black shadow of my mother enveloping her. I ran the whole way home, cold wind inflaming my eyes.

 

The next morning, Saturday morning, I sneaked off into the red gate, against my better judgement. I carried with me a heartfelt apology. Fatima’s front door was wide open. Her house was emptied of everything but her scent, that redolent polytechnic scent.

‘Do you know where Fatima moved to?’ I asked Mama Bbosa, the immediate neighbour.

‘Why the hell would I care?’ she asked. ‘She could’ve moved in with any of those men in her life, good riddance,’ she said. ‘What did you want?’ she cried after me as I rushed towards the gate, not bearing to look back. I hadn’t even told Fatima that I liked her, that I was hoping to marry her someday.

Later on, during the school holiday when I’d joined Facebook and I’d successfully gotten Ronaldo to accept my friend request and even text me back, and then discovered it was just some stupid boy with access to pixelated photographs of the footballing star because Ronaldo couldn’t possibly have spoken Luganda, I thought why not look up Fatima. But I only had a first name, and Facebook returned a thousand Fatimas, most of them white, none of them polytechnic."

    "text": "Iwent to see Dr Hamori on the recommendation of a friend who had suffered the same ailment as me. I could not get over or out of love with a man who had told me he no longer wanted a romantic relationship with me and had started to see other women. Dr Hamori’s clinic was in a well-to-do, sleepy suburb of the city of London, a narrow, tall brick Victorian end-of-terrace with a simple sign which said clinic on the door. I took a train down from Edinburgh, having booked my stay for four weeks. In our correspondence they said not to bring clothes or entertainment as these would be provided, but to pack a swimming costume if I had one.

Dr Hamori wore a colourful paisley shirt, high-waisted brown corduroy trousers and a yin-yang necklace. He was bald except for a string of braided grey hair protruding from the base of his skull. His office was on the first floor. I heard many sounds from above, screams and dancing. There were marble statues of nude women, abstract paintings and modern-looking furniture on which he told me to sit down. He pointed to the paintings, ‘These were done by former clients of mine, women who have been cured of unrequited love and can now focus on being creative and productive citizens. May I ask you some delicate questions? You said in your application it was a man you love. Did you have intercourse without protective methods? Was his penis uncircumcised and not especially clean?’

Yes, I answered.

‘Do you feel as though there was a black, poisonous liquid flowing through your body?’

Yes, exactly, I said.

‘Love is a matter of yeast,’ he said. ‘Come with me.’

 

He took me to a room upstairs. A woman lay in the bed. She was cradling a piece of dirty rope, singing to it. The floor was covered in crumpled, unused nappies and toys. ‘Love is a yeast and a psychic phenomenon in the genitals and bowels,’ Dr Hamori said. ‘The creature you see her holding is born of this yeast, and from bacteria from the beloved’s genitals, and as such feeds on fantasy, delusion and crumbs of affection. I am the only clinic that has learned how to expel this creature. We offer a heavy rota of culture and physical activity – opera, ballet, badminton, Pilates, invented by a German soldier while in prison. It is the ideal exercise for someone like you, who has become a prisoner in your own body. We often hold emotion in the bowels and a specialised diet will lead to the expulsion of these unwelcome feelings. It will take a lot of hard work on your part, not just mine. Now this expulsion is not a baby. I must make this very clear to all my patients. It is not a baby and believing it might be will bring forth a descent into madness. When you are near your expulsion, you are not allowed to leave the house. The woman you see here expelled her creature alone in the splendid toilets at the Orangery in Kew Gardens and formed an attachment to it that we cannot break, as of yet.’

I thought of scraping the residue of a yeast infection with my fingernail and smelling it. Is that love?

He showed me another resident in another room, who came rushing to her door as soon as she heard us coming close. She walked with an odd sway. I noticed, growing on one of her thighs, a giant lump, like a hernia. Her curly blonde hair was unbrushed and cut in a short, hazardous way. She had drawn rings on her fingers using blue ballpoint pens, which had smeared, and in places the ink was embedded so deeply into her skin that the lines had become cuts.

‘Has Harry been here today?’ she asked. ‘Abandon all hope ye who enter here,’ Dr Hamori said to her, and took me down to the kitchen where he made us lapsang souchong tea in an antique pot.

‘Elspeth is a particular challenge for me, because her beloved, this Harry, meaninglessly contacts her now and then,’ said Dr Hamori, taking two postcards from his pocket. ‘Hi, how are you x’ was written on the back of a picture of a Kewpie doll that was peeing and giggling. The other was a picturesque postcard from the Isle of Skye. ‘Splendid day, lovely jubbly x.’ The handwriting was childish and hurried, a thought given and quickly forgotten.

‘He is married, with children, and has no romantic interest in our Elspeth. He likes to stay in contact with her, says she is a great chum. We try our best to cut off all contact. She was near expulsion but he sent her a hamper from Fortnum & Mason that we did not catch, and she devoured it – biscuits, chocolates, champagne – hence the unsightly lump on her leg, which we have been trying to drain and forcibly expulse, though yeast remnants remain and regrow. We have a high rate of success at our clinic, but not perfect – it will take willpower from you for an expulsion.’

I signed a contract and started the expulsion regime. We ate a diet with no gluten, sugar or alcohol: potato soup, shredded carrot, unsweetened cranberry juice, tofu, high fibre, mild curry, many greens such as kale, cavolo nero, cabbage, spinach casserole, carob-based desserts, brown rice with rehydrated nori, yogurt with maple syrup, avocados, stewed and dried fruit. We drank cup after cup of nettle tea, which cleansed and detoxified us and pushed the yeast from our bodies.

We were given our own rooms. They were cleaner than any place I had ever lived in, though after a few days I learned that I would have to clean it myself, that this was part of the regimen. On the nightstand was a booklet of postcards. A nude woman having her bum slapped, a topless man wearing revealing swimming trunks, copies of Renaissance paintings, and so forth. I didn’t know what these were for until another patient, Frederick, told me they were masturbatory aids, and that the drawer below was filled with all sorts of implements. It was encouraged, he said, as orgasms were yeast-cleaning and balanced the pH levels, as long as we did not think of the people we were supposed to forget. We had communal bathrooms with signs that said not to leave anything, not a hair nor a toenail. This was strictly enforced due to one patient, Kay.

‘Once I was compelled to eat something rotten from the rubbish bin as a child for good luck and something good happened,’ she told me. ‘It’s a weird sort of witchcraft I invented, if you are brave enough to eat nasty things, you are given a reward. It’s how I found George. I ate a urinal cake at a pub then met him there later in the night. I stopped doing it when we were together, and now that he’s left me, doing it again might bring him back.’

If one of us left something half chewed on our plate or coughed up a grain of rice, she tried to eat it. If she managed to – she made repulsive faces – this wasn’t fun or pleasant for her but something she felt she had to do. Afterwards, she would impatiently wait, pacing the house, for George to come pick her up, or call the clinic, and then when there was still no word from him, she would decide that she hadn’t gone far enough.

‘Oh no no, I just haven’t eaten enough. Love is an enormous thing rather, so it will take a lot,’ she muttered.

Kay smoked a lot, and strangely this was encouraged by Dr Hamori, who left antique glass ashtrays everywhere around the house for her, since, as he saw it, nibbling on her own cigarette butts was better than pubic hairs left in the bathroom or bits of nori found in the sink after washing dishes. She was temporarily banned from outings because of this: she was found drinking the water from a toilet in the Victoria and Albert Museum and eating scone crumbs off the floor of the magnificent cafe, but we could bring her presents and sugar-free, wheat-free treats.

Our excursions were carefully planned. Dr Hamori had a map of Britain with the addresses of our exes pinned to it, along with a brief list of their interests. I was fortunate, mine was far away, up in Edinburgh, though King’s Cross Station gave me a sickly nostalgic feeling because of the north-bound trains, so we avoided the British Library.

We went to the ballet, theatre, opera, classical concerts – all matinees as our beloveds might attend in the evenings on dates. We were given vegan ice cream made from dates and coconut to distract us from these thoughts, which Dr Hamori brought to the theatre in a cold metal case. Frederick and I held each other and wept during the operas – Dr Hamori was pleased as he said this was healthy. ‘I always thought I would be the object of affection,’ said Frederick, who was tiny with strawberry-blonde hair. His fixation was an older, married MP named Wilfried, who wore ghastly ties and needed to hoist his trousers up at regular intervals when speaking to the public. I had seen photos in the newspapers and on the television, but this was forbidden knowledge. We visited all the museums, big and small, and went for walks in the glass houses of Kew Gardens to admire the ferns. We never left the house on evenings and weekends, though, as we were more prone to run into our desired ones, and instead spent them in the house, watching Ealing Studios films or playing board games. We were allowed as many library books as we wanted – we had to make a list, however. We were banned from going ourselves, as Elspeth would read the peerage encyclopedias to see if Harry had any more children, and a girl named Jeanie would find pictures of her beloved – an actress, wearing clogs on the cover of Vogue, or seated with a new girl in Tatler, just as Frederick would rip through the business pages of the Financial Times and the Telegraph.

We were brought to a salon where we all, to our despair, emerged with the same bowl cuts and French manicures; perhaps it was a bulk discount, but Dr Hamori said a new look was vital, though nothing too extreme. I agreed. In the weeks following my break-up, I had wandered around Edinburgh wearing a peculiar coral shade of lipstick and a gigantic waxed raincoat with a Rupert Bear badge pinned to the front.

We were given vintage high-waisted wool trousers to wear. Dr Hamori said these would give us a feeling of determination and independence but I was fat in the thighs, and the wool rubbing against them gave me a brittle and crusty rash. Frederick said, ‘My God, I look like Evelyn Waugh in these.’

 

We had in-house lectures too, on various topics – T.S. Eliot, medieval art, biodiversity, linguistics, and so forth. The lecturers, brought in from esteemed universities around the country, were peppery and dashing, and I realised they were chosen on account of their looks rather than their areas of expertise, so that we would develop childish crushes.

Dr Hamori gave us simple, logical lectures on love and had us take notes. We weren’t allowed to talk or ask questions as this could cause yeast build-ups in the tonsils. He told us he once had a client who came in with a white tongue from months of talking to a therapist, cured only with a vow of silence and marshmallow leaf tea. He said he found all forms of talking therapy to be Cartesian, yeast-yielding claptrap.

He told us his own history. ‘My father was the British ambassador to a distant country and we travelled widely. Once, as a child, I ate a fragrant pancake which gave me such a horrendous bout of food poisoning, I was hospitalised for a month. It changed the nature of my gut bacteria, and I grew up to be a loving, loyal man – this is unusual for someone of heterosexual persuasions. I have three daughters and dote on my wife. It is a harsh world you will be released back into, but your gut will be strong.’

Although, he admitted that some people have the opposite affliction. ‘Their admirers are tough cases, but I have cured them. What causes such an unnatural lack of love in one you would expect to be loving? Or an ability to over-love in someone you wouldn’t? I believe the culprit to be poisoning, parasites, medication used to treat an unrelated ailment, too much liquor, little to no fibre.’

I enjoyed the schoolgirlish comradery of our meals and exercises. On outings, if we passed by bakeries, the croissants and cakes looked claustrophobic and wretched and I had no appetite for them. I enjoyed the Epsom salt baths and the sauna just off the kitchen in the basement, where we sat wearing wool hats and sweating. I even looked forward to my enemas – they left me feeling renewed and light. I took to reading big Vasily Grossman novels in bed, eating carob chips, and admiring how strong my glutes had become from Pilates, which Dr Hamori taught himself, a Mahler record playing in the background as we stretched, breathed and held our balance.

 

The first upset came in the form of Harry. He came round to the clinic, wanting to give Elspeth a half-eaten piece of cake wrapped in a napkin from a wedding he had attended. Dr Hamori stood in front of the door, blocking his entrance and shouting furiously. ‘Away! Out! You cad!’

We watched from the window in a cluster, with the exception of Elspeth who had been locked in her bedroom and was pounding on the door. Harry was a middle-aged man with the shifty eyes and the floppy blonde hair of a teenager.

‘She’s a special girl,’ he said grandly to Dr Hamori. ‘A great old chum, can’t I see her?’

‘But what is your intent, will you leave your wife, your children?’ Dr Hamori said.

‘I love my wife very much, you really have a bee in your bonnet, Doctor.’

He was eventually shooed away, eating the piece of cake and humming ‘The King Is Still in London’.

 

All of us had the first pangs of sharp cramps and headaches at the same time, with the exception of Elspeth who, since Harry’s visit, had taken to kissing and chewing on the lump on her thigh until it was purple and infected. Dr Hamori had a fertility chart for those of us who menstruated and none of us were at the right time of our cycle for bleeding. A nurse tapped us here and there and looked into our orifices with a flashlight. We had to stretch open our legs against walls and our enemas were increased. While stretching, Jeanie began crying, got up and took off her trousers and knickers in front of us and expulsed what looked like a wet baseball glove that smelled like horrid breath and mouldy bread. Dr Hamori took it away immediately. I believe he burned it in the green Aga stove in his kitchen.

 

Ipanicked, against my better judgement. I didn’t want to lose him. I stuffed loo roll into my vagina, and my ears, to hold the expulsion in. I bit my tongue, kept my mouth shut, had irrational visions of my beloved on an express train from Edinburgh, the address of the clinic written on the palm of his hand. I stopped going to the bathroom and avoided my enemas. My stomach grew large and heavy and bothered with matter and urine like an overstuffed grocery bag. Dr Hamori and his nurses noticed and sent me to bed. I craved bags of flour and sweet glasses of sherry.

They had to tie my hands down to the bed so I wouldn’t press them against my ear from where the thing had begun to emerge. It looked like a long green woollen sock, like the ones my beloved wore while hunting imbecile flightless birds on large Scottish estates; the sodden folds of the wool resembled his face. I screamed as they took it away in a plastic bag, then felt a strange sort of post-coital relief. I regretted avoiding my enemas, for I soiled the bed during the process.

I was to stay at the clinic a few more weeks, to make sure the yeast was completely out of me and while I waited I observed the expulsions of my fellow patients. A nurse syringed liquid into my ears which dribbled out with bits of ear wax, cloth and other mysterious bits in it, then rubbed my ears down with almond oil. Frederick’s expulsion took the form of a horrid boil-like thing on his chest which burst. He looked poetic after, his chest bandaged up like a soldier, a cigarette between his lips as he made wistful plans for his future. ‘Upwards and onwards,’ he said to me.

Kay developed a horrible affliction of burping which could not be stopped, each louder than the last. Her expulsion was due soon. She ate nothing at all but smoked continuously. She was so near the end when George showed up, as we had all at one point dreamed of our exes showing up. One morning he arrived, in an old silver Range Rover, with flowers and many jewels and boxes of sweets. Dr Hamori would not let him in, but he climbed through the kitchen window, leaving a trail of petals and biscuits. He wore a suit with the shirt untucked and unbuttoned, revealing a greyish-pink belly like a mound of inedible ham and his sparse hair smelled of pomade.

He said, I Am Sorry, I Adore You, What a Terrible Mistake, Mea Culpa, I Will Spend the Rest of My Life with You Dear Beautiful Kay.

She put both hands over her mouth. We could tell the expulsion was there, tickling her tonsils, souring her tongue. We could smell the sick. George licked his lips with his tongue, watching her. She swallowed, and swallowed, clenching her eyes until it was deep inside her again. She went and packed her bags, leaving her trousers behind, and returned to the entrance hall, ready to leave, dressed in a high-necked, frilly Laura Ashley dress I once would have admired but no longer did.

Dr Hamori was horrified by what this twist might do to the morale and stamina of the rest of the patients, but he needn’t have worried because we all saw the glum expression on Kay’s face. Her trick had worked. She had a life ahead of her of eating slugs, tepid half-drunk cans of beer pulled from public bins, the hair clogging drain holes, the custard splotch left by an inebriated person on a cobblestoned street, the undigested, visible comestibles of canine faecal matter. Holding her flowers, wearing her jewels, she got into George’s Range Rover. I saw her despondently chewing on a carnation as they drove away.

Dr Hamori made me rice cakes spread with tahini and fermented cabbage for my train back to Edinburgh and gave me a Thermos of nettle tea. I was frightened to go to the station, but I was pleasingly indifferent to the sight of it when I arrived. Dr Hamori waved with a purple kerchief as my train departed, as in a film of old."

    "text": "Enero Rey, standing firm on the boat, stocky and beardless, swollen-bellied, legs astride, stares hard at the surface of the river and waits, revolver in hand.

Tilo, the kid, aboard the same boat, leans back, the rod butt at his hip, turning the reel handle, tugging the line: a glittering thread in the waning sun. El Negro, fifty-something like Enero, alongside the boat, water up to his balls, leans back as well, red-faced from the sun and hard work, rod bent as he winds in and lets out the line. The spool spinning and his breath a kind of wheeze. The river pancake flat.

Pump and reel, pump and reel. She’s hugging the bottom. Get her up, get her up.

After two, three hours, tired and almost through, Enero repeats the instructions in a murmur, like a prayer.

He feels dizzy. Pickled by the wine and heat. He looks up and his red eyes, sunk deep in his puffy face, are blinded and everything goes white and he’s lost and reaches for his head and ends up firing into the air.

Without stopping what he’s doing, Tilo grimaces and yells.

What the hell, you moron! Enero comes to.

All good. You guys keep going. Pump and reel, pump and reel. She’s hugging the bottom. Get her up, get her up.

She’s coming! She’s coming up!

Enero leans over the side. Sees it draw closer. A stain beneath the surface of the river. He takes aim and fires. Once. Twice. Three times. The blood rises, gushing, washes away. He sits up. Puts back the gun. Tucks it in the waistband of his shorts.

Tilo from the boat and El Negro from the water lift the creature out. Grabbing it by the fleshy grey frills. Throwing it on board.

Watch the stinger! Says Tilo.

He takes the knife, cuts the barb from the body, sends it back to the depths of the river.

Enero sits down with a thud on the seat in the boat. Sweaty-faced, head buzzing. Drinks a little water from the bottle. It’s warm, he drinks anyway, long gulps, then tips the rest over his head.

El Negro climbs in. The ray takes up so much space there’s almost nowhere to put his feet without treading on it. Must be some two hundred pounds, maybe two hundred twenty.

Christ she’s ugly!

Says Enero, slapping his thigh and laughing. The others laugh as well.

Fought us pretty hard. Says El Negro.

Enero picks up the oars and rows into the middle of the river and then turns and carries on, following the shore around to where they’d set up camp.

 

They’d left town at dawn in El Negro’s pickup. Tilo in the middle brewing the mate. Enero with his arm resting on the open window. El Negro at the wheel. They watched how the sun slowly climbed above the asphalt. Felt how the heat began to burn from early on. They listened to the radio. Enero took a leak by the roadside. At a petrol station they bought pastries and filled up on hot water for the mate.

All three of them pleased to be hanging out together. They’d been planning the trip for a while now. With one thing and another it kept getting called off.

El Negro had bought a new boat and wanted to try it out.

While they were crossing to the island in the brand-new boat they remembered, as usual, the first time they’d brought Tilo, who was still only tiny then, barely even walking, and how they’d got caught in a storm, the tents blown to shit, and the kid, little pipsqueak that he was, wound up sheltering in the boat propped on its side among some trees.

Your old man had hell to pay when we got back. Said Enero.

Again they told the story Tilo knows off by heart. How Eusebio smuggled the kid along without a word to Diana Maciel. He and Diana’d been split up pretty much since Tilo was born. Eusebio had him at weekends. And of course, that would be the weekend she realizes she’s forgotten to pack, in the bag with his clean clothes, some medication Tilo was taking. Diana stops by the house and there’s no one there. A neighbour tells her they’ve gone to the island.

And then the storm that tore through the whole area. The town as well. Diana with her heart in her mouth.

We were lucky, all of us. Said Enero.

Diana Maciel had laid into the three of them hard and for weeks they were banned from seeing Tilo or setting foot in her house.

On reaching the camp, they unload the ray and run a rope through the slits behind its eyes and hang it from a tree. The three bullet holes merge with its mottled back. If their edges weren’t paler, kind of pinkish, they’d look like part of the pattern.

Reckon I’ve earned myself a beer. Says Enero.

He’s sitting on the ground, his back to the tree and the ray. The buzzing in his head has stopped, but there’s still a kind of knot there.

Tilo goes and opens the cooler and takes a bottle from the water, from among the last few floating ice cubes. He pops the cap with the lighter then passes it on, so that it’s him, Enero Rey, the one who’s earned it, who first brings the bottle to his lips. The beer hits his mouth, all foam that goes streaming over his lips, painting white lace on his jet-black moustache. Like rinsing his mouth out with cotton wool. Only with the second swig does the cool, bitter liquid come.

El Negro and Tilo sit down as well, all three in a row, the bottle moving from hand to hand.

Too bad we don’t have a camera. Says El Negro.

They all turn their heads to look at the creature. It’s like an old blanket hanging in the shade.

 

Midway through the second bottle, a gaggle of kids appear, dark and wiry as eels, their faces nothing but eyes. They crowd around the ray, jostling, shoving.

Wooooah. Check it out check it out. It’s ginormous!

One grabs a stick and pokes it through the bullet holes.

Hey, hands off!

Says Enero, standing up suddenly, huge as a bear. And the little tykes scatter, vanishing back into the woods.

Since he’s on his feet now, since he’s made the effort to get up, Enero decides to go for a dip. The water clears his head.

He swims. Ducks under.

Floats on the surface.

The sun’s beginning to set and a slight breeze is creasing the river.

Just then he hears the engine and the lapping of waves. He moves aside, begins swimming to shore. The boat goes by, bounding over the water, ripping it in two like a rotten old rag. Attached to the back of the boat, a girl in a bikini is water-skiing. The boat swerves sharply and the girl is thrown in the water. From a distance, Enero sees her head emerge, her long hair plastered to her scalp.

He thinks of the Drowner. Gets out.

El Negro and Tilo are standing on the shore, arms folded, following the boat with their eyes.

Youngsters making a racket. Says El Negro.

 

It’s the same every weekend. They scare the fish. Ought to give them a scare ourselves one of these days.

The three of them turn and come face-to-face with the men. They hadn’t heard them approach. The islanders are light on their feet.

Afternoon.

Says the one who just spoke.

We heard from the kids and came to see. Beautiful animal!

The others are looking at the ray. Standing beside it, to measure it.

My name’s Aguirre, says the only one who talks, and he holds out his hand, which they each shake.

Enero Rey, says Enero, joining the group and greeting them one by one. El Negro and Tilo follow, doing the same.

Pretty big, huh?

Says Enero and pats it on the flank, then recoils as if it had burnt him.

Aguirre, inspecting the holes from up close, says.

Three? You shot it three times. Once would’ve done.

Enero grins, showing the gap where he’s missing a front tooth.

Guess I got carried away.

You want to watch that . . . getting carried away. Says Aguirre.

Tilo, pour some wine for our pals here. Says El Negro, stepping in between.

The boy runs to the shore, where they’d buried the demijohn to keep it cool. He brings it over and fills a tin cup to the brim.

He hands it to Aguirre, who raises it.

Cheers, he says and takes a swig and passes it to Enero. He looks for a moment at Enero’s left hand, which is missing a finger, but doesn’t ask any questions. Enero sees, but keeps quiet as well. Let him wonder.

Cristo here caught one way bigger the other day, Aguirre brags. How long were you out there?

All afternoon, the guy replies, with a sideways glance.

And how many times you shoot it? Once. Once is enough.

See, my pal here’s a bit of a klutz. El Negro says and laughs.

The TV people came and all, says the guy who landed a bigger ray than this one. Put him on the evening news, says Aguirre. Last Saturday the place was teeming with folks from Santa Fe and Paraná. Thought it was rays galore here. Like it’s that easy. You guys had some luck.

Technique, says Enero. Luck and technique. Luck alone won’t get you far.

Aguirre takes a pouch of tobacco from the pocket of his shirt, which he wears unbuttoned, open over his bony chest, over his wine-swollen belly. He rolls in the blink of an eye. Lights up. Takes a puff as he wanders over to the shore and stands gazing out at the water. Then he looks back at them and says.

So how long you staying?

Two, three days, says El Negro. It’s a nice island. You’re right there.

Says Aguirre.

 

El Negro steps into the woods. T-shirt slung over his shoulder, strides long but slow. Everything here in semi-darkness. Outside, the sun, a ball of fire half snuffed out by the river. He hears the soft sounds of birds and other small animals. A whisper of weeds.

Wild guinea pigs, weasels, viscachas scurrying through the tall grass. El Negro moves with care, with respect, as if entering a church. Dainty as a guazuncho deer. But of course he ends up treading on a twig, a bunch of curupí pods, and the result is deafening. The crackle of dry shells echoes through the alders and timbós, up and out of the dense circle of woodland. Announcing the presence of an intruder.

This man isn’t from these woods and the woods are well aware. But they leave him be. He can come in, he can stay for as long as it takes to gather kindling. Then the woods themselves will spit him out, his arms full of branches, back to the shore.

El Negro’s eyes begin to adjust and he makes out a camoati nest attached to a branch a bit farther on, like a head strung up by the hair. Around it the air quivers, thick with wasps.

He takes a deep breath and his chest fills with the scent of flowers, honey and the odd small dead animal. Everything smells sweet.

Distracted, he steps in a puddle and a cloud of mosquitoes fly up and surround him. Their high-pitched humming all he can hear. They prick at his back, his arms, his bare neck. He flaps his T-shirt, scaring them away. Then puts it on before they eat him alive.

Yeah, yeah, I’m going, I’m just getting some wood then I’m going.

He says aloud.

He collects a bundle of twigs to get the fire started. Knocks his head on a big hanging branch that’s still just about clinging to the tree. He puts down what he’s carrying. Tests the branch with his weight, pulls it free. The tearing wood makes a noise like the lightning that split it. He squats again, scoops up the twigs, tucks them under his arm. With his other hand he drags the heavy branch.

He emerges. The sky is orange, the air soupy and warm. A shiver runs down his spine to his backside. He turns, looks over his shoulder. He could swear the woods have closed up behind him.

    "text": "Li Qun sits with his arms crossed, frowning at the document on the desk in front of him.

 

LI QUN
So the meat goes straight onto the stones?

ASIGEN
That’s right. It’s sliced super thin, so when you put it on the hot stone –

LI QUN
And it’s cooked?

ASIGEN
Yes! The stone’s so hot, the meat’s done in minutes. A sprinkle of salt, a pinch of chilli powder. Delicious.

LI QUN
Is that sanitary?

ASIGEN
Way cleaner than a regular kitchen. Plus it’s super eco-friendly. Everything’s natural, from kitchen to table.

LI QUN
You don’t see that every day.

ASIGEN
That’s how we grill meat where I’m from. Mongolians have been eating this way for a thousand years. When you’re out on the plains, you just need a pile of stones, and that’s your kitchen.

LI QUN
It’s like something from another world.

ASIGEN
Yes, can’t you see people going crazy for this? But that’s not even the best bit. Guess what the best bit is?

 

A silence. Li Qun realises that Asigen is waiting for him to ask the question.

 

LI QUN
What’s the best bit?

ASIGEN
The best bit is, the meat doesn’t just look and taste great, it sizzles! (He hisses, szzzr!) Doesn’t that make your mouth water?

 

Li Qun frowns and looks back down at the document. Asigen stands and keeps talking.

 

ASIGEN
I know you must be wondering, when did this become the Department of Dining? You’re the Committee for Global Ecological Balance and Environmental Promotion. What’s grilled meat got to do with you? Well it absolutely does. Do you know how much meat the Chinese get through every day? (He clearly does not remember the actual figure and presses on quickly.)

More than anyone could count! You know how much natural gas we consume cooking all that meat? Even more! If my plan is approved, think how much natural gas we could save to use for more important things. Now, to be clear, this will be a major undertaking /

LI QUN
But wait why Yong Le Island?

ASIGEN
Ah well now you’ve got to the point.

 

Asigen walks to the whiteboard and points at the map.

 

ASIGEN
Yong Le is a small island not far from the equator in the south of China. It’s a pearl of a place. It absorbs the finest that the earth has to offer and mingles the essences of river and sea. Because of its unique location, the sun shines fiercely throughout the year, and the rocks remain hot enough to cook meat on. Because just to finish what I said earlier. This will be a major undertaking, starting with grilling meat, then when the temperature rises some more, we can proceed with Operation Ocean Hotpot.

LI QUN
Ocean hotpot? (He flips through the document.) You didn’t mention that in your proposal.

ASIGEN
I left it out for now – we haven’t reached the ideal temperature yet.

LI QUN
Ideal temperature?!

ASIGEN
I’ve spoken to quite a few experts who all said in about thirty years surface temperatures on Yong Le Island will be high enough that the rocks will make the sea around them boil. You could sit by the shore with the Pacific Ocean for your hotpot. Doesn’t that sound like a dream? Think about it. Seawater bubbling away. No need to add salt or seasoning. Just swirl your meat, and there you go. Small outlay, big return.

(Remembering his pitch, he changes his tone.) Do you know how many people in China eat hotpot each day, and how much natural gas that uses up? / If you were to divert that gas to other uses –

LI QUN
(Raising a hand.) I have to stop you there. There are all kinds of holes in your plan. I don’t want to go on about it / but the main problem –

ASIGEN
Holes? I spoke to a whole load of experts / and they said –

LI QUN
(Raising his voice.) The main problem is what you said a moment ago. ‘The ideal temperature’. It sounds like your grand plan isn’t to stop climate change or save the environment. In fact, this plan could only be implemented if the climate keeps deteriorating. You want things to get worse.

ASIGEN
(Momentarily stunned.) You . . . you’ve misunderstood /

LI QUN
Oh? What have I misunderstood? You said yourself, in thirty years when Yong Le Island reaches ‘the ideal temperature’ the ocean will turn into a hotpot. You want to turn the Pacific into your very own hotpot restaurant. Tell me, which bit have I misunderstood?

 

Asigen steps away from the map, pacing the room a couple of times before returning to his seat.

 

ASIGEN
You’ve got it in for me, don’t you.

LI QUN
I’m just doing my job – following the rules.

ASIGEN
I know how it is. Like anyone would believe a guy like me could come up with a plan to save the environment.

LI QUN
I promise you, the committee only looks at two things: how feasible a proposal is, and what it could actually do for the environment.

ASIGEN
I may not be book-smart, but I’m telling you the truth. Ever since I was a child, I’ve had this knack for protecting the environment.

LI QUN
Oh, really?

ASIGEN
No matter where I go, all I have to do is take a sip of the local water, swirl it around (he gargles) and I can taste what’s missing, or what there’s too much of. I might not know the whole periodic table by heart, but my mouth knows what’s what. Call it a talent.

LI QUN
Some talent.

ASIGEN
Why does everything you say sound sarcastic?

LI QUN
You’re imagining things (looking at his watch). Anyway, let’s get back to your proposal (flipping through the document). This is your third application?

ASIGEN
Yes. I suppose it’s all recorded there.

LI QUN
Let’s see (still flipping). Your first one was . . . to install a giant filter over the entire city of Beijing?

ASIGEN
Exactly. A dome, with a membrane to keep out pollution from neighbouring cities, that would take carbon dioxide and bond it with chlorophyll to release oxygen. A perfectly balanced air circulation system.

LI QUN
Bold idea. Why wasn’t it approved?

ASIGEN
Someone on the committee thought it wasn’t socialist enough.

LI QUN
(A little anxious.) Quite right, you should definitely work on improving your awareness in that area.

ASIGEN
Sure, but my plan was bigger than that. Beijing was just the start. If it worked, I’d have expanded the dome to cover the whole country.

LI QUN
(Flipping through the document.) And your second proposal was . . . (he looks up at Asigen) installing pumps along the Himalayas to capture glacier meltwater?

ASIGEN
The Himalayan glaciers are melting! The Himalayas, Mr Li! Can you believe that? The roof of the world, and its underpants are melting off. How is this happening? When I first read about it, I lay awake night after night until I had a solution (he goes back to the map and gestures frantically at the Himalayas). The melted ice flows down here. If we intercept it, we could pump it back up to the peaks. It’s cooler there, so the water would freeze back into glaciers. That’s how we’d save the Himalayas.

 

Li Qun starts to speak, but Asigen stops him.

 

ASIGEN
I know what you’re about to say. You’re right, the water pump would burn fossil fuels too. But sometimes you have to choose the lesser of two evils, and preserving the Himalayas is still more urgent.

LI QUN
Actually, I was going to ask why this proposal was rejected.

ASIGEN
The committee said the Himalayas don’t belong to us (he points at the map). Look – India, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan. Getting them all to agree would be a nightmare. That’s reasonable. I should have thought of that myself.

LI QUN
(A pause.) I must admit, your current proposal is significantly more feasible than the previous two.

ASIGEN
Brilliant! You’re far-sighted, Mr Li.

LI QUN
However, we’ve received other proposals that are, frankly, even more attractive.

 

Asigen senses that things are not going well. His spirits droop, and he returns to his seat.

 

ASIGEN
More attractive?

LI QUN
Take this one, for example. (He pulls a folder from the stack on his right.) It’s a plan for the National Taoist Association to ration incense and candle offerings across the country.

ASIGEN
Huh?

LI QUN
Under this plan, every Taoist temple in China would limit or even ban the burning of incense and candles.

ASIGEN
So Taoists would have to stop making offerings to reduce emissions? How would Lao Zi feel about that?

LI QUN
Mind your words, Mr Asigen. I’ll ask you to bear in mind that this country staunchly supports freedom of religion.

ASIGEN
I mean if the Taoist priests themselves are willing to stop burning incense, of course that’s fine. But what about regular people visiting the temples?

LI QUN
Taoism teaches that ‘Heaven and Humanity are one’. I’m sure you’ve heard that before. It’s a classic tenet – no Heaven, no Humanity.

Do you know how many Taoist temples there are in this country? More than two thousand. Reducing their emissions would be a significant achievement.

ASIGEN
I see. And with the Taoist priests leading the way, the Buddhist monks would rush to follow, right? Clever move.

LI QUN
No need for sarcasm. Compared to your dome or pump ideas, this proposal requires a tiny amount of funding and would deliver a huge benefit. Plus, it would be a distinctly Chinese solution to the global crisis.

ASIGEN
How come?

LI QUN
Because only China has Taoist temples.

ASIGEN
But if we didn’t, there’d never have been incense to burn in the first place.

LI QUN
Now you’re just splitting hairs.

ASIGEN
I’m confused. My plan gives people a choice. Why go with one that forces them against their will?

LI QUN
Look how dire the situation is. If we didn’t need to push people to act against their will, would this department even exist?

ASIGEN
Now who’s splitting hairs.

 

Li Qun glances at his watch and begins tidying the papers on his desk, returning them to a neat stack on the right.

 

ASIGEN
Look, I know you get off work soon, but can’t you give me a few more minutes?

 

Li Qun ignores him, and keeps tidying.

 

ASIGEN
I was born in Inner Mongolia. You know the sort of place, vast grasslands. That Inner Mongolia. Although there isn’t much grass left these days. Still vast. There was a children’s song I sang as a boy: How beautiful the plains of Mongolia, wind parts the grass and reveals the cattle. I was always confused. How could the grass be so tall that you’d only see the cattle when the wind blew it aside? You’d have to walk miles just to find grass that reached your ankles. I asked my mum where the grass in the song was, and why we didn’t graze our sheep there. She said the song was just a song. If it were the truth, it would be a news report, not a children’s song.

LI QUN
I wasn’t going to say anything, Mr Asigen, but now you’re going on about children’s songs and your mother, I do start to wonder.

ASIGEN
Wonder about what?

LI QUN
It’s clear from these proposals that you have a vivid imagination.

ASIGEN
That’s what my friends tell me.

LI QUN
No question about it. But do you understand that what we’re facing is a climate emergency? This is a huge issue. All of humanity needs to act.

ASIGEN
Of course I understand. That’s why I’m doing what I can to contribute.

LI QUN
Honestly, I’m not sure you’re taking this seriously.

ASIGEN
I’m an extrovert! I like to joke around. Don’t be fooled by my face – I’m a serious guy.

LI QUN
Looking at your CV (he glances down), you’ve worked in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Tianjin. If we don’t curb carbon emissions, scientists say those cities won’t exist by the end of this century.

ASIGEN
I’ve seen that report.

LI QUN
Then you ought to see how urgent this problem is! The Americans have given up on the world. It’s up to us now.

ASIGEN
I’ve heard about that too. Rising temperatures won’t hurt the US much. They’re far enough north that a few degrees won’t hurt them. They know exactly what they’re doing.

LI QUN
It’s irresponsible to indulge in malicious speculation, Mr Asigen. We Chinese have always held up our virtue on shoulders of iron. Those who are capable are called upon to serve the world.

ASIGEN
Absolutely right. That’s why I’m here, trying to do my bit. I want to travel thousands of miles to some tiny southern island, to contribute what I can. I care about our planet’s future.

LI QUN
From where I’m standing, it seems you’re mostly thinking of your bottom line.

ASIGEN
I’m disappointed that you’d think that of me.

LI QUN
If you were sitting where I am, Mr Asigen, you’d be more than disappointed. The earth is on fire, and the only thing you people think about is how you can turn that to your advantage. Do you not understand what a climate catastrophe is? It’s the most significant act of terrorism being carried out in the world today. It’s unprecedented. Every person living on this planet today should be terrified. But what have they done instead?

ASIGEN
(After some thought.) You think people are ducking the issue?

LI QUN
Exactly. They’ve done nothing.

ASIGEN
That’s a bit harsh. Even a guy like me knows this is happening, and aren’t there meetings about this every other day now?

LI QUN
You’re from China, you should know better than anyone – meetings don’t solve problems. Look, I’m not here to discuss bureaucracy with you. I’m just saying, most people think the truth is black and white, but really it’s in full colour.

ASIGEN
Full colour? I have no idea what you’re talking about.

LI QUN
People are afraid of colour. Fear turns into denial. The collective unconsciousness of humanity will fall apart as the planet continues heating up.

ASIGEN
My god.

LI QUN
What?

ASIGEN
The world is doomed, and you have the nerve to lecture me about philosophy.

 

Li Qun stands angrily and checks his watch.

 

ASIGEN
Don’t blame me. I really have no idea what you’re trying to say.

LI QUN
(Still standing.) I might as well tell you directly. The committee has decided to reject your proposal. I wanted to give you the opportunity to expand on your ideas in person, but nothing you’ve said today will make me recommend they change their minds. Just like the previous two times, you’ll receive the decision in the post within fifteen working days.

ASIGEN
(A brief pause.) Could you tell me the reason for this decision?

LI QUN
The letter will explain.

ASIGEN
I want you to say it to my face.

LI QUN
(A brief pause.) Your proposal is full of contradictions. Let’s take the most basic example. There’s no agriculture on Yong Le Island. All the food would have to be shipped in from the nearest port, and guess what? Ships burn fuel. In the end, more carbon would be emitted than saved. Is that clear enough? And that’s not even the biggest issue.

ASIGEN
What’s that?

LI QUN
Yong Le itself is a low-lying reef. According to our forecasts, if temperatures continue to rise at the current rate, the island will be underwater in thirty years. By the time we’ve reached what your experts call ‘the ideal temperature’, the island will be submerged.

 

Aisgen slumps in his chair. A long silence.

 

LI QUN
I guess your experts didn’t mention that.

ASIGEN
The precious pearl . . . underwater . . .

LI QUN
(Glancing at his watch.) And now, if you don’t mind, Mr Asigen, I’m done for the day.

 

Asigen nods, picks up his briefcase and stands to leave. He takes a few steps, then hesitates.

 

ASIGEN
Actually, Mr Li, I hadn’t finished that story about my mum. Just a few minutes more, I promise.

LI QUN
I stopped you earlier because I couldn’t see what your mum had to do with global climate catastrophe.

ASIGEN
Mr Li, I’m guessing you’ve spent all your life in the city. You turn on the tap, and there’s drinking water. You walk into a supermarket and the shelves are stocked with food. Of course, you can’t see the connection. You’ve never sat on dry, cracked earth not knowing what to do. Staring at your parched cattle, with no grass to eat. Hoping for even a minute of rain. Wishing your tears, or the blood from your wrists, could water that soil.

LI QUN
I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have interrupted. Please, go on.

ASIGEN
We herders travel to find water and grassland. One year, my mum, my sister and I herded more than a hundred sheep and dozens of horses for three days and nights, looking for pasture. We moved as fast as we could, but when we finally reached the riverbed, it was dry. There was no grass to be seen. The animals were so hungry they gnawed at withered roots and tried to eat pebbles. My sister and I sat down and burst into tears. (He pauses, collecting himself.)

My mum hugged us and told us the story of Yong Le Island. She said, My son, our motherland is enormous and contains all manner of things, not just this patch of grassland. To the south, near the equator, there’s an island called Yong Le. It absorbs the finest the earth has to offer, and mingles the river and sea. The pearl of our southern coast. It’s surrounded by sea, and rains all the time, so it never dries out. People who live there must be so happy.

(Another pause.) I’m a coward, Mr Li. I ran away because I wanted to live like you city folk. Turn on the tap for water, go to the supermarket for food. I abandoned my mother and sister to that withered grassland, and came here by myself. Men are no good – we leave women behind to face the parched earth alone.

LI QUN
(A pause.) I shouldn’t have stopped you. I’m sorry.

ASIGEN
That’s fine. I’m used to being ignored.

LI QUN
No one should be used to that.

ASIGEN
You were right earlier – there’s nothing we can count on. We’re always talking about Mother Earth. Not just because she gave birth to us, but because a mother never betrays her children, even when they betray her.

LI QUN
(A pause.) If Yong Le Island means so much to you, why wasn’t it in your first two proposals?

ASIGEN
You’ve misunderstood, Mr Li. It’s not Yong Le Island that’s important to me – or maybe it is now, but there’s a bigger picture. When I was a boy, my teacher used to tell us that the earth is like a person. You can’t just treat the head when you have a headache, or examine just your leg when it hurts. Everything in your body is connected. All I really want is for my mum to see the grasslands, those in the children’s song. If that means putting Beijing under a dome, or installing water pumps along the Himalayas, or developing Yong Le Island, then that’s what I’ll do. That’s the connection between my mum and the climate. (He pauses, smiling bitterly, then starts to exit.) All underwater. Sorry to have wasted your time. Goodbye.

LI QUN
Wait a minute.

 

Asigen stops and turns back to look at him. Li Qun hesitates for a moment, then sits down and gestures for Asigen to do the same.

 

LI QUN
Please, have a seat.

ASIGEN
Was there something else?

 

Li Qun takes Asigen’s proposal from the file and flips through it again. Finally, he sets it down.

 

LI QUN
I’m going to approve your proposal.

ASIGEN
What?

LI QUN
It’s approved.

ASIGEN
Because I told you a story about my mum?

LI QUN
Of course not. The committee takes these decisions very seriously.

ASIGEN
But you said the committee had already decided to reject me.

LI QUN
Over the course of this interview, I realised that your vision had scope for further development.

ASIGEN
But you said my proposal was full of contradictions!

LI QUN
We’ve approved even less orthodox proposals before, some with far bigger issues. We’ll just have to solve the problems as they arise.

ASIGEN
This is so . . . unexpected.

 

Li Qun gingerly picks up the red cube from his desk, opens it with reverence, and pulls out the red ink stamp. Once more, he glances at his watch.

 

LI QUN
Don’t just sit there, hand me your proposal so I can give it the stamp of approval.

 

Asigen opens his briefcase, pulls out the document, and moves to hand it over. Suddenly he seems to think of something. Li Qun reaches for it, but Asigen resists. They tug at it for a moment.

 

LI QUN
Let go.

ASIGEN
Something about this feels wrong.

LI QUN
We’re putting our trust in you, young man. Don’t waste the opportunity. Time is precious.

ASIGEN
No, this feels all wrong! (He pulls the document back, stands and starts pacing around in a frenzy.) All wrong! We spent so much time talking nonsense, and by the end, I was convinced my proposal was ridiculous. You – you keep looking at your watch! Are you approving my proposal just so you can head home? You’re a committee member! An expert! How can your only thought be about knocking off work? We’re about to be underwater . . . Do you know how this makes me feel?

LI QUN
How?

ASIGEN
No one believes we can actually change anything! No one, not a single person! You least of all! You think the whole world is made up of bastards who don’t care what happens to the next generation, and nutcases with wild ideas, like me. Yes, I’m sure of it – you don’t actually believe we can prevent climate catastrophe.

LI QUN
(Putting the ink stamp down on the table.) Please calm down, Mr Asigen. Look – (he glances at his watch) – I’m still here, well past the end of my workday, patiently listening to you talk.

ASIGEN
You hold the rubber stamp, but you don’t believe in anything. Every day, children are taught that the hole in the ozone layer is getting bigger and that we need to reduce emissions, but the air-con in every city in the world is turned up so high we’re freezing to death! No one believes we can actually change /

LI QUN
(Loudly.) Mr Asigen!

 

Startled, Asigen freezes. Li Qun stands.

 

LI QUN
You think you’re the only one who cares about this planet? That only your grand plan can save the earth? Sure, a lot of what you say is true, but you don’t get to accuse the rest of us of giving up. Because that’s not the case!

ASIGEN
(A pause.) Very good.

LI QUN
What?

ASIGEN
So you can still get angry. That’s very good. It makes you seem more like a real person.

LI QUN
What do you mean by that?

ASIGEN
I meet people like you all the time – calm, polite, blank-faced. At first, I was surprised – it seemed to me as if you lot had never lost your temper, or gotten into a real argument. You’d never had to persuade anyone of anything. Gradually, I started to realise: it’s because you’ve never needed to lose your temper or persuade anyone about anything. That makes you a rubber stamp, not a real person.

LI QUN
Stop saying ‘you lot’ and ‘them’. When it comes to climate change, there’s only one group of people, and that’s ‘us’.

ASIGEN
That sounds very moving, but Mr Li, if ‘you lot’ don’t support ‘us’, we can’t do much to change things.

LI QUN
I may be one of ‘them’ to you, but not to the people above me.

ASIGEN
‘I’, ‘them’, ‘you’ . . . You’ve lost me.

LI QUN
Forget it. The point is, not everyone has given up.

ASIGEN
Have you?

LI QUN
In my own way, no.

ASIGEN
What way is that?

LI QUN
If I’d given up, you wouldn’t even have had the chance to step through that door. But it’s true, I don’t believe in very much. I did once.

ASIGEN
What changed?

LI QUN
Everything. Every day, I come to work, and go through these proposals. So many figures, so many plans. We’ve planted this many trees, reduced emissions by that much, launched however many schemes. That’s my world: documents, and numbers and faces. After a while, it makes me feel . . .

ASIGEN
Like there might be hope for the world?

LI QUN
The opposite. I have to force myself to believe. The data’s there. We’re working hard. We haven’t broken faith with this planet. But I see no sign of faith. Everything is slow and calm, even the despair is slow and calm. Like someone with cancer who knows he’s dying but keeps smoking and drinking, hoping for a miracle.

Sometimes I panic because I realize that everyone’s just pretending to work hard, performing a role to mask their terror. It’s not apathy that’s laying waste to us, it’s our faithlessness.

ASIGEN
So you’re just playing a role too?

LI QUN
Sometimes I am. And sometimes I can’t tell.

ASIGEN
What about right now? Are you acting?

LI QUN
Acting what?

ASIGEN
Acting the part of someone powerful believing that someone powerless might be able to save the world.

LI QUN
I’m not powerful, and you’re not powerless. Power isn’t in a rubber stamp – it’s in your actions. And no, I’m not acting.

ASIGEN
But you changed your mind so quickly . . .

LI QUN
Let’s put it this way. The reason I approved your proposal is simple: I believe in you.

ASIGEN
You believe in me? What’s there to believe in, an uneducated person like me?

LI QUN
Educated people are mostly not to be trusted.

ASIGEN
My proposal is still full of holes.

LI QUN
There are numerous ways to plug holes in science. But once a person loses faith, nothing can repair that.

ASIGEN
I’ve never met a committee member like you, Mr Li. You’re odd.

LI QUN
Not as odd as you. Honestly, looking at you, I see myself when I was young. Full of weird, impractical ideas.

ASIGEN
Really?

LI QUN
You think every single person with a rubber stamp was born a bureaucrat? Yet you have what we all lack. You have faith, and the desire for change, and a powerful emotional motivation. Protect those. Everything else is secondary.

ASIGEN
(Delighted.) Thank you, Mr Li!

LI QUN
And I can introduce you to some more orthodox experts. They’ll help make your proposal more practical.

 

Asigen hands over the form, and Li Qun looks it over.

 

LI QUN
Your thinking may be a little eccentric, but I like proposals like yours.

ASIGEN
I feel like you’re just using me to shake things up. But that doesn’t matter – as long as you approve this.

LI QUN
They frequently turn down proposals I’ve approved, but I have a feeling we’re not too far from real change.

ASIGEN
Do you think I should open with my mum’s story next time?

LI QUN
Honestly, I don’t think that tactic would be effective with anyone else.

ASIGEN
You know, Mr Li, grilling meat on Yong Le Island’s hot stones is just the first step in my plan. My ultimate goal is to make the island prosperous, and maybe even transport their surplus rain to the drought zone of Inner Mongolia. For instance, a giant fan to blow all the rainclouds inland . . . No, wait, even better:

Let’s set up some machines in the most polluted cities to absorb carbon dioxide, which we’ll filter and compress. Then we’ll hire a few of Elon Musk’s rockets, and shoot the carbon right into space. Poof! Just like that, no more worries about exceeding our carbon quota. How about it, Mr Li? Why not approve all these ideas at once, and we can change the world together.

LI QUN
One step at a time.

 

Li Qun reverentially holds the ink stamp high, slowly brings it down on Asigen’s proposal, then returns it to its red box. He holds up the proposal, blows on it to dry the ink, and hands it to Asigen with both hands. Asigen stands and respectfully takes it with both hands.

 

LI QUN
I hope you won’t disappoint the committee, Mr Asigen. We hope that you’ll make a measurable contribution to improving the climate of the region.

ASIGEN
You can count on me, Mr Li! So, what’s next?

LI QUN
What’s next with what?

ASIGEN
Now that my proposal’s been approved, what happens?

LI QUN
You’ll need to submit more detailed materials for the next level of committee members to review. There’ll be more stringent evaluations later. Be ready for those. Someone else might express doubt about your proposal at any stage, or even turn it down.

ASIGEN
(As if he hasn’t heard.) I’m going to Yong Le Island . . .

LI QUN
You’ll continue adding to your submission materials, and they’ll be sent for a final review.

ASIGEN
And then it’s done.

LI QUN
If you pass the final review, the committee will send it to the central bureau to be audited, and they’ll grant ultimate approval.

ASIGEN
And after that, it’s done?

LI QUN
Then, yes, you can take your proposal to Yong Le Island, where the local government will put it through their own evaluation process.

ASIGEN
And then it’s done?

LI QUN
Once the local government has granted permission, you can take all these documents and go develop Yong Le Island.

ASIGEN
This sounds like quite a long process.

LI QUN
You need to be in less of a hurry, young man. What did I just say? One step at a time, one step at a time.

ASIGEN
I understand that, I’m just a bit worried. What if the climate deteriorates even faster than we’re predicting /

LI QUN
It won’t. No need to question the process.

ASIGEN
Got it. One step at a time. How long do you think it will be before I can go to Yong Le Island?

LI QUN
Soon, I daresay. Very soon.

 

Asigen holds his proposal high. Both men simultaneously look up at it. Lights fade. Final spot on the proposal. A moment’s pause. Blackout."

    "text": "Hiiii! Good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning!

Great, great, and yours?

Yes, I went. I couldn’t not, could I. Or my mother would have disowned me. My family, my mother, she loves Christmas. I told you, didn’t I: every year, in November, she throws away all the decorations and buys new ones. Glass baubles, miniature Father Christmases, styrofoam snow. All new. To renew life. Throw everything away, buy it all again.

I don’t much like this woman. Her voice is nasally and shrill, but when she laughs the air comes out in a cough, all through her mouth. A happy bray. She’s going to tell me she travelled to Mato Grosso, where her mother lives. My mother and father. And the whole gang of cousins! (Laughs) Somewhere in the middle of nowhere, fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, a ranch satellite town. Cattle and soy, cattle and soy. She’s going to tell me what the journey was like: she forgot her headphones. She had to travel in silence for nine hours, the bus left Belo Horizonte in the afternoon and got to Mato Grosso at night. On Christmas Eve itself. Not even a radio, imagine, not even a little radio! She’ll try to describe the scenery, that green, brown, dull gold sameness. The electricity poles marking the speed of the bus; the wires going dooown, the wires going uuup, up and down, up and down. Further back, the grasslands going by slowly, and even further back, the hills going by even more slowly. When night fell the road went into the mountains and she saw the moon and the stars twirling: bend to the left, bend to the right. She’ll try and explain: the whole scene moving at different speeds and in different directions, like a puppet show. This comparison will sprout from the sludge in her head, it wants to float up to the light, but it’s no use. The jolts in perspective have left her confused.

 

 


 
 

Daddy picked her up from the bus station.

Who was at the house? Were they all there already?

‘Me, your mother, grandpa, Auntie Sá, your cousin and her boyfriend . . .’

How am I meant to know which cousin? It was cousin Marô, with her boyfriend, who she’d brought to meet the family. So it’s getting serious. Next there’ll be a wedding, which this woman calls ‘getting hitched’ because she’s just back from the sticks.

‘Serious, oh yes.’

What was he like?

‘He doesn’t like music.’

What?

‘Says he doesn’t like it. It disturbs him.’

Daddy drove, giving her a smile every now and again, neither of them talking. As soon as they went through the gates, he took a deep breath and said:

‘There’ll be an empty seat at the table.’

In previous years, there’d been no end of family. They’d had to improvise, more tables, deckchairs, benches, mummy sitting on a pouffe, joyfulness unbridled.

It seemed the cousin had changed too.

‘You know your cousin likes to read, don’t you. So your mother started telling her she was reading a book about that guy who invented the iPod. You know what your cousin said? That nobody reads that kind of book, a book about the guy who invented the iPod, she’d never be capable of inventing the iPod. That she’d thrown her money away. That a book like that was just to take money from people like her. Not that your mother is going to invent the iPod, but . . .’

 

snow is chic

 

The dogs of the house greeted her. Two Fila Brasileiros, muscular, half-feral. Not those little dogs rich women have, with bows and no fleas, no ticks. These dogs had cayenne ticks, horse ticks! They’d get them out in the scrub. Rodolfo and Maguila, their names were. After that, the whole family: yay. I love my family. (Don’t I.)

The boyfriend was the last in the queue for hugs. A big guy with a fat neck, a goatee and a gormless smile. The strong fat type – you know the strong fat type? – and pretty ugly. The cousin, she was no beauty, one of those teachers who think they don’t need to make more than three thousand reais a month, one of those women who think they don’t need to shave their armpits, but shave them anyway. The cousin, she’d do better for herself if she learned a few make up tips and went out dancing and was more persistent and prayed to Saint Anthony. You can get tutorials for anything on the internet. A kiss on the cheek: hi, pleased to meet you, and the boyfriend said his name. She said hers. Pleased to meet you.

Mummy! They hug again.

Christmas dinner is already on the table, awaiting her arrival.

On the stereo, Sinatra singing jingle bells.

The father always sits at the head of the table, with the mother on his right and the daughter on his left. Beside the daughter, cousin Marô. Opposite the cousin, an empty chair, though the place is set with a plate and cutlery. Beside the empty place, the boyfriend. Why didn’t he sit in front of his girlfriend? I don’t know, I don’t care. Opposite him, Auntie Sá. At the other end of the table, the patriarch, the father’s father, grandpa, staring with curiosity and rage at the new intruder, a hunk of flesh twice his size and a quarter of his age.

The plates and cups and saucers are Chinese, from when China still sold expensive things. The cutlery actual silver. On the glass serving dishes: roast turkey; a Chester super-chicken in apricot sauce; ham glazed with honey, pineapple and cloves; cod with boiled potatoes and red, green and yellow peppers. Bowls of: caramelized fruit; dried fruit; rice with raisins; banana farofa. Full-fat desserts: crème caramel; panettone; dulce de leche; cheese and guava; coconut brittle and Grace Kelly cakes, a family tradition.

This year’s decorations: a Christmas tree with white plastic foliage, even whiter plastic imitation snow on top. Gold glitter. Gold glass baubles hanging from the branches. A Star of David, gold, fixed to the top of the tree. Gold ornaments stuck on the walls, Father Christmases in white and gold woolly hats, white reindeer, the words have a merry snowy christmas! in English. The temperature: 36°C.

‘Snow is chic,’ says the mother.

The boyfriend gives a low, mocking cough.

mother: I change the decorations every year.

The boyfriend smiles, doesn’t answer. She’s not his mother-in-law, he doesn’t have to answer.

grandpa: (loudly) She changes them every year.

The boyfriend smiles at the old man. Silence.

Everybody starts talking at the same time. Their voices swell and soften. Silence. Daddy starts cutting the ham. Grandpa sticks his fork in the turkey. Is there no pork shoulder? Auntie Sá asks about boyfriends. Every auntie asks the same thing, don’t they. (Laughs). Someone asks for the rice to be passed. Ah . . . boyfriends, nothing, or almost nothing. A few wimps, boys, no assertiveness; all poodle. A woman wants a Fila Brasileiro, a Labrador. Not one of those pit bull types from the gym, mind you, none of that. Nor a Rottweiler, not that either. A brute, pero no mucho.

Every day on her way home from work, she passes a jiu-jitsu gym (DODÔ FIGHT). From the street, she sees the tough guys grappling on the floor – men, those stocky women and, sometimes, a scared-looking fat kid (dad’s idea, put the boy in a fight). From the street, she smells sweat mixed with tatami, the reek of man and rubber that she adores, that frightens her, that gives her goosebumps, a man like that turns me to jelly. And if you could have the smell without the man, how good would that be! There’s no prince charming without the smell of tatami.

grandpa: (Loudly) Did you bring a present?

father: He doesn’t need to bring a present.

grandpa: (Loudly) It would be polite.

auntie sá: He can join our Secret Santa.

The boyfriend says nothing.

cousin marô: He’s going to play charades.

mother: Nobody needs to bring a present. Pass the turkey?

 

cuiabá is not chic

 

mother: Doesn’t he remind you of someone?

auntie sá: He does, doesn’t he?

father: Of who?

(The father realises who. His face goes as red as a pepper.)

auntie sá: He really does . . .

father: I’m going to the bathroom. Excuse me.

mother: Napkin. Wipe your mouth.

He wipes his mouth. Visibly upset. And exits. White cloth napkin with gold hems, brand new, thirty-five reais each.

mother: (To the boyfriend) Do you like the decorations?

daughter: (Jokey voice) She changes them every year.

Nobody laughs.

The boy nods.

auntie sá: There really is a resemblance. What’s your father’s name?

The boy answers.

The mother and the aunt whisper.

grandpa: (Loudly) What?

auntie sá: He isn’t from Cuiabá.

mother: Where are you from?

auntie sá: Pass the turkey?

The boyfriend doesn’t say where he’s from.

auntie sá: Do you remember?

mother: The past is past. Over and done. Pass the cod.

grandpa: (Loudly) Is there no pork shoulder?

Everyone falls silent, passing plates and serving dishes to one another, until the father comes back from the bathroom. He sits and wipes his mouth with the napkin, slowly, almost voluptuously. A clean mouth is a very pleasant thing. Daddy is clean, daddy never did anyone any harm. Faithful to God.

father: Zaga cut his leg. Looked deep.

mother: (Explaining to the audience) Zaga is the caretaker.

grandpa: (Loudly) He knows how to turn his eyelids inside out so you only see the fleshy side. Like an animal. His wife has hepatitis. Hepatitis A or B.

father: Or C.

grandpa: (Loudly) What?

boyfriend: Hepatitis est omnis divisa in partes tres.

An astonished silence followed his words. It must have been funny.

grandpa: (Loudly) What?

The boyfriend smiles, but doesn’t answer. He doesn’t repeat or explain the joke. Not even cousin Marô understood what he was trying to say.

grandpa: (Loudly) Son, who did you vote for president?

father: You don’t have to answer.

mother: I really like this year’s decorations. I chose them. Don’t you like them? It’s a shame to throw them all away afterwards. But we have to renew.

The boy doesn’t answer. He gives an odd smile.

Then, you won’t believe what happened. He sniffed the air like a dog and got up from the table, my cousin’s boyfriend. He looked like he was possessed. Everyone stood up, as though overcome by a profound solemnity. Then he turned his back and walked towards the stairs. Everyone followed, including me, even now I can’t say why. It was like a funeral procession. Then they realised there was no music playing. Not a single jingle bell. The sound of footsteps going after the boy. Stairs. Someone helped Grandpa climb them. The boy went towards a room that nobody ever opened. It was like he already knew. When mummy realised where we were going, she stood still, watching. Watching her family leave. Her daughter beckoned her to follow, even though she didn’t know where she was going. The mother remained impassive, panic-struck.

The boy turned the handle, but the door was locked. Everyone looked at my mother, didn’t they, she has all the keys to the house. But the mother didn’t react at all. Everything was about to fall apart. Then the boy kicked the door once, twice. The lock held. So then my father, my father seemed hypnotised, he went over and broke down the door with one shove of his shoulder. Inside, there were dozens of cardboard boxes stacked on top of each other.

You’ll never believe what was in the boxes.

The decorations from all the Christmases before.

    "text": "Their love grew deeper every day. They were lovers, partners, best friends. The connection they first felt at university had only strengthened over the course of their foreign adventure. Minor betrayals had been forgiven or kept under wraps. Through the strains of everyday life, they had learned to rely on each other. Tom called Anna’s parents without fail once a week; Anna wrote his emails in German for him. They had a joint Volksbank account but separate Netflix profiles, although the algorithm suggested the same shows for both of them. Either of them could choose anything on their joint behalf – be it a dish from a menu or an apartment – without a second thought, confident that the other would like it. They would fight over silly things: random social media storms, a form they were supposed to fill in. Every other Sunday they would clean the apartment while listening to old Eurovision songs. They never doubted they would grow old together. The sex was infrequent and bad.

Or at least that’s what they feared. It might be a Friday night and they would have arrived home freezing cold and high from a housewarming in Wedding. It might be a Sunday morning, too early to get out of bed, but with the summer sun already up and warming the room through the blackout curtain. The possibility would hang in the air – perhaps it had been a week since the last time, or they both glimpsed an opportunity – and a gesture by one of them would awaken that possibility in the other. Without undressing, Anna would press her crotch against Tom’s hip, pinning his wrists down onto the mattress so that he couldn’t touch her with his cold hands. Or Tom would test to see if she was awake by running a hand softly, almost imperceptibly, down her back, and then slipping it under the elastic of her knickers. A back would arch, a neck would roll to one side.

Tom would first use his fingers, then go down on her until she came, which happened just often enough to constitute being often enough. Sometimes he would use the lightest possible touch, deliberately slowing down when he could see her cheeks start to flush. Sometimes he would run the tip of his tongue over and around her clitoris before sliding one finger inside her, then another. Sometimes she would ask him to take her from behind but to stay absolutely still, just kissing her neck while she slowly gyrated her hips and touched herself from the front with her eyes closed. They might be on the yoga mat. They might be in the shower. Anna would come first, or, less commonly, give up trying, which he would take as permission to let go and come within seconds, in a condom, on the bedsheets or in the pool of water that collected around the drain.

That routine was perfected fairly early on in their relationship, and had always satisfied them. If ever one of them wasn’t in the mood, the other would understand without getting offended or feeling rejected. On the other hand, if one of them got horny during the working day, the other would play along and let themselves be dragged onto the sofa, or tease them for a while, pretending to be very absorbed in their working. The whole thing could take five minutes or half an hour. Afterwards, one of them would sit on the other’s lap, their skin covered in goosebumps. Or they would both get straight out of bed to make breakfast in the nude, the smell of sex still clinging to their bodies. Or they would cuddle in the dark feeling sleep approach and listening in silence to the other’s breathing. And for a moment they would feel happy, close.

The moment would pass. A thought would worm its way into that bliss: that was the same sex they’d had last week, two months ago, three years ago. Looking at it objectively, it probably was on the short side. And unimaginative, perhaps? Anal sex didn’t do it for either of them. Anna had been curious about rimming but Tom was too self-conscious. He wasn’t crazy about blowjobs, but he did like to be choked just before coming, which Anna found a bit scary. They would climax once and then call it a day, lie in each other’s arms and silently wonder: Shouldn’t they fuck more often, come harder? What were they missing out on by dismissing toys and sex clubs and BDSM? Had they ruled out polyamory because it wasn’t for them, or because they were priggish and scared?

The world around them offered such an exciting image of how their sex life could be. Social media accounts dedicated to sex positivity endorsed rings and plugs, bullets and vibrators, and silicone strap-ons of all shapes and sizes in shiny chrome or pastel colours. Their friends would either talk about the emotional arbitration involved in poly relationships or scroll through their joint Tinder, checking out potential candidates for a threesome that weekend. The ads that would appear between the paragraphs of the online lifestyle articles they read would be for colourful marble-effect dildos shaped like tigers and dragons. At the clubs they went to, women with shocking pink or bright green hair and dressed in skimpy strips of nylon fishnet would proffer their boots for worship to strangers wrapped in latex and patent leather; there would be couples and threesomes cosied up on sofas, exchanging propositions and clear plastic baggies before disappearing off towards the darkrooms or VIP tables. The mood would be playful, euphoric, full of intrigue; they were all so uninhibited and gorgeous, or that was what it looked like. They also seemed to be having a lot more fun than Anna and Tom.

And when the moment passed they would still be thinking about that fun, as they lay wrapped up in their cosy bathrobes or nestled under the herringbone blanket, breathing in each other’s smell. They couldn’t put their finger on exactly what it was they craved, but they knew it was very different to what they had. An entire erotic world lay just out of reach, closed off to them – so closed off that they couldn’t even say what it was that they were missing. They were happy with their sex life, and when they talked about it they said as much, and believed it. In a way, this was what was so suspicious. They worried they were content merely being contented.

They knew any dissatisfaction they felt wasn’t owing to how long they’d been together, or to their relative lack of sexual experience when they met. Polyamory wasn’t for them – and not only because their friends’ exploits made it seem like a bureaucratic and ultimately humiliating arrangement, but because they were good together. They understood each other, liked each other, and if ever they did let each other down, it was usually over something minor and foreseeable. They felt rather pathetic being so comfortable with long-term monogamy, but the truth was they were rarely attracted to other people, and even then it was always fleeting. They would point those people out to each other in bars or at parties, but it never went further than spinning fantasies they’d later play out in bed. They wouldn’t have wanted to experiment with anyone else: they could never have felt the same level of trust, the same openness to play. And they were reassured by this fact, but at the same time disheartened by it.

Every once in a while, they would buy a toy. One of them would read a piece by a New York journalist about how she’d taught her boyfriend to use a double strap-on, and then send the affiliate link to the other over Slack. Or they would be seduced by a professional quality video made by some influencer demonstrating a clitoral stimulator on a citrus fruit. On their walks they would find themselves drawn to the refined minimalism of new sex shops, such a far cry from the flashy, lurid feel to the ones back home. Of course they would go in, attracted like moths to a flame by the neon lights glowing between those white plasterboard walls. They would wander around the displays, hyperaware of the sales assistant’s presence, playing at being the kind of couple who knew enough about vibrators to compare them. They would loiter for a few minutes, relishing that image of themselves even if it didn’t really suit them. Then, more than anything to curb the feeling that they were imposters, they would buy something: a travel rabbit or a cock ring or some sustainably-produced lube made with CBD oil.

They used those purchases rarely, and never for long enough for their awkwardness to relax into spontaneity. Once they had removed it from its packaging, charged and washed it, they would leave their new toy in plain sight on the bedside table, where they would eye it uneasily for a couple of days until the next time one of them reached over for a condom and thought: why not? They weren’t embarrassed – together they laughed at their inexperience, guided each other – but their awkwardness prevented them from really enjoying those toys: the harness would be either too loose or so tight their leg went dead; the bullet would get stuck in the silicone and they would have to squeeze it out to reach the button. The buzzing would put them off their stride. And the constant questioning – were they using it correctly, was it all going as it was supposed to – far from opening up new possibilities, dampened their pleasure. The stimulation made Anna come quickly, but in truth she preferred Tom going down on her, because she thought that was what Tom preferred. Tom was into the idea of a plug, but whenever they tried it, it hurt too much. After showering, they would clean their new purchase with a special disinfectant to be used a few more times, at ever longer intervals, until finally they would put it away in the tin on Anna’s side of the bed with all the other toys that radiated waves of dissatisfaction over their bed.

Every so often those waves would propel them towards a sex club. It was never planned. They might be in a taxi heading home from a party that had ended too early, and as they waited at the lights on Heinrich-Heine-Straße, their eyes would be caught by a gate with a queue stretching all the way around the block. Or they might have a few drinks over dinner and get turned on by a scene in a film, or by the conversation, or just because, and it would be a Friday or Saturday and they’d say to themselves: Why not? It didn’t happen often.

And so they would find themselves in line, surrounded by tattooed and half-naked bodies in the freezing cold: people in skin-tight latex tube dresses, fishnet tops, plugs, studs, leather chokers, fluorescent wigs, leotards, high heels, garters. Next to them, Anna and Tom would feel very plain, but also turned on. Once again, they would promise themselves they would go out and buy something suitable for the dress code. But they never had any trouble getting past the door, because they were a couple and looked sufficiently cool and weren’t too high and could mutter something in passable German. Once inside that throbbing semi-darkness, they would immediately head for the bar, then dance together in stilted, jerking moves until they felt drunk and brave enough to move over to the poolside sofas or the mezzanine floor where people would lounge around smoking. From there they would look around.

Eventually a single guy or couple would approach the pair of them, or a woman might give Anna the eye. All the women had dilated pupils and all the men had hair matted with wax and sweat. They would chat in English, say a little about themselves, how long they’d been in Berlin, whether they were a couple, open or closed, straight or bi. Anna and Tom always said bi, even though he had never been with a man and she only once with a woman, with Tom also there: they’d sent her home, apologizing, straight after, and Anna never called the number she found in her pocket the next morning.

The propositions would inevitably come: a word whispered in an ear would become a little suck on an earlobe, or a friendly hand on a shoulder would slide down into a caress. Shins rubbed against shins, fingers interlaced, a pair of knees would part almost imperceptibly. The music would drum in their heads, and through the smoke and strobe lights everyone seemed interesting and mysterious. Anna and Tom would exchange a look. The air would smell of sweat and tobacco, of sugar and disinfectant. Their hearts would be beating both faster and slower.

It was hard to say why they didn’t ever end up doing anything. The urge they felt in those moments was very strong, blinding – whether it was desire or more a desire to desire – but every time, without fail, something stopped them. It could be the middle-aged man who followed them to watch, or the sobbing and moaning of the woman teetering on the edge of a k-hole. Tom could be put off by the sight of a half-limp dick blossoming from a cock ring. For Anna it could be someone going in to kiss her collarbone too roughly; she would recoil from the smell of musk and secretions and a scratchy beard, and feel very far away. Seen on their own, those moments of hesitation in the chill-out area or darkroom were perfectly legitimate, but together they represented something more: a vague sense of shame that they couldn’t put their finger on but that was always lurking, ready to make itself felt. They would return to the dancefloor with the excuse of needing a drink, or sometimes without any excuse at all.

Despite almost crossing the threshold several times, in the end they always found themselves back in line for the coat room. They would be tired and smelly, but their unease would fade the second they stepped out into the cool night air. If a taxi passed they might hail it. Otherwise they would walk home in the grey light of dawn, hands clasped, exhilarated, unified. And also, in truth, relieved to have spared themselves the STD tests, glad they hadn’t accepted those water bottles, baggies and vials. Once in bed, their excitement would soften into tenderness. They would spoon under the covers, let their breathing fall in sync and tell themselves that no sex party could ever be a match for the intimacy and gratification of that closeness.

In the morning that thought would seem pathetic."

    "text": "The old man was old, although hale and hearty. He lived beside a pond, where a large scholar tree bloomed with white flowers at the door to the house, and behind the building, purple perilla and sunchokes grew in a large vegetable plot that didn’t need tending. We often went to steal his sunchokes to pickle and eat. We, Little Camel and I, thought that, anyhow, the old man couldn’t eat so many, and in truth the old man never interfered even when he discovered us stealing his vegetables.

The old man had moved in many years after retirement. The black brick house he lived in had been empty before. When I was six or seven years old, I’d often gone to play there because the door was never locked. Little Camel and I called it the ‘Bird House’. The birds had flown in through the windows without glass in them. They had a surprising crest shaped like a fan on their heads. At first there were two of them making a nest on top of the large, ancient cupboard. Soon they became six. We only stayed in the house briefly and fixed the front door shut with a piece of bamboo when we left. We were afraid other little kids would get in and make a mess. I remember that the nestlings had just grown up when the birds all abandoned the nest. They probably sensed hidden danger.

Little Camel and I were two boys growing up together, our hobbies and interests fundamentally the same. We’d take any excuse to go to the empty house to rest up, chat, and sometimes hide our treasures. We sat on that high-up table for eight, swinging our legs and talking about strange and wonderful things. For years we took the empty house to be our own. Then one day this old man moved into it. I don’t know whether he took the empty house by force, or if the owners of our shipyard let him move in. We’d gone to his house and asked him, but he didn’t answer or even look at us. He appeared to be deaf. That day we saw how he’d already swept the rooms clean, spread tidy blue-patterned sheets on the bed, and hung a fishing rod on the wall. At the time I thought, too bad, he’ll catch all the fish from the pond. But we never saw him fishing there. He always put the fishing rod and bamboo basket on his back at dusk and went to a place called ‘Long Pond’, only returning home the next morning carrying his haul. Little Camel and I both believed the life of this deaf old man to be infinitely happy.

‘Butterfly,’ (this is the name my parents chose for me), Little Camel said, ‘that house is a blessed nest. Just think about how happy we were inside it. How can it have fallen into this old man’s hands? Not even the ghosts or the spirits know. He’s crafty and must have secret plans.’

I felt like Little Camel was making too much of a fuss. A house with no owner, that no one wanted, that by chance someone had taken a liking to. This kind of thing must happen all the time. It didn’t mean we should covet the old man. What’s more, we kept stealing his sunchokes. From the expression on Little Camel’s face, though, it wasn’t so much envying the old man as trying to enter some realm of his.

We frequently have lightning strikes where we live, and sometimes people are scorched by them. I noticed that the old man didn’t care about this kind of natural disaster, which could have been because he was deaf and simply didn’t hear. When it thundered in summer, he sat at the open door to the house with a palm-leaf fan in his hand. No matter the streaks of snow-white lightning cutting across the sky, one thunderclap after another above his roof, his eyes didn’t even blink. He waved the fan and drank his strong tea as usual. Little Camel wanted to copy the old man’s style and chose to stand, hands on hips, under the large scholar tree at the doorway during the thunder and lightning. Tragically, he was struck, and as a result still limps on his left leg.

‘This was my coming-of-age ceremony,’ Little Camel said with a grin. ‘I can’t say how joyful that instant was.’

I thought my friend was exaggerating. Why go looking for trouble where there was none? Had he had enough of life?

 

My interest was the fishing the old man got up to. I’d heard that there were many stream fish in Long Pond, but the locals didn’t allow outsiders to fish at their riverside. I supposed that he was related to a family from there, so he could count as someone from Long Pond. I thought it would be great if I could pass myself off as his grandson and go there to fish secretly. I thought about this so much that one day I actually did it.

He and I set out at dusk, separated by two or three hundred meters, walking the road in unison. I also had a fishing rod and a fish basket on my back, along with a sleeping bag, because I planned on sleeping by the river at night.

Walking almost fifteen kilometers without stopping didn’t seem tiring when I was so excited and full of expectations. The sky was already dimming by the time we reached Long Pond. I saw the old man walking toward where there were houses, probably to his relatives’ home. As for me, I carefully scouted the riverside, found a fairly comfortable site, then started to put out my fishing pole. My hands shook as I imagined the scene of many fish biting. I heard someone calling to me from the dark:

‘Butterfly – Butterfly!’

It was a boy, much smaller than me, who pushed his way out of the bushes.

‘Uncle Feng wanted me to come tell you that you need to go right back home. Otherwise you could die.’

Uncle Feng must be the old man’s name. How’d he know I had followed him?

‘Little brother, why would I die?’

‘There are no fish in this lake, except a fish that eats people,’ he said.

Aha, the child was lying. Everyone knew there were numerous fish in Long Pond. One of my friends had secretly come here and caught fish. Seeing that I wasn’t going to leave, the boy spat on the ground scornfully and went away.

How exactly had deaf Uncle Feng known I was here? I had kept so far from him on the way, and he hadn’t turned back the whole time to look at me. Why was he trying to intimidate me, instead of letting me fulfill my wish? It wouldn’t damage his interests if I caught fish once or twice.

I calmed down and fished. The sky was dark, a sandy wind blew, and there was not a single soul nearby. Before long I caught a fish on the line. I shone my flashlight on it. Ha, it was a koi fish! I am afraid of spirits, but my addiction to fishing took the upper hand. I’d started and might as well finish, satisfying my craving even if it meant being snatched away by ghosts. After a while I caught another koi. Really quite strange that there were so many koi in the river. Where we live koi are precious. Another while passed, and I felt the line go taut. I forcefully pulled it up, and there was another koi, a big one! This time I felt overjoyed.

I decided if I caught ten koi then I would go right back home.

But my good luck seemed to run out. For a long, long time, I sat in the same place.

An unfamiliar voice came from the bushes. My whole body shivered.

‘Butterfly, you bad boy, aren’t you afraid of dying?’

‘Who are you?’

‘I’m Uncle Feng. There is a piranha in this river that eats people. It’s already heading toward here.’

‘Good to meet you, Uncle Feng. I’ll stay on the riverbank. How can the piranha be a threat to me?’

‘It’s still dangerous on the riverbank. You’re in peril even if you stay inside a house. This is Long Pond, the home of the piranha.’

I gathered up my fishing rod, intending to go with him. I am afraid of dying. But Uncle Feng told me not to look to him for help, he didn’t have anywhere he could go tonight either and would have to wander around the village. I said I wanted to go home.

‘What an imagination!’ he scoffed. ‘You’ve gone fishing in Long Pond. Do you think you can just leave? I don’t think the consequences for your actions bode well.’

‘Then I’ll go with you and wander around the village.’

Without saying a word, he turned around and left the shore. I stared at the old man’s dark figure, striding after him anxiously at a distance of six or seven meters. There were dogs barking and a rooster crowing, making it seem like daybreak amid a village seething with life. But it was the middle of the night now. I had a sudden impulse, so I shouted:

‘Uncle Feng, I love you! Me and Little Camel, we worship you! Are you listening?’

I don’t know whether he heard me. He didn’t turn his head as he walked. In my flustered state I had left my sleeping bag in the bushes, but I was reluctant to go looking for it. I needed to follow Uncle Feng closely now. I watched him disappear into a haystack up ahead. I hurriedly ran over, shouting ‘Uncle Feng!’, and tunneled into the haystack. There was a space inside, but he wasn’t in this burrow, so I came back out. There were two people with their backs to me.

‘Tonight the river isn’t too peaceful. It’s been a long time since anything happened,’ one of them said.

‘Will there be an uprising? I feel like I’ve been waiting for this day,’ the other said.

Next they also started shouting, ‘Uncle Feng! Uncle Feng!’ He didn’t answer. The one who’d spoken first asked whether they’d been hoodwinked by Uncle Feng, then said the old fellow wanted ‘to raise a flood surge in the Long Pond river’. Talking away the two of them grew panicked and tunneled into the hole inside the haystack. I regretted having given over that refuge in the straw to them, because now I didn’t have anywhere to rest. All around there were no other haystacks, the houses were dark, their doors and windows shut tight. Now I finally felt how tired I was. I put down the fish basket and fishing rod, sitting down right where I was. There was patchy grass growing on the ground, but sparsely, not enough to make myself comfortable. I heard the large koi inside the basket jumping around for its life. The basket jumped along with it. I was reluctant to take care of it, and anyhow it couldn’t jump out, just flop around. I might as well lie down and sleep. I glanced into the dim sky and soon started to dream. That fish basket leapt all the way through my dreams, seeming to grow legs and bound away into the distance. I knew it was a dream and continued to dream.

The sky was still black even when I woke from my deep sleep. The nights really are long in Long Pond. I looked down at the ground and didn’t see my basket of fish. It really had run away. What strange kind of fish were they? But also, maybe those two people in the haystack had stolen them? Oh, how had I managed to fall dead asleep!

I sensed there was real danger here. I had willfully gone fishing in the Long Pond river, and the fish I’d caught weren’t fish, but seemed instead to be immortal animals. Even stranger things might still happen. The two people inside the haystack were fighting so hard that it rocked severely. After a while, the large pile started moving forward as if it, too, had grown legs. Why were the people and animals here so violent? I needed to leave right away, from this place where anything might happen. I would busy myself looking around, since there was nowhere to stay. Make it until dawn, then go home.

I hadn’t gotten very far when I saw Uncle Feng. He looked troubled, but I was happy.

‘Uncle Feng, you’re here at last! But my fish ran away.’

‘Don’t worry over those couple of fish. They’ve gone back to the river. It’s been too frightening since you came and started fishing.’ Uncle Feng remembered something, then asked me: ‘Was it you who brought him over here?’

I looked in the direction he was pointing, where someone sat beside the river. The closer I went, the more I felt sure that it was Little Camel.

Had he trailed me here? It could be. I should have anticipated this.

Uncle Feng made a gesture for me to be quiet. He walked to the riverbank, bent down, and shifted something. Then I heard an enormous sound as the water in the river splashed over three meters high. An enormous black form rose from the water. Uncle Feng told me in a low voice to run fast. He and I fled from the scene together. When I stopped beside the haystack to catch my breath, I immediately thought of Little Camel, remembering that he was in danger.

‘Where are you going?’ Uncle Feng said sternly. ‘Your friend won’t be in danger. Just now I was giving the piranha a warning. It already went back into the river depths.’

‘Thank you, Uncle Feng!’

‘Hmph, I wasn’t trying to do a good deed! Little Camel wanted to show off being a hero, and I had to disappoint him. Just the same as you. Are you disappointed now?’

Was I disappointed? My fish had run away, and I hadn’t braved a dangerous experience; I’d merely slept on the muddy ground at the side of the road. Should I be disappointed by this? I wasn’t sure. Maybe only Uncle Feng knew about this kind of thing.

I went into the cavernous space inside the haystack to look around. The sky was still dark, so I told Uncle Feng to come inside the haystack with me to rest. He said this was actually a good idea.

But after Uncle Feng went into the burrow he disappeared. Alone, I sat down on the fresh rice straw, which was quite comfortable. After a while, someone else felt their way inside. I knew who it was. I was angry with him.

‘Butterfly, I only followed you because I love you,’ Little Camel said uneasily.

‘Love, what’s love! I think you’re looking for death!’

‘I guess so. But isn’t it the same for you? This place is beautiful! I sat beside the river, the piranha bit my hook – that kind of feeling, that feeling . . .’

Little Camel seemed to be immersed in wild imaginations. Long Pond, what was this place exactly? When I laid down on the straw, I felt that I liked it here. Yet the sky was about to grow light, and once it was bright Little Camel and I must hurry back home. This was Uncle Feng’s rule.

Little Camel was making a noise with something in the dark. I asked him what it was.

‘It’s your fish basket, I picked it up for you. That koi inside tossed the empty basket to me,’ he said.

‘They were all spirit fish. I was rash to go fishing for them.’

Hearing me say this, Little Camel laughed dryly twice. Had he also rashly gone fishing for the fish that ate people? Or had he planned it out ahead? Hadn’t he been imitating Uncle Feng all along?

‘They call him Uncle Feng,’ I added.

‘Oh.’

Little Camel was withdrawn. He didn’t want to share his worries with me, or maybe he thought the excitement he was feeling couldn’t be shared.

We heard dogs barking in the village and also the rooster. This place was so lively. Before, when I was at home, every time I had mentioned wanting to go to Long Pond to my parents, I was met with mocking laughter. They said that Long Pond was ‘a poor place where even birds won’t shit’. If I went there the poor people would steal the clothes off me and send me back naked. My parents seemed terrified of Long Pond, but why? What did they think of Uncle Feng? They had never divulged this. Little Camel’s family knew he was copying Uncle Feng, but they didn’t stop him. Now Little Camel and I had both been to Long Pond, I’d had experience with genuine Long Pond people, and they hadn’t done anything sinister to me.

‘Butterfly, what do you think of this place?’ Little Camel finally spoke up.

‘I like it here. Let’s come back again once very week.’

‘I agree. I didn’t tell you just now, I actually touched the piranha before Uncle Feng came.’

‘Wow!’ I cried out in surprise.

‘It got so close to me that its mouth almost reached my face. I could smell its fishy breath. I don’t know why, but I liked the smell. I’ve been remembering that odor, it seems to have incredible magic . . .’

‘Oh, Little Camel,’ I sighed to myself. ‘What’s going on with you?’

The dogs had stopped barking, and the rooster had ceased crowing. How strange. We left the haystack and entered dazzling daylight. Both our fish baskets were empty.

Reaching the road, we walked in the direction of home.

 

I had been back for three days and was still having nightmares about the fish that ate people. After the third night, I finally couldn’t stand it and went to visit Uncle Feng.

Uncle Feng was cooking in the house, filling the rooms with smoke. I patiently stood outside until he finished. The meal was set on the table, the fumes in the room thinning. His single dish spread the scent of fish, an odor that made me think of Little Camel coming face to face with the piranha.

‘Uncle Feng, what are you eating today?’

‘Something dredged out of Long Pond river – what else could it be?’

He spoke to me; he was no longer silent. This made me really happy. I thought about how he, and also Little Camel, believed this fish odor to be the most beautiful smell in the world. To preserve the flavor, he hadn’t even added purple perilla.

The house grew dark, with only a small oil lamp lit on the dining table, its feeble light illuminating Uncle Feng’s bowl of food. I thought I saw the pieces of fish in the bowl pulsating, so I blinked and leaned in closer.

‘It’s not worth looking. They’re all small fish, no bigger than shrimp,’ Uncle Feng said.

‘Fish that eat people?’ I asked softly.

‘Yes, you’re bright enough.’

Uncle Feng ate quickly, finishing the fish in the bowl. He sat there satisfied, like he was going to take a nap. His right hand waved back and forth. Finally, I made out two words: ‘Little Camel.’

‘What about Little Camel?’ I rapidly asked.

‘Little Camel put the fish hatchlings in the pond at the door,’ he replied in a clear voice. ‘He put them there yesterday.’

‘Oh. Is he experimenting?’

‘No. He wants to give himself a sense of crisis.’

I fell silent. I was remembering Little Camel’s expression. He was already on his way, my friend. This was to say, he no longer had to run to Long Pond every few days. I knew he wouldn’t have been able to resist the allure of the river, if he hadn’t thought up this trick. Ah, the young of the piranha! I imagined what the pond would look like crowded with them.

I ran into Little Camel on the road. I surprised him, because he was worrying to himself.

‘Where are you going?’ I asked.

‘I was looking for you. Butterfly, don’t go home, come sleep by the pond with me. I’ve put two bamboo beds there. We’ll have a lot of fun.’

‘Fun doing what? Listening to the fish sing songs in the pond?’

‘Yes! But how did you know?’

We went to sleep on the bamboo beds. Uncle Feng knew we were out by the pond, but he didn’t come outside.

It was pleasant. Little Camel, what a supernaturally clever child – only he would have thought of this idea. We didn’t talk, because we knew the silence of our surroundings was hiding something.

There was disturbance from the depths of the pond, then there came the faint sound of singing. The singing made my whole body tremble. Then I heard that I was singing.

‘What song is that?’ Little Camel asked in a low voice.

I didn’t answer him. I didn’t know what I was singing, but I couldn’t keep from doing so. My song was somewhat like the song of the piranhas. Yet I also felt that they weren’t singing, that it was just me singing.

‘Butterfly, you sing really well.’ Little Camel’s words were heartfelt. ‘I didn’t know you could sing like this.’

‘No, I’ve never sung before,’ I said. ‘What song do you hear me singing?’

Once I asked, it was his turn to be silent. We both heard Uncle Feng coughing with effort from inside the house. The pond became quiet when he coughed. Had the piranhas actually been singing or not? The sound of Uncle Feng’s coughing made me remember something that had happened last year.

Back then he was digging up sunchokes from that piece of land behind the house. I saw him laboring and felt a little ashamed – I thought I should go help him dig. But I also didn’t dare, after all, we’d stolen away the better part of the sunchokes. He’d really seemed not to mind our pilfering. Maybe he actually didn’t like them? But he dug energetically, then suddenly there was a glittering thing turned up by the large lumps of roots. A gold bar. I rapidly fled when he bent over to pick it up. I’d thought, Uncle Feng really has good luck. Then I thought, Maybe he buried the gold bar himself? Why would he bury a gold bar in the ground? What if someone else dug it up and took it? All along the road I thought back and forth about this without understanding. Later Little Camel invited me to the rec room at the shipyard office to play ping-pong.

‘Uncle Feng dug up a gold bar from the ground!’ I couldn’t help saying.

‘Hmm. I saw him bury it,’ Little Camel said.

‘What was he doing burying a gold bar in the dirt?’

‘To give himself a nice surprise. You, you always have to dig to the bottom of things!’

This time I even suspected Little Camel and Uncle Feng were teaming up together. But that couldn’t be. I knew Little Camel too well, he was the same as me and had never spoken with Uncle Feng before. But what had he surmised about Uncle Feng?

Lying in the cool breeze at the edge of the pond, watching the grey-black of the firmament above, I sensed how miniscule I was. This negligible ‘me’ was also anxious. There were so many pleasures that I hadn’t yet enjoyed and that I didn’t know how to find. Little Camel was the one who knew these things; he had many methods. I needed to watch his every move closely and no longer act alone.

‘Little Camel, I want to give myself a nice surprise every day.’

‘Oh, then you should learn from Uncle Feng.’

His words were too vague. How could I imitate Uncle Feng? I didn’t have any idea what he was thinking!

‘You don’t need to speculate about him. Copying how he walks would be enough,’ Little Camel added.

What did Uncle Feng look like when he walked? I regretted not having noticed. I’d believed that all old people looked about the same. Little Camel could see the differences though!

The fish in the pond made ambiguous sounds again, probably because Uncle Feng had stopped coughing. Fish, ah, fish, I said to myself, you are also looking for pleasure. Little Camel brought you here to give himself a nice surprise every day. You and he are like an old cucumber on a vine . . .

‘You’re talking nonsense!’ Little Camel scolded me.

‘How do you know what I’m thinking?’ I asked, astonished.

‘My fish tell me.’

‘No wonder you had me lie down by the pond. You’re as smart as Uncle Feng.’

‘Hee hee.’

I calmed down, no longer thinking about this mess of things. I listened very carefully. But the piranhas weren’t singing, and the sounds they made couldn’t be understood. Only Little Camel could understand them. Just at this instant, the moment when I was listening to the piranhas, I remembered what Uncle Feng looked like when he walked, as a clear image. I was pleased with myself.

The sound of Uncle Feng’s voice reached me when I was about to go to sleep. He seemed to have moved closer, but I couldn’t see him. I tried hard struggling to keep awake.

‘Butterfly, Little Camel, you two bad boys, are you sleeping at my doorway to teach me a lesson? Or are you trying to seize power and take over? I’m warning you, I’m not all that old. I’m like ginger that gets spicier as it ages!’

Was this a threat? My eyelids were stuck together, and it took a lot of energy to open them. Once I got my eyes open, I still didn’t see Uncle Feng. Where was he speaking from? Did Little Camel hear him? To get a clearer idea, I went ahead and sat up. The noise I made disturbed Little Camel.

‘Butterfly, what are you doing? I just went to sleep and you woke me up.’

‘Uncle Feng was here. Do you know where he is?’

‘He always comes. He just sits by the pond, in the shallow part. I want to go to sleep.’

Little Camel turned over and went back to sleep. It seemed like he had a big heart and didn’t care whether there was any threat.

I tiptoed toward the shallow part of the pond, where I saw Uncle Feng sitting in the water and smoking, the ember flashing.

‘Look, they’re here,’ Uncle Feng turned his head and said to me in a friendly way. ‘They all came here for me! I told you I’m not too old. Doesn’t this prove it?’

He held my arm and asked me to sit in the water, too.

I’d just sat down when my right foot was bitten. I gave a heart-rending cry and almost fainted.

‘Don’t worry, Butterfly, bear it a bit and you’ll be fine. These little guys, they’re finding their relatives. Your blood lets them recognize you. Their welcome ceremony is a little reckless.’

Now Uncle Feng and I sat down on the dry ground beside the pond. Little Camel came over to sit with us. The sole of my foot still hurt a bit, but it seemed the wound wasn’t so deep. I felt ashamed.

Little Camel pled with Uncle Feng to tell us the story of the fish that ate people.

‘Piranhas have never had stories,’ Uncle Feng said simply.

‘Was it there before you went to Long Pond?’ Little Camel asked.

‘No one had seen it before I went to Long Pond.’

‘It appeared once you went there?’ Little Camel said excitedly, his words accelerating.

‘Yes, that’s just it. It recognized me.’

Oh, oh! To my surprise, such things really happened! I trembled again, thinking back on being bitten. Uncle Feng and Little Camel were longing for this! They were making where we were into another Long Pond, so that they wouldn’t need to run along over there. This was Little Camel’s mysterious idea. When had he started to have such affinity with Uncle Feng?

The sky brightened, and the pond was very still. Uncle Feng wanted me and Little Camel to take the bamboo beds away, saying it ‘bothers me to see them’.

We moved them back to Little Camel’s house, where his mom laughed at us and said: ‘It’s like the toad trying to eat the swan.’

Little Camel didn’t want to listen to his mother’s chattering and went out with me.

‘Little Camel, what are you thinking about?’

‘I’m thinking about my hatchlings. Butterfly, if something happens to me, will you help me take care of them?’

‘What could happen?’

‘I don’t know. It’s what my mother said. Because when I do things I’m reckless. Tell me, will you?’ he asked earnestly.

‘Isn’t it just cutting grass to feed them? Of course I will! I promise –’

‘Don’t promise, don’t! Promises are dangerous.’

‘But I don’t understand.’

Little Camel pointed ahead. I saw a boy standing under a pomelo tree. He looked a lot like the child I’d met in Long Pond. I walked closer and asked him whether he was from there. He spat on the ground and ran away swiftly. I heard Little Camel say: ‘Oh no.’

‘What’s wrong?’

‘That kid is a spy. He’s discovered that I stole their hatchlings.’ Little Camel frowned.

‘He shouldn’t be able to cause trouble for you. Last time he predicted I would die. Aren’t I fine?’

‘Hmm. But no one knows for sure. He’s relentless, this child. I even like him.’

After saying goodbye to Little Camel, I passed by Uncle Feng’s home again. He was lying under the tree at the entrance smoking, the old deckchair making creaking sounds under him. He looked pleased.

‘There’s a little boy –’

Uncle Feng waved a hand to interrupt me.

‘You’re talking about Little Ox. He’s inside my house, he’ll be staying here. He says he won’t go because he wants to take care of the fish. Oh, this boy changes his mind so easily. Kids today, their minds are so lively. Nothing like in the past.’

I became more carefree than ever before once I thought of how the boy had come to help Little Camel take care of the fish. Now there were four of us. Four people busy at a cause. Every day interesting things would happen, every day would be full – but why did Little Camel worry that something would happen? He’d said that it was because he was reckless, but I was more and more convinced that he was scheming. He was becoming more like Uncle Feng. Oh, I remembered the day of the thunderstorm when he’d stood under the scholar tree at the doorway forging his courage, then being struck by lightning. I really was too far behind in comparison. This Little Camel, he wasn’t reckless after all. He could almost be called a conspirator!

That night I lay in bed thinking about the problem of Little Camel, thinking of our friendship, thinking of our different ways of doing things, thinking so much that I couldn’t get to sleep. I felt that I had realized something, and I was a little happy, because this was what Uncle Feng expected of me. Lately the happenings around the pond had been so thrilling.

Eventually I went to sleep. Everything was dim in my dreams, with only a few shadows in the surroundings. These shadows were familiar to me. The shadows and I squatted beside the pond listening, and I was filled with excitement."

but I am even prouder to call myself my father’s reader
The books he wrote

The vanguard literature that Dad persisted against all odds in creating was an incitement

‘Would you mind putting that away,’ the flight attendant said, ‘we’re getting the cabin ready for departure,’ and Acker left off his shaky typing and shut his computer and stowed it in the pocket of his business-class pod and as the plane got in line for takeoff, as the plane sped and lifted and rose up through the sky, it was as if all his thoughts were left behind on the ground except: I’ve fucked up badly.

The festival dedicated to his late father was scheduled to open tomorrow evening on the Mediterranean island of Midorca and the evening after that Acker was set to present his remarks at the Biblioteca Pública de Midorca. It would be the festival’s main speech, the organizers had told him, it would be the keynote address, the organizers were seeking his permission to record it, and yet most of what he’d managed to write of it so far was this beginning: ‘I’m proud to call myself my father’s son, but even prouder . . .’

From there, he had a few stunted anecdotes that he could use to wing his way through the lecture’s middle, as he’d been winging his way through the middle of his life, but as for an ending, he had none, he had no hope of one: ‘I’d like to take this opportunity to thank –’ is not an ending.

His intention had been to finish a draft in transit, to use all this dead delayed time otherwise wasted waiting between flights and on flights to pressure his jumbled troubled filial notions into a more final respectable form – sensitive, intelligent, did he mention respectable – but drinking vodka sodas high above clouds that looked like tiny brains or like the tiny pills currently seeping into his brain, he was suddenly too woozy and drunk to get anything done and instead of trying to type any more under such slurry conditions he spent most of the flight out of Newark sitting plugged into some trash on his swivel-mounted screen, wallowing in the watching of a popular superhero franchise, watching the original and then the sequel and then the rest of the installments, but somehow, unsuspectingly, watching them out of order.

‘– a refill?’

‘What?’

‘– ice?’

‘What?’

‘Would you like another drink,’ the flight attendant had to yell, ‘and would you like it with ice?’

If this were a scene in one of his father’s (classic, vanguard) books, it would’ve been written this way: the main character, drunk and pilled, self-loathing, self-disgusted, gross and gassy and distinctly un-sober, would be watching ‘a popular superhero franchise’, but since this isn’t fiction but reality, we can say that Acker, failing to complete his remarks, was wrecked on Ketel One and Ambien and watching all the Batmans. He’d fucked up badly. He’d known about this festival honoring his late father for about a year now and he’d known about his late father’s hundredth birthday for – about a hundred years now? And yet despite having had all that warning to prepare, he was flying to the occasion equipped with just a few weak memories of youth, none of the emotional ones really emotional and none of the intellectual ones really intellectual, along with a trite diatribe against identity politics and cultural illiteracy in what he thought was his father’s style, which wasn’t really in his father’s style. A sad-because-too-revealing account of this one summer day together when his father showed him how to polish shoes (and then gave him a half-dozen pairs to polish and left him to it). A sad-because-too-revealing attempt to turn that polishing account into a metaphor (for what?). Short sketches of his father as a bad driver and swimmer, a lugubrious if dubious description of his adolescent drift from his father that tended to flatter himself in accounts of his flirtations with one of his father’s young girlfriends in Sicily and of his sexual experiences with another of his father’s young girlfriends on Crete, along with an embittered sour section – one that should be the ending, but could not be the ending – about what it was like to grow up on Midorca and then leave, when his mother left and took him with her back to the States, leaving his father behind to write the books that helped make him and the island famous.

About a decade ago, his father had returned to Midorca after picking up one major literary prize or another and, as the press coverage went, the moment he’d entered the house and set the award atop the only empty shelf in the crowded alcove reserved for trophies, diplomas, and other such encomia, he’d suffered a stroke and died. He was buried in a grave high up on the cemetery cliff above the sea and eulogized by old rich hippies and celebrity friends who flew in, name-brand painters and singer-songwriters along with investment bankers and property developers, while he, the dead man’s son, had stayed behind in honking New York to care for his ailing mother. She could not be left alone. If he’d left her alone that winter in cruel and brutally cold New York to fly to his father’s funeral in Midorca, the heavy traffic of nurses and doctors would have told her where he was, and she would’ve keened and raged and ripped the tubes and wires straight out of her havocked body and dropped dead on the spot, the way his father had, as opposed to what happened, which was that her consciousness continued to flicker and fade until she passed away peacefully just a few days later.

His father died on a Monday, his mother died on a Friday, something like that, and the more extensive weekend-edition obituaries of Geoffrey Acker – ‘the author of acclaimed volumes that skewered capitalist pieties’ (the Times), ‘who chronicled the Americanization of Europe and the banalization of America’ (the Guardian) – went on to note in an update that his first wife had outlived him only briefly.

 

Acker had never gotten along with his father – the man who everyone meant when they said ‘Acker’, even the man he himself meant when he said ‘Acker’. He was the first son of his father’s first wife. He was the only son actually, the only child actually, of the first wife of two. There were also three biographers, five translators, and about a dozen dazed shambolic scholars from Europe, all gathered together in Zurich, specifically in Zurich Airport, specifically in a small, neglected terminal from which the smaller budget flights departed on airlines that shouldn’t exist, airlines that didn’t exist, special charters with nonsensical names and non-sequitur logos that kept changing. Something called EUsky with a winged cow. Something called Flingling with a bubble font in fire colors. The gate for MidAir (represented by a palm tree whose fronds were also whirring rotors, its lettering proto-Phoenician) was at the end of the farthest hall, a dingy, gray-carpeted, bathroom-less and café-less mustering point that slowly, gradually, over the torporous course of the day, became populated by experts, academics, men (mostly men) just shy of emeritus age, who seemed to all know one another personally or at least by reputation and greeted one another with stern handshakes (the Germans) and hugs and kisses (the French and Francophiles) and traded witty quotations in flavorfully accented English of favorite lines of the work of the man whose posterity had brought them together (‘over the torporous course of the day’). Some had been waiting for hours already and were relieved to finally have others around to complain to, the jet-lagged others who were just showing up on flights from Mexico City, Hong Kong, and Seoul. There was one flight a day from Zurich to Midorca and apparently much of the festival would be on it. The director of the Acker documentary, who was due to be interviewed onstage after what would be the world premiere screening of the Acker documentary. The author of the passive-aggressive memoir about informally studying with and even serving as an informal secretary to ‘Geoffrey’, who kept referring to Acker’s father as ‘Geoffrey’, in print and in person, every chance he got. Acker was the last to arrive – last and late – even after the late-because-of-a-tardy-pilot flight from Los Angeles, and the late-because-of-a-volcano flights from Scandinavia. They’d been waiting for him, they were impatient for him, he could feel it. As he rolled his fancy metal-armored luggage down the hall toward the gate, he felt their eyes roll over him like wheels, and in his stomach, in his throat, he felt a trepid rising nausea. Here we go, he thought. Time to be the son and heir, the head of the estate, the gatekeeper of the flame, the flamekeeper of the gate, the standard-bearer of the Jesus Christ enough already. YES – you have the permission to quote such-and-such my father wrote about so-and-so. YES – you have the permission to reprint said text, to reproduce this photograph, that clip. But NO – you may not use any of those diary entries where the old graphomonster was overtly misogynistic (if only XXXX were as sweet as her sweet tits) or racist (it’s as if XXXX thinks he’s owed a living for having been born a poor and boorish African). Oh Dad! Oh Geoff ! It was time to be his face – there was a certain resemblance of uncertain chin, invariably remarked upon – time to be the interface for a group of people with their own relationships and stakes: people who had some claim to his father and then exaggerated the rest, people who’d exaggerated some claim and then imagined the rest. The scholars whose tenures were made out of interpretations of his father’s early novels or late novels or the increasingly detached and elitist political non-fiction the man wrote to mark the years in between; the leather-swaddled former Marxist who cared only about Acker as a former Marxist; the plump and wistful Jew who cared only about Acker as a Jew; the crunchy, dreadlocked Jamaican-Estonian who wrote that article on the ‘mirror inversion expatriate aesthetics’ of Acker and Nabokov; and the bald, gay, very fit cyclist from Amsterdam who’d brought his folding bike along with copies of the jargonated monograph he’d authored entitled ‘Hetero-conservative influences in the pseudo-radical novel: the cis/systems fictions of Geoffrey Acker’, which mined fatuous meanings out of fabulous misprints and derived wishful phallic inferences from every mode of transport – taxi, bus, train, horse – Acker’s heroes ever rode.

As the flight’s pilots and crew arrived harried gateside and commenced with their checks, Acker was introducing himself to people he’d forgotten he’d already met and being introduced to others with whom he’d hazily corresponded, trying to keep everyone straight and placated from among the swarm of frumpled necrologists he was going to be sequestered with for the next lauding week beachside and poolside at the over-starred resort where they were being put up, asking where was the guy who’d edited that collection of his father’s letters (Acker owed him an email) and where was the guy who was supposed to profile him and write about the festival for some magazine (Acker wasn’t quite sure which magazine and was eager to confirm the New Yorker)? ‘– but did anyone tell you about the pub at the resort?’ an academic from somewhere in Britain that wasn’t Oxford or Cambridge was saying. ‘A pub, bar and grill, called Acker’s – unclear if that was always the case or they’ve just renamed it after your dad for our event.’

Acker was considering joking about whether that meant he could drink and eat for free when an Aussie academic asked, ‘Have you been back since your father’s death?’

But before Acker could answer, some other professors around him were chiming in about how ‘the island’s changed a lot, like most things for the worse’ and ‘it’s become all touristy and commercialized now that it’s a stop for the cruise ships’ and ‘there’s really nothing left from the era of your parents, when that whole countercultural wave took the island by storm, I assume you’ve read the book by –’

‘I haven’t,’ Acker said, and though he was still answering that earlier question, saying that he hadn’t visited Midorca since his father’s passing, his father’s Portuguese translator thought Acker had meant that he hadn’t read the book he was recommending to him (which Acker hadn’t, anyway), the book he was offering to send to him (to which Acker nodded in a way that might’ve signified thanks, anyway).

A man who’d identified himself as ‘your father’s voice in Polish’, said, ‘I think they did a wonderful job, actually, converting your father’s house into that museum.’

‘Casa Acker,’ the Brit said. ‘They did an excellent job.’

‘And they’ve been keeping up the grave,’ the Aussie said. ‘I was there for the dedication of the monument.’

‘You know,’ said an Ackerite from Paris, ‘I did a fair amount of research and consulting for the museum when it opened, when I was working on my dissertation.’

‘If by research and consultation you mean a fair amount of shagging the staff and vacationing Danes, then sure, I’m sure you did,’ said an Ackerite from Frankfurt.

The acolytes stood clustered around the living son, breathing in the terminal’s stale, recirculated air and blowing it out again as one-upmanship and banter, while readying to queue for boarding, putting away into their backpacks their much-thumbed editions of his father’s books and cocking their pretentious straw hats and clutching the handles of their battered suitcases, as if their suitcases were canes or walkers – ambulatory assistive devices that just happened also to be luggage, plastered over with stickers advocating world peace and declaring affiliations with distinguished institutions of higher learning.

Already – so soon, too soon – Acker had the desire to flee, to run away, but it wouldn’t be that easy. The business class on this flight wasn’t true business class, at least not like it had been from Newark to Zurich, where he’d had that private capsule all to himself, replete with spinny screen and a seat that stretched and yawned out into a bed. Here, the business class that he’d requested from the organizers – that he’d demanded from the organizers, once his daughter had insisted he not relent and keep demanding – was just a seat up front, in the first row alongside the window where everyone boarding passed him and greeted him again and exchanged some words or a wave with him again and resented his extra legroom.

Along with the festival participants passing him, he also noted some regular tourists or people he took for regular tourists, retirees mostly, whose curiously pre-tanned faces had also been lifted and tightened in such a way that only emphasized their bafflement when they encountered these sloppy bookish creatures gibbering to one another and blocking the aisles: Aren’t we headed out on a golf and tennis and spa-massage holiday? Who are all these losers, trying to cram their book-stuffed schoolbags into the overhead bins?

Acker was seated by the window in the first row that was ostensibly business class with one empty seat next to him on the aisle and he kept watching that seat and watching the boarding passengers as they passed down the aisle and thinking to himself: please let me be seated here alone or please if it’s not my luck to be here alone then let me share this row with one of those older, surely husbandless ladies with the cleavage. He didn’t know who he was praying to and enjoyed for a moment pretending that he was praying to his father.

One of the biographers – not the author of the so-called academic biography and not the author of the so-called popular biography but the author of the so-called revisionist biography – sat down next to Acker in the empty seat, a woman who’d lambasted Acker’s father and criticized his ‘turn inward and rightward’, harangued him for his treatment of women ‘as shabby in fiction as in life’, pilloried him for his position or lack of position on the American civil rights movement, and just generally went after the man with the energy and conviction of someone who’d truly loved him and felt jilted, though it was unclear to Acker whether they’d ever actually slept together. She’s old now, Acker thought, she’s my age. ‘I always put in the request to sit either in an emergency-exit row or up front,’ the woman said, ‘because of my knee.’ Acker forced a smile and looked down at her knee. It looked normal below the stretchy jeans. Maybe a little puffy. Maybe her knee was a little swollen or she was wearing a brace. Acker didn’t want to ask her about her knee and neither did he want to talk about the biography she wrote that was being republished for his father’s centennial in a new edition, nor about any of the other subjects that the woman wanted to talk about, from the unfortunate circumstance that the biography was being republished by a worse publisher than had originally put it out (‘but these days the alternative to a bad publisher is no publisher at all’), to the sabotaging editor who wouldn’t let her incorporate any new changes or corrections (‘this time the errors aren’t on me’) and the delinquent publicity and marketing departments that had pretty much resigned themselves to the fact that the literature of Geoffrey Acker was unlikely to entice the interest of the younger generation (‘who spend all their time online, where you haven’t even digitized your father’s archives . . .’).

They were already airborne at this point – so insistent was the biographer’s patter that Acker had barely registered takeoff. He’d wanted to see Zurich from above but by the time the biographer had given him pause to look out the window, the city was already behind them. There was rain dribbling down the window and then they were up above the rain, where the air was bumpy. Acker said something about how talking on planes made him nauseous. The biographer couldn’t sit with her knee flexed for hours and Acker couldn’t talk on planes, or actually, he was explaining to her, while in any type of motion.

The biographer, abashed, tugged at her long white braid and apologized, and as Acker was assuring her there was really no need, a memory opened like a flower in his mind of this woman doing that very same apologetic braid-tugging years ago at his mother’s in New York: there had been some sort of Q&A his mother had consented to, either to advance her own agenda against her ex-husband’s reputation or merely because she herself wanted the attention, but one of the biographer’s Qs had rankled his mother who, instead of providing an A, had threatened to toss her out onto the street, and the biographer, in an attempt to wait out his mother’s rage, had said ‘sorry I’m so sorry’, and in the very same nervous anxious way had stroked and pinched and tugged at her long braid, which was black back then, not white, tugging at it like tugging at the rope that rings the bell at the church by the Midorca cemetery . . . and then what? Acker couldn’t remember the rest of that day . . . had Mom calmed down enough to let her stay?

The next time Acker turned from the window, the biographer was asleep, she was snoring, and then – despite the plane being cramping small and the flight being short and occasionally turbulent – he was also succumbing. It was the drinks, it was the pills, it was the cumulative social obligations along with the sudden realization that he’d been awake all night – his head was lolling just as the land beneath gave way to sea and his dreams turned watery too: his mother, years ago, giving him some lawyerly document to take when he went to meet his father for one of their island summers together, a document it was important that he get his father to sign and bring back, he couldn’t forget, but then he’d forgotten . . . his daughter just yesterday, which didn’t feel like just yesterday, dropping him off in manic, frigid Newark and telling him once again how guilty she felt that she couldn’t accompany him, although the truth was that she hadn’t been invited officially and he’d never invited her unofficially himself, and then her saying to him, ‘I know you didn’t ask me, but if you did ask me, I’d say you can’t go out and talk about Grandpa without admitting what an asshole he was,’ although the truth was that she’d met Acker’s father only once, ‘an asshole to Grandma, an asshole to you, just an abusive controlling narcissistic asshole you only care about,’ and here his daughter’s voice was changing into his mother’s, ‘because of the money he brings in, the royalties and licensing fees and prestige that you can’t live without,’ and here his mother’s voice was changing into his father’s, ‘because you yourself have never been able to do anything . . . nothing of your own . . . nothing original . . . you’ve just sailed your way through life like a favored parasite who –’

He was jolted awake. The plane was jolted. In a way that Acker’s dead father would never have written it, the plane was shaking. In a way that only the dead author of the universe would have written it – and gotten away with writing it, because who would have criticized – it bucked and trembled and shook. In what would later be called, by one of the festival organizers who was already on the ground in Midorca, ‘a tantrum of coincidence’, and, by the magazine journalist who’d been assigned to profile the festival who’d canceled at the last moment due to a virus, ‘an affront to the subtlety of Acker’s corpus’, it dipped and juddered and dove. The tray in front of Acker was loose and flapping and the oxygen mask that had dropped from above was flapping like a wing against his mouth as if begging him to swallow it and the biographer was twisted around in her seat and with heavy breaths as if she were snoring while awake, she was appealing to him, she was panicking, showing him blood on her jeans, blood on her blouse, blood on her head. She’d bashed her forehead on something – on the bulkhead just in front, which was smeared with blood. Acker had a pain in his gut, where he’d been thrown against his seatbelt buckle. He went to loosen the buckle, loosen the seatbelt, but it was fastened too tight, his weight was against it, and the pain remained. The plane was diving, convulsing and diving, and the overhead bins sprung open like laughter and backpacks and totes were falling out and books were falling from the bags and other bags from the back of the plane were sliding and tumbling down the aisle, along under the seats toward the front of the plane, as the plane rocked and tipped and kept tipping and rocking forward at a sharper angle and choking on its own speed, until to sit in it was to sit fully aslant with wet plastic cups and cans and bottles and loose ice and popcorn and mixed nuts and shoes and the books these passengers had both read and pretended to read and even written themselves rolling down to Acker’s row and collecting at his feet. The biographer gripped her bad knee and with her other leg stomped on whatever detritus rolled in her direction along the floor of the plane, which due to the ever-more-severely pitched angle was becoming almost a wall of the plane. Thick black smoke obscured their row’s window and the window across the way. Below them, or behind them, or wherever it was their feet could be said to be, a telephone rang, shook like the plane shook, rang. Acker couldn’t hear it ring but it was vibrating and lighting up amid the pile of books and the loafers and sneakers of wildly different sizes and for a moment he didn’t recognize that the phone was his. The biographer was howling – she was trying to tell Acker something in shrieks, while trying also to untangle her braid from her oxygen mask and hold Acker’s hand and Acker swatted the mask away and raised the armrest and grabbed the woman’s hand and held it tightly and felt the blood sucking warm and slick between them. This is it, he thought, this is the end – stuck with a bunch of helpless experts strapped into the seats of a flying lecture hall that, tipping to a pivot, now flips over and over and over itself and spirals down and down through the clouds and splinters apart in midair, the victim of a flock of large black birds that until their very last moment, when they were shredded by the engines, had been no symbol.

    "text": "The original idea, I admit, was mine, I take responsibility for that, and not only for that.

At a small dinner party my wife Helen and I hosted back in November, it seems like a long time ago now, several friends, new friends, not people we know very well, were complaining about how much time they spent on their phones, they were lamenting with early-middle-aged fatalism that their phones had long since been getting in the way of their reading real books, of their conversations with their children, of their exercise routines and their work, I remember that what struck me at the time was that anyone at all was still willing to complain out loud, even fatalistically, about a battle between us and our phones that everyone else already agreed had been so completely lost that the defeat was no longer even mentioned anymore, and it was then that I had and voiced my ill-considered and ultimately disastrous idea.

‘We should have a phoneless party,’ I said to the couple consisting of new friends as well as the couple – the Charlies we call them, a man named Charlie and a woman named Charlie – who counted as older friends, I looked at my wife (we are still married) and said: ‘Why don’t we have a phoneless party, a phone-free party? We could have it on New Year’s Day? A day free of phones?’

I suggested that on January 1st people could come over in the morning, for brunch, and then stay all day, hanging out and listening to records in our living room, and/or hiking or (if there was snow) sledding in the park, before returning to the living room and the fire, and in deference to our new friends’ enthusiasms – one of them, the woman, Sandra, was and I suppose still is a psychedelic entrepreneur specializing in little color-coded pills delivering different quantities of psilocybin powder representing everything from the most modest microdose up to a full-blown mind-rearranging trip – I also suggested that the guest room upstairs could function as a chill-out room, if that was still the term, for people who were tripping and didn’t feel like engaging with the whole living-room social experience, and if there were MDMA-takers among our guests at the phoneless party these too could be accommodated, in their own room if they liked, for example in my and Helen’s bedroom, and anyway the whole scene and event could function as a be-in (a term I knew hadn’t been current for fifty years or more, and used facetiously) of undistracted company and recreation facilitated by, among other things, the absence of our phones that were otherwise (not that I said this part, that would have been unnecessary) all the time breaking up our attention into scattered meaningless fragments of amusement and dread.

‘It’s like they do this at plays and concerts these days, sometimes,’ said Sandra – such a wholesomely pretty white woman, with broad, vaguely rural features, and immaculate peaches-and-cream skin, that she might have been the model for a fascist propaganda artist of some kind – who’d already warmed to the idea. ‘They make you hand over your phone.’

‘Exactly,’ I said. ‘We have this old wooden trunk in our bedroom. I could lock the phones in there.’

Helen too seemed to like the idea, possibly because of the prospect of our taking a bunch of drugs with friends as if we were still young, not so long ago I’d joked to her, when she’d been pressing me to take edibles before a movie, that youth was about telling yourself you really needed to stop doing so many drugs, while middle age, as it turned out, was about telling yourself you really needed to start taking more drugs, I should mention that Helen and I don’t have any children, only a cat named Harriet, so for us there really was no excuse not to spend more of our weekends becoming wiser, happier, more sexual beings by way of appropriate doses of mushrooms, MDMA, weed, et cetera, and in truth it was usually me who dragged his feet before this prospect, I suppose I was afraid that weed or mushrooms would only sharpen my attention to the horrors of the world, both the discreet grinding horror of collapse and the more spectacular horrors of state-led or freelance massacres, not to mention ‘natural’ disasters, and on account of these hovering intimations I feared I might not have such a good trip on mushrooms or edibles at all, meanwhile as for MDMA I knew that rolling (was this the term anymore?) on molly (was that the term either?) couldn’t do much for me so long as I continued, like approximately half the people I knew, to take my daily SSRI.

‘If we’re going to do this,’ Helen said brightly, ‘we should send out an invitation soon. That way people can arrange babysitters.’

Helen I won’t physically describe, she is a beautiful woman with little beside kindness in her eyes, but I find that once you are married (in my sole experience of the phenomenon so far, many of my friends, having been married at least twice by now, would be better qualified to say) you don’t really see the person anymore after a while, instead you merely recognize them, they become so familiar in their features as almost to forfeit their features completely, a little bit as if they were your own feet or something, which you never pause to study or even to see before pulling on your wool socks.

‘Oh yeah – great idea – we can hire a dog-sitter,’ male Charlie was adding to the conversation, being, with female Charlie, the owner of a large, beautiful and needy Great Dane by the name of August, a name I’m sure I’ll remember for the rest of my life.

The dinner party in question took place on Friday November 18th, I know this because I can still see in my Gmail that it was on Tuesday November 22nd that I sent out the invitation, to more than twenty friends, to a phone-free New Year’s Day party that was to get underway with brunch and last until people felt like going home, hopefully after dark, not that the arrival of dark (as the email didn’t need to say) indicated such a long day when the days are so short not even two weeks past the solstice, and our house lies so close up against the foothills to the west of town, that the sun will have set, on early-winter days, before 3.30 in the afternoon.

 

The big-box liquor store out on Kiowa opens at 8 a.m. 365 days a year, so the sign posted on the sliding front door tells you, and already at 8.30 a.m. or so on New Year’s Day, when I went out, on behalf of our guests, to buy some gin and mezcal, for brunch-time Bloody Marys and Bloody Marias respectively, it was apparent that this was an exceptionally windy day, in fact when I was driving back down Arapahoe with a passenger seat full of booze I discovered that the traffic lights had been knocked out by the wind, so that cautious drivers nosing out into the intersection had to take their turn, before accelerating, as if invisible stop signs stood at the corners of the streets rather than the dead sentries actually posted there.

Another way that I try to beat back any depression is with regular exercise, and so, after depositing the liquor back at home, I drove out to the open space south of town to get in a short run, was the idea, before our guests arrived, I was thinking that a jog through the fields near the creek, where trees were sparse, would be safer than running through the woods where a branch torn off a ponderosa by the crazy wind might well club me to the ground or worse.

Having earlier had to close my eyes against flying grit in the liquor store parking lot, when I got to the trailhead, before getting out of my car (an EV for what it’s worth), I put on the wraparound sunglasses that ordinarily I only wear while biking, in order to shield my eyes, as I ran, from the scouring dust in the air, but even so, once I was ‘running’, or really stumbling, over the trail toward the mountains, shoved by the buffeting winds at my back, I didn’t even make it a quarter of a mile before turning around and heading back to the car, out in the fields south of town there was no one else to see at 9.30 a.m. on a New Year’s Day characterized so far by merciless winds of (as I later learned) 80–100 miles an hour, except for a young woman, no doubt a professional dog walker, walking four dogs on separate leashes through the pummeling air, and I was concerned enough for the young woman’s unprotected eyes – she herself had no sunglasses on – that I offered her my wraparound sunglasses only to have her look at the author of this gesture as if he weren’t at all the good man I was meaning to be but only a strange one, anyway not only did the dog walker refuse the gift of the wraparound shades but of course there was nothing I could do for the dogs and their eyes, and I’ve often wondered since that day, with a curious persistence, whether the eyes of any of the four dogs might have been injured by what I guess I’ve already called the scouring dust in the air, when I wonder this I always think also of the crazed ticking sound of the dry grasses rummaged or ransacked by the wind, these grasses making a sound, it seemed to me at the time, of so many wristwatches (not that wristwatches are worn anymore) having gone insane all at once.

Back at home I asked Helen whether I should maybe text our friends and advise them to venture out only with ski goggles or wraparound sunglasses, if they were still coming over for our phoneless party, that is, but sensibly she insisted: ‘These are grown-ups, they can take care of themselves,’ and indeed none of our guests arrived at our house complaining of any injured eyes, it was only a few days later that we learned that Sophie and Tim hadn’t made the party because Sophie’s right eye had been hit by a particle of glass flung through the air and she and Tim had therefore spent the day at one of the urgent-care outfits in the strip malls east of downtown.

For brunch we’d laid out in the kitchen an array of bagels and bagel trimmings as well as vegan and merely vegetarian spreads, we’d also set up a station for Bloody Marys and Marias, even though a number of people wouldn’t be eating anything, or drinking beverages other than water, the better to absorb the psilocybin and/or MDMA they planned on taking.

‘Are you going to take some molly?’ Helen asked me hopefully before the first guests had arrived, and I reminded her that MDMA was unlikely to have any effect on me, given my course of antidepressants.

‘Oh right,’ she said. ‘You could take mushrooms?’

Rather than reiterate my fear of having a bad trip if I were to take drugs at any time during the remainder of the twenty-first century, I just said that it seemed to me there ought to be at least one totally sober person at the party, in case of any eventualities.

‘What eventualities?’ Helen wanted to know.

‘I mean,’ I said, ‘if we knew what they were . . .’

‘We might as well have had kids,’ she said, not unpleasantly, ‘if you were going to be this square.’

‘No one says square,’ I said.

‘I’m going to take some drugs,’ she went on, adding that she might take both some psilocybin and some MDMA.

‘I think the kids used to call that candyflipping.’

Sarcastically she said: ‘Like at Burning Man in 2003?’

For the shortest segment of a moment I wondered why someone should speak of the futuristic year of 2003 as if it were decades ago.

‘I think I’ll also keep my phone on me,’ I said. ‘Just in case.’

‘But it’s a phoneless party,’ Helen protested.

 

By noon or maybe 12.30 p.m. we’d welcomed into our house all thirteen of our guests through the back-patio door or else the front door, while I held whichever door it was against the wind, probably every one of the guests remarking as they took off their coats and boots about the absolutely crazy, totally insane wind, a few of them joking that the new year was off to an ominous start, before obediently handing over their phones which I then set down inside the mahogany trunk in our bedroom, more than a dozen years earlier I’d found the trunk in an antiques market in Buenos Aires and liked it so much that I’d had it shipped back to me in the States, the only real souvenir of a trip that otherwise I now hardly remembered, except to know I’d taken it with my girlfriend at the time, she was someone I was these days hardly ever in touch with unless one of us had to let the other know that some person or animal we had in common had died, once upon a time we’d gone to Iguazú Falls in the north of Argentina and watched a river as broad as an interstate collapse below us into a cataract of steam, small swallows somehow darting in and out of their invisible nests behind the vertical sheets of deafening water.

It can’t have been 2.30 p.m. yet before the party had sorted itself out into sober-enough people listening to LPs in the living room, and MDMA-takers in our bedroom, and elsewhere – outside in the yard, or upstairs in the guest room – people tripping hard enough on shrooms and/or molly as to want a little privacy, meanwhile I saw Helen go off, I didn’t know where, with Rachel and Dan, admittedly a very attractive couple, looking a little wistful and even perhaps guilty as she went, not that we hadn’t already discussed and both signed off on the possibility of (what to call it?) some extramarital activity one of these days if the spirit moved us, a possibility that didn’t seem very probable to either of us but that we’d allowed for anyway, now that Helen was leaving my sight it seemed to me a more melancholy fact that nothing was likely to happen for her than it would have been had a threesome actually promised or threatened to take place.

In the living room, after making sure our guests all had the drinks and/or drugs they required, I put on a Sun Ra record which had seemed adequately psychedelic for the occasion but that, once it was spinning, sounded dirge-like to me with its disorderly trudging horns, so that before the first track had even concluded I turned the stereo over to my discreetly hulking friend Alex, a college friend who’d played tight end for two years, Alex had brought over a Boards of Canada vinyl reissue for the occasion, in fact it was a record that (in CD format) I’d listened to a lot back when the techno or IDM of the first George W. Bush administration had sounded to my ears like the front edge of now.

Against the seething aural wallpaper of the – to my ears – vaguely dysphoric and minatory clicks and bleeps and swells of what I believed to be Boards of Canada’s second album, male Charlie was soon telling a humorous story about a French friend of his and female Charlie’s, a medical anthropologist, who’d recently visited them here in this college town at the edge of the Rockies and, in spite of his – the anthropologist’s – travels throughout much of Europe, Asia and the Middle East (three regions of the globe I myself generally did my best not to think about, let alone visit), found himself freaked out by and almost frightened at the – to his French mind – very large and aggressive squirrels of central North America.

I was going to ask whether the French medical anthropologist hadn’t even ever been to New York City or someplace like that, on some previous trip to North America, because didn’t they have the same kind of squirrels there, of more or less the same very frightening dimensions? but, no need, this very same question was presently posed by a guy named Rob or Doug who’d accompanied Sandra and her husband to the party, I never heard from or about this generic male personage again, it was a bit like having a joke about some current event occur to you and placing it into the search bar of Twitter or X, or whatever the doomscrolling microblogging platform was called these days, only to confirm that dozens if not hundreds of other people had already hit on the very same joke as you and there was thus no need for you yourself to make it.

‘Yeah, I know, he’s definitely been to New York,’ said male Charlie about the squirrel-menaced Frenchman. ‘I guess the squirrels weren’t the main thing he noticed there.’

Male Charlie, a tall and very handsome (I guess we have a lot of good-looking friends) half-Asian environmental consultant with a man bun, made this unobjectionably ordinary remark in the same tone of affable, accommodating decency that tends to characterize everything he says, and it occurred to me that I’d always had some difficulty talking to this Charlie for the simple reason that, not least because he was and no doubt still is in such good physical as well as mental shape, nothing at all seemed to be wrong with him, I’m not sure that I was even always very good at meeting his eyes.

Talk of the antic and threatening squirrels of North America, to which all of us were nevertheless totally accustomed, led in a moment to discussion of a more problematic local rodent, the prairie dog, whose colonies were often being flooded by county officials with poison gas so that the Hamas-like network of their tunnels beneath the fields couldn’t be enlarged in such a way as to ruin the prospect of successful irrigation for local ranchers enjoying grazing rights on such publicly owned land.

‘I guess they’re doing what they have to do,’ said Sandra’s husband Christopher. ‘But you can’t help feeling bad for them.’

‘Who, like, the prairie dogs? Or the poisoners?’ Sandra asked.

‘I mean I guess both,’ Christopher said. ‘Definitely both.’

Personally, I had attended a town-board meeting to speak up and object to the gassing of the prairie-dog colonies, suggesting that it was on the contrary ranchers and their cows who would do better to leave the land, after all the contribution of prairie dogs to climate change is surely negligible, something that can by no means be said of methane-emitting cattle, not to mention that death from poison gas must be unpleasant for mammals of all kinds, not just so-called human beings, but, on the occasion of the phone-free party, I kept this opinion to myself, not wanting to disrupt the conviviality of our friends, and instead simply ventured that capybaras, the large and tolerant buck-toothed creatures from South America, were a rodent that everyone liked and could get behind.

‘I know,’ Sandra said. ‘Our daughter saw one – we try to keep her away from screens but someone showed her a picture of a capybara . . .’

‘Search terms,’ Doug/Rob – or maybe it was Tom? – weirdly muttered.

‘. . . and from, like, that day,’ Sandra went on, ‘all she could think of was that she wants a stuffed capybara.’

‘A plush toy,’ Christopher clarified. ‘No taxidermy.’

‘And it turns out,’ Sandra said, ‘they just don’t make them! No capybara plush toys! You can’t even order one from Ecuador or wherever. Not even Peru!’

Things seemed to be going pretty well, I thought, here you had a cheerful, facetious, and occasionally informative discussion of a variety of rodents that would no doubt soon turn into a similarly cheerful, facetious, and occasionally informative discussion of some unrelated topic or other, and then another topic, until the sun started going down, and beyond, with everyone having a pretty good time at our New Year’s Day party, when it occurred to me that I genuinely – and without even having had a drink, let alone taken any drugs – didn’t know what year it was, neither what year had just ended last night nor what year it had already started being today, I mean I knew of course that it had to be two thousand and twenty-something, with the last two digits in the lower or middle twenties, but I didn’t know what the precise number was, or if we were in the midst of the first or second term of President Biden or Trump, and therefore I thought: Something is happening to me, something not good, to my brain, and at the same time had the chance to wonder, with a neutrality barely even laced with melancholy, whether my wife Helen might be right now enjoying herself in a sexual or at least physical, perhaps cuddle-puddle (to use the archaic term) sort of way, as obviously she had every right to do, especially when her husband was mildly afflicted from day to day with an increasingly immedicable depression.

 

Something I try to do on the last weekend of each month is to sweep the pine needles off the flat roof over our living room, otherwise the gutters and drains get clogged, and so on New Year’s Day my green fiberglass ladder was still leaning up against the house and visible outside the living-room window, and, without knowing exactly why I needed to get away from the eight or nine chattering friends hanging out in our living room and listening to Boards of Canada, now the B-side of the record, I excused myself to go outside and climb up the ladder to the flat roof above the living room, and, once I was up there, sober as a church mouse while everyone else was either tripping or rolling or buzzed on a Bloody Mary or Maria, I grabbed the nylon rope attached with a carabiner to the chimney over the living room and heaved myself up onto the smaller roof over the older portion of the house, with its steep eaves and tar shingles, and it was then that I saw the enormous and gathering cloud of smoke pouring toward us from the east, over the suburban tracts of ranch houses and bungalows and other low-slung dwellings, despite the speed of the wind the huge cloud was unfurling toward us with an almost stately motion, the sound of sirens in the air seemed meanwhile to confirm the reality of this terrible sight, although upon hearing the sirens I felt sure that I’d already been hearing their distributed wailing sounds for some time.

Instinctively I took out my phone and, after magnifying the picture to three times its ordinary size, started filming the advancing cloud of smoke until it occurred to me, as I looked through my phone at this oncoming spectacle, that I’d signed up for Cheyenne County’s free disaster notification service and, in fact, once I’d momentarily lowered the phone and taken it off airplane mode, there it was, a text message from the county government ordering my and Helen’s neighborhood to be evacuated due to a rapidly growing wildfire, of course upon seeing the message I googled the word wildfire and the name of our city, and saw that the local paper, recently purchased by a private equity firm, still employed at least enough journalists as to be reporting on the large blaze, driven by the exceedingly high and unseasonable winds of the day, that had begun in the plains to the east and already consumed an unknown number of structures on the edge of town.

Nothing could have been clearer at the moment than that it was my immediate responsibility, as a sober person with a phone, to clamber back down the ladder and let everyone know, in the living room or anywhere else they might be, that an evacuation order had been issued for our neighborhood and perhaps also for theirs, unfortunately we all had to clear out of the house and people should return right away to their own homes if need be to fetch their animals and/or children and/or elderly parents, I, being sober, could drive anyone who wasn’t able to drive him- or herself, things were going to be okay but we had to leave now, the trouble, however, up there on the roof, with the sun already going down at three in the afternoon, was that some strange mood of calmness, accompanied by what was almost a feeling of satisfaction, almost some species of fulfillment, came over me as I stood there, and for more than two and a half long minutes (I still have the video on my phone) I simply stood still and recorded the boiling wall of advancing smoke inside of which, before too long, flames were visible as well, I seem while I stood there to have experienced the sensation that my small life was no longer a sidelined phenomenon while some planetary juggernaut rolled on, some part of me, that is, seems to have been glad and even gratified to be directly in the line of approaching danger, and anyway I couldn’t just yet rappel down the roof holding the nylon rope, I couldn’t yet go and climb down the ladder, instead I just stayed on the roof and filmed the approaching smoke and flames with my phone until I heard a voice from our yard (it was Charlie’s, male Charlie’s) calling my name and demanding to know dude where are you?

Once I was back in the living room everyone was naturally demanding to know what was up with all the sirens and wanting me urgently to give them back their phones, everyone soon seemed to be gathered around me in the bedroom, waiting for me to unlock the trunk, as I explained to them that I’d received an evacuation order for the neighborhood.

‘Wait what caused the fire man?’ male Charlie wanted to know.

Someone said: ‘Fucking powerlines . . .’ and plausibly enough cursed the local utility.

‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘Maybe dry grass. It’s been very dry,’ as a regular visitor to the US Drought Monitor website, I knew that our region had been deeply in drought for months.

The nightmare of any cautious man must be to have been somehow totally reckless behind his own back, and it emerged, as everyone hovered around me and my locked wooden trunk, demanding their phones back so they could reach their children or elderly parents or neighbors, or simply so they could access the breaking news, that I couldn’t find the little brass key to the lock on the trunk, I truly couldn’t seem to find the key to the thing at all.

‘I can’t find the key,’ I said, I was glad that Helen wasn’t present to witness this incomprehensible failure.

‘What the fuck dude?’ tall looming Charlie the man was asking me.

I felt that I knew I’d put the key in the breast pocket of my stupid puffer jacket, it seemed to me that I could see in my memory the gesture of my having done so, but there was no key to be found either in that pocket or in any other pocket I had on my person, nor when I rushed to the kitchen could I find the vanished key on the corner of the counter where I also had a – contradictory – picture of my having left it, very strangely in the months since the fire I’ve also been haunted by a confabulated image of the fugitive brass key falling off of me, out of a breast pocket on some shirt I don’t own, as I climb head first down the ladder from the roof, something I know I never did or even, physically, could possibly do.

‘I have an axe,’ I said to the group and ran off to the carport, the truth was I’d bought an axe some time ago to split firewood before realizing that this task was more difficult and dangerous than I’d anticipated and then learning I could instead buy firewood already split into the correct size for our efficient little wood-burning stove, anyway upon my return to the bedroom I started hacking away at the trunk.

‘Let me take that,’ large well-built Alex said, he grabbed the scarcely used axe from my hands, and with three or four slow, practiced blows he split open the dark wood of the trunk, everyone was soon grabbing their phone from the ruined thing like so many starving people straining after thrown rations in a video clip.

 

In the upstairs bedroom I found Helen alone and weeping with all her clothes on, she seemed strangely unsurprised to see me arrive with Harriet the cat in her carrier and one go-bag on my back, the other, Helen’s, in my hands.

‘The roads are jammed,’ I said. ‘The streets . . .’ I was referring to the frozen traffic. ‘We have to go on foot.’

She nodded as if to confirm this was only something she already knew, and in a minute she had on her ski jacket and warmest wool hat as we walked very quickly, with some of our friends and many of our neighbors, some of whom we’d never seen before, or maybe these were only visitors, down the sidewalks sloping toward the creek, past countless stalled honking cars as we went.

‘I’m on drugs,’ Helen said, it sounded pitifully factual.

‘I know,’ I said.

‘I don’t have my gloves,’ she said.

‘Here take mine.’

‘But then you don’t have yours.’

Harriet the cat was meanwhile crying continuously inside her carrier.

‘She’s so afraid,’ Helen said, like a child.

 

My culpability in the disaster was established by the recording I’d made on the roof.

Downstairs in the bedroom, before the other phones were recovered from the trunk, I’d handed over my phone to female Charlie, telling her the passcode, and I guess the camera app was still open and so she saw the video I’d taken up there and sent it to herself (of course I had her as a contact in my phone – and still do), by the next day if not before she had already forwarded the telltale video to most of her fellow partygoers, not to mention other concerned and outraged people.

Nobody we or our friends knew were among the three people who died in the fire, but the Charlies’ house was one of the hundred and then some that were destroyed by what’s since been called the second most destructive wildfire in state history, and another thing I have to admit, there is no way around it, is that the Charlies’ dog, the Great Dane, was inside their house when it burned, one can only hope that August died of smoke inhalation before the flames could reach him.

The question of course is whether the three minutes I spent on the roof, plus the maybe four it took to break apart the trunk with an axe and recover everyone’s phone, would have been enough to allow the Charlies to make it home before all the streets were choked and save their dog, or whether they could at least have called a neighbor in time to ask him or her to rescue August, whether that would have made a decisive difference, and in this context naturally it would have been gauche and insensitive of me to insist to the Charlies: But didn’t you tell us you’d hire a dog-sitter? and when I reminded Helen of this overlooked piece of our late-November dinner-party conversation, saying ‘But didn’t they tell us they’d hire a dog-sitter?’ she simply looked at me and blinked.

About two weeks after the fire, female Charlie emailed me and said she doubted the extra minutes would have really mattered in the end and that I shouldn’t feel bad, in fact she was the person who ought to feel bad, she went on, for sending around my video from the roof to so many of our friends and blaming me for the wasted interval, in reply I wrote back saying of course I understood her passing around the video, everyone is curious about a disaster, I added that Helen and I hoped to see her and the other Charlie soon and I told her that in spite of her graciousness I would always regret the moments I’d squandered during which she and her husband might have called a neighbor, I said too that I couldn’t imagine what it was like to have lost a home as well as a beloved animal and that both Charlies should come stay in our guest bedroom for as long as they liked if this might be convenient for them, of course it doesn’t surprise or affront me that I never heard back from either Charlie or from most of the friends who attended our New Year’s Day party, it doesn’t surprise me either that Helen has hardly touched me since we returned to our intact house late at night on the day of the fire, nothing can justify my extra minutes on the roof, nor do I know what happened to the key, instead I feel myself to have descended head first down the ladder and watched in slow motion as the brass key to the wooden trunk containing all the phones tumbled out of my pocket, even though I know as certainly as any scientist believes in his findings that this can’t have been the case.

‘You don’t have any idea what happened to the key?’ I asked Helen the other day.

‘How dare you,’ she said.

I also have another image, of my responding for some reason to the initial sight of an advancing war zone-sized cloud of smoke by throwing the key off the roof into our back garden, with its wintry deadheaded flowers and accidental mulch of pine needles and ragged patches of stale snow, but this too I know to be false, even though I’ve spent hours by now looking in just the spot where, according to this image, the key must have fallen."

    "text": "John and I met at the opening of a group show in Whitechapel. He was both an artist and a curator. He had recently been interviewed by a high-profile critic for the Financial Times and was becoming a recognised figure in the art scene. He’d been organising packed events since his first year at university, pulling together work by a number of fêted young artists in exhibitions staged in post-industrial spaces, in anti-squat buildings and shuttered, dilapidated shopping centres.

I wasn’t aware of any of this at our moment of meeting, which took place in front of a portrait of John. The artist – like several of the others in the show – was a school friend of his. The painting, in which John occupied a dark, high-back armchair, had the swollen dimensions of Parmigianino’s Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror. The style reminded me a little of the American painter Alice Neel, but I didn’t say that. Instead, I said that his – John’s – thumb, indecently plain and out of proportion in the painting’s foreground, resembled a flaccid penis. John smiled then, asked who I was with.

I looked him up on the internet when I got home, coming across the piece in the FT first. Heading the short text was a landscape photograph of John’s face and shoulders, which were partly in shadow, his coarse hair flat against his scalp, the bow in his narrow lips cast into dramatic relief by the lighting. I found a longer profile of him in an exclusively online journal. Poorly written, it spoke of the way in which John’s work brought together ‘architectural concerns and virtual reality as a means of merging the real and the imagined’. ‘The relative emphasis assigned to the relationships between each of these elements,’ it continued, ‘depends on the viewer as well as on his or her presence.’ I couldn’t parse it. The other significant artefact was a quick-fire question and answer session on YouTube. Throughout the video, filmed outside Stockholm’s Moderna Museet, John, dressed in a button-down and chinos, was pulling, between responses, on a slim roll-up. A woman – French or Spanish or Italian, I couldn’t tell – was conducting the interview, laughing forcefully at most of his answers, apart from those whose tone requested a different sort of reaction. ‘Wow,’ she said at such moments, the way you might to a child showing you a new toy. He would furrow his brow then, glance down, ash his cigarette. I watched the video a few times, wondering what he was thinking.

I was relieved whenever I reached the end of the clip and found that it had done nothing to shatter my image of John, now part constructed in retrospect.

 

Our first date was at the Coach & Horses in Soho. John listened closely as I spoke about the writing I was working on, and, without taking his eyes off the table in front of him, said that it made him think of Susan Sontag’s Death Kit – ‘Her second novel, I think.’

I told him I wasn’t overly familiar with her work, that I’d only read one or two of the essays for my undergraduate seminars. I had recently realised, after years of pretending to have read or seen things I had not, that being as specific as possible about any gaps in one’s knowledge had the counter-effect of making you appear sufficiently informed. It was a trick I had noticed men deploying not only in private conversations, such as the one I was having with John, but in their writing as well – and not only in relation to their cultural consumption. The cleverest ones were attuned to, were endlessly articulate on, the subject of their own interpersonal shortcomings. I did not yet know that John’s tactic – the hasty provision of references, of names and titles in lieu of personal, subjective responses – was yet another method of obfuscation.

The synopses of Sontag’s novels and short stories I later uncovered online made them sound dire. As uncertain as I was of my judgements back then, it appeared clear to me that they employed experimental narrative techniques as a means of plastering over Sontag’s lack of feeling for fiction – revolving, as they did, around so-called unreliable narrators and otherwise flat characters defensively styled as archetypes.

So, John had been correct; in this respect alone, Sontag’s fiction sounded a lot like mine – or what it might have become, if I’d pursued it then. The comparison with Sontag is interesting also in that it now furnishes me with some key information regarding John’s first impression of me: superficially over-serious but fundamentally childlike. An open wound, in other words.

 

What was my fantasy of John? Meeting him, pursuing our relationship – it all seemed preordained. I loved John and, most of the time, early on, felt that he loved me too. But the beginning of our relationship also felt like a negotiation, like a setting-out of terms, which, being young and in awe, I had eagerly agreed to. I did not yet know that their flouting was something that I could – and would – be pulled up on.

‘I never want to be one of those couples,’ he had said, ‘arguing on the corner.’ Meaning: Never dispute me in public.

‘I need my space, a lot of alone time.’ My needs will supersede yours.

I met his friends. I met Jude, his older sister. We went to dinner, to events: gallery openings, screenings, book launches. The adult life I had envisioned began to take shape, all at once. Being recognised as part of a couple thrilled me; I felt legitimised. John had a life, a full life. He had immediate and extended family, people he had known since childhood, school, university. I was surprised to discover that he found it all quite stifling. My own upbringing had been rootless, what with our various moves and my mother’s long and definitive estrangement from her relatives. I suppose you could say that I was unencumbered – I think that might have been John’s word.

 

One friend of John’s had dubbed me ‘icy’. John told me so with relish, pronouncing the word in a way that made it sound more ‘enigmatic’ than ‘frigid’, more of a positive than a negative. He sounded impressed, and I understood something then about the kind of partner John wanted to be seen with: someone cutting, that was, someone a bit unusual. And yet, someone malleable. Someone whose eccentricities would generate interest that would ultimately divert back to him. (‘Where is she from?’ ‘Where did he find her?’ ‘Young, isn’t she?’) I began to believe that this was what I wanted too.

I had been consumed by other men before, but never in combination with an equity of interest. While we were dating, John would never drop out of contact as those other men had, would never return to my inbox to creepingly ask whether our arrangement could be made, or might remain, ‘casual’, ‘low-key’.

He had just been through a break-up when we first met. We ran into his ex early one morning near his flat in Brixton as he delivered me to the Tube. Isobel was John’s age – older than me by almost ten years – and well put together. I eyed her coat and haircut as she and John exchanged a few words. On his failing to make introductions, she shot a curt hello at me, which felt less like a greeting and more like a swipe at John, before flicking her eyes back to him and arranging her face into an expression that I now know to have been incredulity.

‘I knew that would happen,’ John had said, wincing, as we’d moved off.

I looked Isobel up on Facebook and spent too long assessing what I could about her and John’s relationship by tracing the nature and frequency of their public interactions.

John and I had already started to argue by this point, though always in private, our whispered, tearful reunions only consolidating our bond.

‘I’ve never met anyone like you,’ he said once, after a particularly wrenching falling-out.

Two months later, we were married.

 

The wedding took place in London. Not long after, we moved to Cork; later, to Edinburgh. The moves to Ireland and Scotland were made to follow John’s work. I’d recently begun a PhD based in England, in Sussex, but I could be more or less anywhere for the duration. The only thing I would miss out on was the teaching experience typically offered to doctoral students entering their second year of research.

John had studied at Central Saint Martins and the Slade. There, he’d worked on large-scale installations, which had evolved into virtual-reality experiences, subtle engagements with new technologies that soon gave way to more sensational outputs. In one of these, a piece titled Hold Your Applause, viewers were invited to watch from all angles as structural fires erupted at some of the world’s best-loved monuments and museums, and they burned to the ground in real time – the Sagrada Família, the Anne Frank House, the Met, Notre-Dame . . . Applause was described in commentaries as an act of desecration akin to Ai Weiwei’s Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn, an artwork said to be geared towards challenging the audience’s cultural values. Following criticism from political leaders, however, as well as an incident in which a gallery visitor stamped on one of the VR headsets, destroying it, the piece was retired.

After we were married, John put his own art practice on hold to focus on curating. With his connections to other young artists and his specialism in VR, he’d hit a rich seam in the eyes of the gallery directors. He wanted to reclaim the gallery space, he said in interviews, to progressively ‘withdraw’ it from the ‘clutches of good taste and self-censorship, political correctness and virtue-signalling’. But having initially enjoyed the notoriety his public image had elicited – furthered by articles with titles such as ‘John Munro: Is Edgelord an Insult?’ and ‘John Munro Does Not Like People’ – he was soon keen to shake off the iconoclasm that had earned him the attention of the major gallerists. In truth, he’d been spooked by the controversy his work had generated. I knew it, though he’d never put it into so many words. Applause had been borne of a love for architecture, he’d insist in interviews, the piece’s title wholly ironic. He’d worked through endless technical drawings to produce it, to calculate exactly when Gaudí’s towers would drop, at what point Lassus’s rose windows might burst. Eventually, the line took, and things quietened down, the write-ups now stating that, although no less impish, John’s outlook should not be dismissed as mere trolling. This was evident in his present interests, which were ‘much closer to home’; he was studying the Classical Revival, and the influence of the British eighteenth-century architects James Gibbs and Robert Adam on contemporary life. ‘Such an incredible draughtsman,’ he would repeat, whenever he showed me images of Adam’s work. I liked the images, though they didn’t move me as they did John. We both enjoyed the work of Alexander ‘Greek’ Thompson, however, a pioneer of sustainable architecture in Glasgow. John had grown up in Scotland and had always wanted to ‘get back up there’. When he was offered a job at a gallery in Edinburgh, he was happier than I’d ever seen him, and I felt hopeful.

I felt hopeful for myself too: I had just published my first academic article and soon after received an invitation to speak to students at Oxford. The soliciting lecturer had made much of placing me in New College’s old quarters as opposed to a hotel. It had been blazing hot throughout my stay. I’d felt out of place in the college gardens, among the younger students, and so I’d walked further into town, towards the shops and the Ashmolean Museum.

Inside, the lofty, air-conditioned space had been a respite from the day’s sun. I’d found the Italian Renaissance gallery and stationed myself in front of an early landscape, enjoying the feel of the smooth wooden bench on the backs of my legs. After a while, I’d drifted down to the gift shop, lingering by a display wall of postcards, listening in to the conversations taking place around me. Shortly, I was approached by a man. He was younger than John, nearer my own age. He had noticed me upstairs, he said. Could he ask me about the painting I’d been looking at? Unsure of how to put him off, I allowed him to buy me a coffee and to talk for a while before excusing myself. ‘I’ve got to meet my parents,’ I told him, smiling, moving to leave, my limbs suddenly weak and heavy. ‘It was nice speaking to you.’

Late the following day, after my talk, I took a coach and then a small plane back to Cork. I remember watching the toy-like propellers starting up through the window, the stewards turning the lights down for take-off, and then the feeling of hurtling through the dark, of being delivered back.

 

Life in Cork lasted three years. Once we were installed, John alternated between phases of self-isolation and something more obdurate, an anger that became the weather in which I lived. We rented a terraced house in Montenotte, a district sensationally named after a Napoleonic battle that took place in the Apennine Mountains. Located on a hill overlooking the River Lee, the area to the north of the city was sharply elevated and populated by lush trees. It had the feeling of being its own village, with its pub, post office and coffee shop, with its lone bus stop from which a trail of residents – all waiting to be ferried into town – would slowly build and diminish at intervals.

John returned to England every two months or so, sojourns in which he would attend openings and hold meetings with artists. These departures were marked by a sudden upswing in mood that was at once relieving and disconcerting. After he had packed, John would seem both impatient to leave and strangely tender, his attitude towards me softened. ‘I’ll miss you,’ he would say, as he waited in the hallway for a taxi to the airport. ‘I love you.’ ‘Me too,’ I would reply. ‘Me too.’ I rarely heard from him while he was away.

Aside from my research, there was little for me to do, and so during the daytime I would either take up in the kitchen or work on my thesis from a small desk I’d tucked into a corner of the bedroom. From there, I could see clearly the sage-green house on the corner opposite, the stuffed tiger in its ground-floor window whose presence I had chosen to take as a good omen when we’d first come to the street for a viewing.

Every now and then I would head out to the Triskel Arts Centre for a film, for a coffee on the Grand Parade. I would walk, making my way via Shandon, pausing there to look at the finer homes on Aubrey Place and the view they shared out over Bell’s Field, a stench of malt emitting from the industrial brewery across the motorway.

I endeavoured to make friends, but none stuck. I felt alien. When he wasn’t away, John stayed in most nights, drinking a bottle of red, sometimes two, by himself. Inevitably, this would lead to his rounding on me. ‘What do you think you’re doing?’ he would ask me, his face flushed, contorted, his eyes unseeing. ‘What are you doing here?’

When he was forced out for work – for a private view or some other event at the gallery – he was so affable with his colleagues and acquaintances, with the strangers we were introduced to, that I felt mad, senseless, obliged to play along. I realised then that I was the outlet (the only one), that it was through me alone that John could siphon off his resentments, his frustrations. That, in this sense, I was a vital part of his life.

 

Ibegan waking in the middle of the night, usually at around two or three o’clock. At that hour, I would move slowly downstairs and occupy the sofa that divided the open-plan living room and kitchen. I would snack on things that could be prepared quickly and quietly. I would read or watch the films I thought John would otherwise prohibit. I had lately become taken with notions of purity and its soiling, a preoccupation whose focal point was, for some weeks, Pauline Réage’s The Story of O. I came across the book in a charity shop in Cork city centre, a cracked black paperback decorated with a spare, italicised font dubbing the novel ‘The Erotic Classic’. I was immediately struck by its use of the present tense, by its swiftness and inscrutability. Within the first three sentences, O, the title character, is ushered into what looks like a Paris taxi, though René, her lover, doesn’t say a word to the driver. ‘Here we are,’ he announces, simply, after a short journey in which O has obediently removed her stockings and underwear on René’s instruction. They are outside a château. O is led inside and heavily made up by two other women (‘her mouth very red, the point and halo of her nipples rouged’), after which she submits herself to the sexual predilections of a secret society. She is flayed. She is manhandled and chained to the château’s walls for hours at a time. She is penetrated by one man after another in regular orgiastic sessions. René looks on. During one such session, an associate has difficulty entering O and demands that she have her anus stretched, which she does (after René approves the modification), in increments.

O’s story fascinated me. In her ostensible debasement was an obscure victory that filled me with competing desires. I was turned on, I was repulsed, I was fascinated, I was exasperated. I was judgemental. I was many other things besides. I couldn’t have named all of the feelings I experienced in response to these narratives. To name them would be to flatten and domesticate them. To attempt to situate them within a system to which they never belonged. What I remember most clearly, in any case, is my coming to when I would stop reading, when the room would brighten in time with the sky outside, and I would readjust to my surroundings, albeit with the feeling of having participated in a long and drawn-out purgation.

It was during these wakes that I became aware of John’s emails to a photographer he’d met at a party in London. Joanna Kolasinski. I liked her work. Most of the images on her website were self-portraits, underdeveloped film photographs in which she struck enigmatic poses, gesturing stiffly with her hands and body while her face maintained a seductive, stoic expression. Her most recent series featured the artist posing as a dressage horse in various set-ups: in a cluttered artist’s studio; on an upturned skip in a parking garage; on an MDF plinth, in a field, her long hair pulled into a tight, knotted braid; between the swings in a children’s playground.

Her tone with John was light, friendly, to begin with: this you? read the subject line of her first dispatch. Mainly, the two of them discussed art and films and music, much of which I had never heard John mention before. But Joanna soon became more sincere, her abstractions more directed. I enjoy our conversations . . . she’d added dreamily, just before signing off, at the end of her third or fourth email.

It was something John had said to me that had planted the seed, sent me looking. We’d been watching a film, which he had chosen and which he had liked, because the plot confirmed a theory of his regarding accusations as self-fulfilling prophecies. If you accuse someone of cheating, John had contended, by way of an example, they would most likely cheat. Why? Because they felt they were already paying for the crime; they might as well commit it. I checked John’s inbox every morning after that. Once the initial horror had subsided, I experienced a new affect, a merging of relief and disappointment, when there was nothing new to read. By true morning, the correspondence felt like something I’d made up.

The exchange had ended abruptly when Joanna mentioned that she might be in Ireland for some location shooting in a few months’ time. Should they try and meet for a drink, she wondered. It’s my wife’s birthday around then, John had replied, introducing – too suddenly – a newly formal register. It’s likely we’ll be away. Joanna never responded to that non sequitur, and I allowed myself to forget, for things to still.

I was sure there’d been others. I knew there had been, in fact. Another woman, back in London, before John’s first proper job and the move to Cork. I had chosen to forget her too. She was a friend of his, and had been staying with us, having briefly returned from a new life in France to collect some documents from storage and catch up with friends. Weeks before I understood what had taken place (a realisation that dawned long after her departure), she came into my office and asked whether I could help her with something. Of course I could. She’d wanted to put an old nose piercing back in. I had offered her a seat at my desk chair, and she’d handed me the small silver stud. I’d tucked her hair into the scarf she wore around her head in the mornings and found the tiny indent, trying the stud gently at first. The hole had closed over. I’d said as much.

‘Just push it,’ she’d said. ‘Don’t worry about hurting me.’

I’d done as she’d asked, and she’d looked up at me then, her eyes red and watery, her expression one of tempered exhilaration.

When I confronted John, on a sudden notion weeks later, he was stunned into silence. Finally, he conceded that she’d made a pass at him while she was staying, and that, yes, he’d given in, for a moment, having had a drink, but that he had quickly gathered himself and rebuffed her. I pressed, but I was never able to get any more out of him than that. He told me, further, in tones of reassurance, that she was ‘damaged’, a word that recurred with notable frequency in his accounts of younger women.

 

Ithink I agree with John’s speculations on infidelity as a self-fulfilling prophecy, incidentally – only, it seemed to me that John had always been the one to accuse himself. He behaved as someone pinioned from the outset. He had the posture, from the moment I met him, of a man who viewed himself as terminally hard done by. Once his worries about the judgements of his ex Isobel had worn off, I’d inherited the position of arbiter as his self-generated need for condemnation tracked over to me. There was little I could have done to dodge it, to shirk the role I’d been attributed against my will. This desire for castigation was something John experienced both in his personal relationships and in the professional realm. ‘Of course, no one wants to hear what I think,’ he would often say, all evidence to the contrary, when we were discussing a catalogue introduction he’d just finished, an interview he’d given – ‘I’ was not a pronoun here but a name, and the name was his. This was, further, a clipped phrase that signalled the end of an exchange, and as such doubled as a notice that I had said the wrong thing, something to displease him. It might be more generous to say that I’d inadvertently grazed an insecurity, that John was, at the heart of it all, a deeply insecure person.

Initially, the move to Edinburgh felt like a turn in the road. We adopted a cat, Mingus, from a friend of a friend, his beauty and benign presence elevating the mood in the new flat for several weeks. We doted on him. Drawn into a tenuous camaraderie by our mutual admiration, John and I began to do other things together: to go walking along the stream near the foot of Blackford Hill; to frequent Summerhall, an old veterinary school turned arts complex.

I handed in my thesis that first winter and immediately began applying for lecturing jobs. The institutions to which I submitted myself tended to be run, at the level of middle management, by other white women in their thirties and forties. It was a fact John never failed to remark on, conflating the women for effect – ‘Bryonies or Kates or Helens . . .’ Initially, the tone of these asides implied that I was in on the joke, but this changed as I became inducted into academia, though he knew full well I didn’t share these women’s background, or what I – we – assumed was their background (middle class, Oxbridge-educated). I’m sure people made the same assumptions of me. I suppose that was the point.

When, after a second interview, I was offered the job I’d hoped for at the University of Glasgow, receiving a phone call on the train home, I rang John. He was mute. I had to beg him to meet me at the pub at the other end. My friends Jay and Aimee bought me a mini bottle of Prosecco, toasted me with their pints. John remained quiet, concave. ‘Of course – though I’m not surprised,’ were his words, when Aimee (via a semi-ironic ‘Aren’t you proud of your wife?’) finally forced a response.

 

As I reached the age John had been when we’d first met, I began to undergo an internal shift that was slow-moving and profound. This was the age at which the shape of one’s own face, as regarded from unfamiliar angles in candid photographs, is no longer disturbing, no longer a psychic rupture. This was the age of thirty, or thereabouts.

I wouldn’t have been able to identify the shift, at the time. Not in such words. Its main symptom – or perhaps its effect – was a need to reach outward, to speak to other people and to reverse the walling-in I had undergone throughout my twenties. I made friends through my new job, people my own age, including Rowan, who as well as being a junior lecturer at Glasgow was one of the trade-union organisers. They had all liked John to begin with, but he had soon started drinking again – to excess. On such occasions, he would embark on rants, talking himself into a stupor, cutting down anyone who dared contradict his line of thinking. I was embarrassed, and later, at home, scared. Heartbroken.

What I tried to convey to John, several times, was that my love for him had become diminished, in increments, over the years. That with each blow, each transgression, a withdrawal had been made. Without equitable deposits, I told him, the account would eventually be emptied. ‘Where do you get this stuff ?’ he’d spat at me. ‘Films?’ – a barrage that would finally devolve into his wondering aloud what my new ‘right-on’ friends would think of me employing metaphors of finance.

One of the final withdrawals took place during the university strikes that year. I’d been on the picket in Glasgow with Rowan, Stephen and some other colleagues and students, protesting the recent pension reforms. John met us all later, at the pub.

‘Solidarity,’ he spat, after most people had left and the barman had rung last orders. ‘The word sticks in my throat. Makes me choke.’

On another occasion, he had instructed me to be ‘careful’ around Rowan. ‘Watch yourself,’ he’d said, ‘if you’re ever alone with him. He’s a strange guy.’ And then, seeing my look of bafflement, ‘I’m serious.’

 

Our final weeks in the shared flat were unbearable.

We’d already agreed to a trial separation and handed in our one-month notice. When, however, I told John about a viewing I had for a flat in Glasgow, he wasted no time in accusing me of having progressively carved out the conditions that would enable me to leave. I wondered if this might have been true on a subconscious level, though I hadn’t actively considered doing so until months after I’d started my new job. By that time, a sense of possibility cloaked every one of my solitary experiences, as when I would walk home from Edinburgh Haymarket through the industrial West End, along the Union Canal, a route that I had come to love and would soon miss. Quitting the station’s older, pillared entryway, I would stride over busy junctions, past tall, flashing office buildings, until I reached a commercial development that let out onto wooden decking and, eventually, a quiet canal-side path. Proceeding from its terminus, the canal was lined on one side by barges and the back ends of businesses (mechanics, takeaways, a kung fu gym), and on the other by a corrugated-metal fence guarding a shabby, rubbly grassland. I took plenty of photos of the lift bridge as I crossed it at sunset while heading towards our flat on Holy Corner, a crossroads so named because of its four facing churches.

It was a route one of my new colleagues, Farah, had shown me. One evening, after work, we’d bumped into each other stepping off the train from Glasgow. As we funnelled along the platform and moved up the narrow escalator, through the ticket barriers and over the station concourse towards the exit, it became clear that we were heading in the same direction. On our way home, Farah spoke without pause. Her topic was her long-term boyfriend, whose books, she informed me, were the dominant feature of their small flat. ‘Shelves upon shelves of them,’ she said, including second-hand and rare editions. ‘Remnants of a former life.’

The week before he had come home to find that Farah had been frying fish on the hob. He had become angry and disturbed, had shouted and thrown things.

‘Doesn’t want the smoke to ruin the bindings,’ she’d said, shooting me a nervous glance. And then, smiling weakly, ‘It’s his fear of the abject.’

‘It’s a great healing space,’ said Katy, my soon-to-be landlord, as she’d first watched me look round. I’d just told her I was separating from my husband. She knew already that I worked at the university, that my office was nearby. She was herself a curator at the Centre for Contemporary Arts. We had a few people in common – other curators, gallery workers, artists, writers . . . She’d have known John, if I’d named him. Maybe I didn’t need to; she was bright, eager with me.

‘It’s lovely,’ I said, taking in the tall windows and high ceilings. The tasteful mid-century furniture and custom-built bookshelves. These features largely eclipsed the flat’s size, which was very small, more or less a single room with a galley kitchen. The windows provided an impressive view of the street: the crescent opposite and the parish church across the road. All of this underlined by bright-red flowers in terracotta window boxes.

‘I’ll be leaving those,’ said Katy quickly, as she saw me register them.

 

‘I’m not going to make this easy for you,’ John said one morning, bearing down. He meant it. While packing for the move, I would leave the house for more sealing tape and return to find my boxes slit open, their contents disturbed. I had mistakenly taken some of his things, John would inform me, happily. Most of the things were books that I was either ambivalent about or could find other copies of. I let them go. One of the items John retrieved, however, was a small ink drawing his grandmother had made years earlier of her two whippets, Sidney and Daisy, long since dead. She had gifted it to me shortly after John and I were engaged, carefully wrapped in pale tissue paper. As with most of the objects he’d inherited, it was an object towards which John had always appeared indifferent; in every house and flat we’d lived in it had hung above the vintage school desk where I did my work. ‘How can I explain this,’ he’d said when I’d protested, bringing his hands together under his chin, aiming his forehead at me. ‘This picture is part of my legacy. I realise that’s difficult for you to understand.’

 

On moving day, Katy let me in and handed me two sets of keys, beaming as though I’d won a prize. Once she’d gone, I opened the sash windows, noting again the church, its blonde sandstone gleaming in the sun, before turning to take in the room, the details I’d come to overlook.

The flat smelled strongly of cleaning product that day and for some time afterwards: synthetic mint and something floral, something sweet. The sum of my things barely filled two-thirds of Katy’s shelves. I padded out the empty nooks with postcards.

John and I could rarely agree on where we ought to live, on what ‘home’ ought to look like. My early attempts at decoration were crude, I know that now. I would buy textiles, small things that would make me happy in isolation, but which came to appear cheap and incongruous among the worn objects of John’s birthright: dark hardwood tables and chairs, loom rugs, Italian majolica, original paintings in dull gilt frames. I knew my additions were wrong and yet hate filled me up as I watched John absent-mindedly destroy these imports with staining foodstuffs and cigarette ash, with trailed-in muck. I hated myself for hating that process of mindless destruction, in turn. I hated what I had become, the instincts I had developed in response to my situation. They were displacements of a much greater need – of the need for individuation.

Not long after I’d left, I dreamt that John and I travelled the southern edges of Britain in search of somewhere to live, somewhere we could agree on. We went to various seaside towns, real and imagined, speculated on whether we could live there. We never could. In one of the towns, perhaps the second or third we visited, a group of people were openly hostile to John. A blonde woman was particularly vicious. It became clear to me that John had been involved in a road accident there many years ago: a boy, a toddler, had been killed. The blonde woman was the boy’s mother or possibly his elder sister. No arrests had been made but the town had not forgotten the tragedy. It had a deep scar running through it, and John’s return had caused that scar to beat.

Why bring me here, I wondered, and then I woke up."

At least one of our crowd had actually met Evan Greene at an earlier moment in his, Evan Greene’s, life, his political life if I may call it that, before Evan Greene succumbed to the dark beckoning of lethal excess.

When was I first aware of him? He probably introduced himself at some point. I didn’t realize he was living at Number Six at first. Clam Shell Cottage it’s called. I knew the woman who lived there before. I’d been away for a few months, and when I came back, there he was.

I wasn’t aware of him the way you mean until that first incident three years ago.

Who was living there before him?

Jackie Something. Jackie Banning. She was a club promoter, a PR person. She lived by herself.

Did she know Evan Greene?

I have no idea. Why would she?

She might have recommended him to the landlord.

I wouldn’t know. We weren’t friends. I knew her the way you know people you see all the time without thinking about them. I like having neighbors, but they’re usually horrible when you get to know them. Jackie was all right. She gave parties. I went to a couple. But I can’t remember anybody I met there. I don’t know what happened to her.

What were your impressions of Evan Greene before the incident three years ago?

If you look at Number Six from here, you only see that side of it through the trees really. I didn’t run into him every day. I mostly saw him getting in or out of his car.

Just a general impression.

I honestly never gave him a thought. Before, I mean. They say he did modeling when he was young. I could believe that. He has very waspy features. But when I try to picture his face he really looks like nothing. He got very thin. I did notice that. Almost skeletal. His skin started to resemble parchment. We didn’t speak often. Hello goodbye in the parking lot, and a few times at the pool. Or I’d run into him at the supermarket. This isn’t a close-knit community. We’re not up each other’s noses. I see most people here at the supermarket, if ever.

Can you recall any of those conversations?

He was always on about local politics. I have no interest in local politics. In one ear out the other. Dogs, also. He talked about dogs quite a lot.

He had a group that rescued golden retrievers.

Why would you only rescue the most expensive type of dog? He didn’t even have a dog himself.

What else did he talk about?

Nothing memorable. Talked your ear off but nothing you’d remember afterwards. Other people had more contact with him. I didn’t like him, frankly. Something about him wasn’t right. He had scary eyes. Empty, icy blue eyes. They say he used to scream at city council meetings. Even when you had an ordinary conversation with him, he had the look of someone screaming, even though he wasn’t.

Pepper Gillespie was friendly with him. In Coulibri Cottage, over the way. And Dr Balvet, Dr Balvet’s place is the one behind his. He knew him socially, I think. I’m sure Solberg in the front cottage saw things, he spies on everybody. Stargazing, he calls it.

The way it was reported made more sense than what actually happened. I never heard of this slamming thing until the article came out in The Times, but I imagine Evan Greene was as fucked up as they were. It excited him to keep it going. He wouldn’t have been rational. Addicts never know what they’re doing, in my experience.

Did you notice these young men coming and going all the time?

It wasn’t all the time. That’s been exaggerated in the press. They weren’t all young, either. The first one that died was almost sixty. None of them were children. It’s a tough thing to decipher. It’s hard to imagine getting off on that. Each to his own and everything but . . .

Anyway, sure, I noticed them. I saw things. I have a pretty clear view of Number Six between the trees. I don’t sleep much. It would’ve been hard not to notice the traffic in and out of Evan Greene’s place. But for a long time it just seemed like, an old, gay white guy with lots of young Black friends. After the first one died, Roderick Williams, I think we started to look at Evan Greene differently.

You were friends with him?

Not at all. If somebody told you that, I bet I can guess who it was.

What were your encounters with him like?

He came on to me once, a few years ago. You know he posed as a photographer for a while. I think he had some delusions of being a Robert Mapplethorpe or Nan Goldin type or what have you. He dropped the pretense after a while, apparently. The news stories never mentioned it. Anyway, once, this was by the pool, he said he wanted to photograph me for an art show. He found my tattoos fascinating, he said.

Did he photograph you?

No, I told him I don’t like being photographed. I guess he thought, because of the tattoos . . . I was standing there in my swim shorts and his eyes kept zooming in on my crotch, not furtively at all, he made his interest obvious. It was a bit creepy. He didn’t like being turned down. He took a negative attitude toward me for a while after that. Later, when he really started to change, visibly change, he suddenly became insanely friendly and talkative.

You thought he was insane?

I thought he was taking a lot of speed, or coke, to be that intense.

Anyway, now we know, the guy’s a monster. Became one. I don’t think he was that way before the drugs. It was a real Jekyll and Hyde thing. I feel slightly sorry for him, because it sounds like he’s going to get what amounts to a life sentence at his age. They’ve piled on all these charges like ‘operating a drug house’, which is going overboard in my opinion. It doesn’t seem fair.

What do you think would be fair?

I’d rather see him sent to rehab than prison. It’s just an opinion. None of this would’ve happened if he hadn’t gotten into meth. Meth turns people into robots. The way he’s been painted, he’s likely to get murdered in jail.

He shouldn’t have preyed on those people, if you want to frame it like that, no doubt. They weren’t the brightest bulbs in the box. On the other hand, they kept going back after they knew what they were getting into, so . . . It’s hard to know what to think about it.

 

aksel solberg, 59, and rosa solberg, 56, tenants of marlin cottage

If the press uncovers anything to grab on to, any stray detail, to make an ugly story sell, they will. It was lucky nothing about the estate figured in the reporting, aside from him living in a ‘fantasyland’ or ‘storybook’ cottage. Otherwise, we’d get tour buses coming through here. It was bad enough that that boy’s family and their political friends turned up every weekend before the arrest. They seemed to think everyone on the estate was somehow implicated in the whole thing. But once Greene was in custody it all went quiet as far as where he lived and all that. Otherwise, some of the old stories about this place would come to light again, no doubt. Not just the suicides, either. The press stuck to its political morality tale and left the neighbors out of it.

This is a totally different –

I know that. I know that. But the reporting has been horrendous. You can see it’s been blown up to fit a particular narrative. Two different ones, in fact. What happened was disgusting. But things like this happen somewhere in this city every night. The race factor got played up, along with the myth about Evan Greene being a billionaire with powerful political connections. What billionaire drives a shitty car like that beat-up Prius he drove?

These cottages are rent-stabilized. You wouldn’t think so, for such prime property. Nobody on the estate has anything like a billion dollars. Evan Greene sold a small data-processing service in Scottsdale ten years ago for two point three million dollars and he’s lived off that nest egg ever since. I looked into it. Tesseray bought the whole property for less than that. It’s no billion dollars.

It’s nice here of course. Exceptional for what we’re paying. The cottages are sweet. Very comfortable, even if they do look a bit Disney. ‘Disney Whimsy’, someone said, with grace notes of perversity. On clear nights I watch the stars above the clouds, through that telescope. The night sky puts things in perspective. We’re nothing but lint on a tiny ball of dirt and water. I mean from a cosmic angle. We all get tossed around on the currents of the universe. That’s the Evan Greene story, more or less.

Were you living here the first time the police showed up?

The police have been here more often than you think. But I know which time you mean, obviously. We were. We’ve lived here almost as long as Dr Balvet or Theresa Lennox, who has the place near the side gate. She’s not one of the original tenants, but she’s been here the longest. She’s a hoarder, apparently. A real fruitcake.

There were several minor incidents leading up to the first really serious one, in the weeks before.

One night a young man wearing a pair of white underpants came running out of Evan Greene’s house up to the side gate and away into the night. He was clutching his clothes. I suppose he pulled them on when he got to the stairs. Definitely in a panic. I happened to be out here stargazing. Another time one of Greene’s charming guests sat masturbating on that bench over there at two in the morning. Rosa was awake for some reason and happened to look out. She came into my room and told me about it. I threw on a robe and chased him off. I had words with Evan Greene about that. He fed me some convoluted tale about volunteering at a mental clinic years earlier, and this guy being a former client who somehow found out his address. I didn’t believe a word of it but I just let it go.

Men sometimes showed up at the main gate or came in through the street entrance. And they often came out stumbling and looking seriously wrecked. I just assumed they were rent boys. They were rent boys, as it turned out.

Did you or, if you know, any of the other tenants call the police when –

These people coming to see Evan Greene at all hours were often familiar to me. If I saw someone going there once, chances were I’d see the same person again over the course of a week or a month. After that it would be someone else. They were generally pretty well-dressed. I wouldn’t call the police just because someone I recognized looked wasted or turned up at weird hours, unless they seemed threatening. Theresa Lennox would, I imagine. Nadia Steiger might. They’re both a little nuts, in my opinion.

They didn’t, though.

That was more out of laziness than consideration, I’m sure. The thing is, people would shout his name from the front gate, where he couldn’t possibly hear them. Someone who did hear them would have to go down and explain that after sunset, when the gate gets locked, you’re supposed to have the code, or phone whoever you’re visiting to let you in. I had to do that a few times. I let them in, just to avoid trouble.

You might have kept them out for the same reason.

Looking at it now, that’s probably true. Of course they didn’t need a code for the side gate. There’s just a flight of narrow steps that runs up from the boulevard and then an ordinary wrought-iron mesh door, if they knew where it was. It’s a bit hard to find. There’s a lot of overhanging vegetation. There’s no light there. That gate’s almost never locked. It’s overgrown with ivy.

Actually, the police came more than once about Evan Greene before all this. Something to do with drugs. But that was all handled quietly. They never arrested him.

Did the owner ever try to evict him, do you know?

What, Mr Tesseray? Not at all. Him and Evan Greene have certain interests in common, I would think. It’s probably why he rented to Greene in the first place. They were friends.

What interests?

Well, not rescuing dogs, let’s say.

 

theresa lennox, 76, tenant of starfish cottage

I’m not set up for company at the moment. We can sit out here.

I just have to send a text message.

Okay.

I look after the plantings and landscaping. Not all of it, but some. The walkways and the shrubs, the hedges, the trees, the fieldstone benches, and so forth, were laid out in the late 1940s, but a lot of it’s changed over the years. I came here in ’86, after Tesseray bought the estate from the original owner’s trustees.

Who was the original owner?

I can’t think of his name offhand. He built these cottages . . . houses really . . . shifted a lot of the hillside, flattening parts of it out. None of it’s exactly flat, but flat enough where the houses are to put up structures, with all this foliage and garden areas between them. You make the foundations level when the land’s crooked.

He thought of himself as a sea captain. I read that somewhere. There’re nautical motifs, little seafaring touches in all the cottages. McAvery. The name just came to me. People called him Captain McAvery. In reality he’d never been on a ship, I’m told. He made all his money in noodles. Spaghetti imports, farina wheat from Spain or Italy, something like that. Captain McAvery the spaghetti king.

So, Elio Tesseray hired you –

No, not until long after I moved in. It happened more recently, that Tesseray needed help with the grounds. He knew I worked with plants and gardens. It’s only an occasional job. He hires a crew for heavier work. For instance, replacing the soil. The soil here is too alkaline for sycamores, and he wanted sycamores. They’re valuable trees. The ones over there were brought in from Idaho.

The drought has affected things. We can’t use the water we normally would. The fires don’t help either. Soot from the big fires gets carried here. Soot is oily, it reduces photosynthesis. By the time it gets here it’s particulate matter you don’t really see. It does a lot of damage. Leaves develop chlorosis and turn yellow. It isn’t that severe now, because of these torrential rainstorms. Which are pretty weird in themselves. But the fires are just going to continue to come in the dry season, and get bigger. The landscape is taking its revenge. Anyway . . .

Anyway –

Yes, anyway. What can I tell you? The tenants had a meeting after Roderick Williams died. Then another meeting after Jason Crosby died. Fat lot of good it did.

You went to these meetings?

At Solberg’s place. I didn’t stay long at either one. All they wanted to do was drink Solberg’s wine from Solberg’s vineyard and talk about Evan Greene for ten minutes and then chit-chat about Solberg’s butterfly collection and Solberg’s vitrines full of exotic spiders and beetles. Solberg also has a big collection of guns over there, I happen to know, though he wasn’t showing them around. I kept saying we should do something, but nobody wanted to stay on the subject. It was as if they just wanted to express their horror at the whole thing, to show how normal they are, and have done with it. The truth is, I didn’t want to do anything about it either. But I felt that someone should.

Yes, but who –?

Someone Evan Greene would be afraid of.

I don’t know who that would be.

Tesseray?

Tesseray lives in another world. He spends all his time at body-building competitions as far as I can tell. When he needs something done, he sends this kid Bobo. When he pays me, the kid brings the check over. Or we subtract it from the rent. Nobody ever really sees Tesseray.

The police wrote them off as drug casualties. Still, you’d think having illegal drugs and paraphernalia in the house would have had some repercussions. The papers say he had important friends, that that’s why it all got buried at first. You have to wonder if it was that, or simply that the victims were Black. It wasn’t until their families went to the press that things came to a head.

 

dr richard balvet, 67, tenant of pequod cottage

People aren’t telling you all they know. That I can assure you. They want to distance themselves as much as possible. It’s understandable. It wasn’t their doing, so they resist any suggestion . . . Of course, that’s how I got pulled into this as the first doctor at hand, and even though it had nothing to do with me either, I’m not going to disown having any relationship to Evan Greene. I wouldn’t say he was a close friend, but we certainly spent time in each other’s company, in my place or his place, or on the grounds, we talked, I thought I knew him pretty well. He lived right there, everyone on the estate knew him to some degree. He was even something of a public figure. I mean in local politics, if you went to any public meeting of any interest, he would be there.

Did he speak a lot at any meetings you went to?

I think there was a zoning meeting and a city council meeting that was open to the public. He always had a lot to say. Much of it didn’t go down well. He harangued people who were speaking. I always had an odd feeling that . . . that he was ‘acting’. That he wanted to be seen as someone ‘passionate’ about his ideas, which were . . . convoluted, would be a way of describing it. I’m sure he believed in whatever he was voicing his opinions about, but there was also this slightly artificial edge to it. Wanting to be seen, wanting to be regarded in a certain way.

Evan Greene brought you both times to his place before calling the police?

He thought the men could be revived. The first time I went in more or less unawares, the second time I phoned the police or anyway tried to, as soon as he described the situation to me. I couldn’t get a signal. In both cases it was way too late for CPR or anything like that.

Can you talk about the first incident and what happened that night?

Well, there too, a lot of the news stories distorted things. Some of the neighbors have probably added to that. Contrary to what’s been written, Roderick Williams was living with Evan Greene. He was known to everybody on this estate. He was living here when he died. Whether he was a house guest or a roommate is irrelevant. Everyone knew him.

Jason Crosby too: he’d been staying with Evan Greene for at least two weeks before he overdosed. He left, I believe, for five or six days, and then came back late one afternoon, and died the same night.

But look, I’m pressed for time today. I have a meeting with my lawyer, unpleasantly enough. If you’re seriously interested in what happened I could possibly see you next week. We can discuss it over coffee. Preferably somewhere off the estate. Now that you’re known here, the village gossips will be taking note of all your comings and goings . . .

 

wesley carter, 34, research assistant

I went to the estate several times. Some of the tenants wanted to expand on their initial statements. But after a certain point, the subject of Evan Greene melted away somewhat. They talked around the subject. Their own lives and so forth dominated these conversations.

Did that happen naturally, or were they deliberately avoiding talking about Evan Greene in too much detail?

With some it was hard to tell. I think they became worried about saying something ‘on the record’ that might contradict what they had already sworn to in affidavits, or, who knows, might implicate them in some way. The Evan Greene business was very touchy. This in spite of knowing I was only drilling into it as the basis for a possible film script. On the other hand, this was right at the end of the pandemic. People had been stuck in their houses for months and desperate to resume some kind of social life. Even spilling out their personal shit to an investigator made a welcome change. As opposed to going mad from isolation. They didn’t care to talk about Evan Greene, but they loved talking about themselves.

And Balvet? Did you speak with him again?

I did. A few times. Never on the estate. He was intent on keeping his neighbors out of his business. I’m not sure they were that interested in Balvet. But he wanted to keep them uninterested. We met at a coffee shop in Silver Lake, not far from the estate, another time we took a long walk together in Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Another person with obsessive problems, though his seemed a lot more real than others. Theresa Lennox, for example, was a complete paranoiac, steeped in conspiracy theories.

Pepper Gillespie?

Well, look, it’s all in the notes and interviews I compiled. I’d rather you read through them and draw your own inferences from what’s in there, rather than listen to my third-hand paraphrasing of all that material. There are transcripts of the recordings I made, notes I took after every visit. I think you’ve got plenty there to work with, if you really think a viable script can come out of it. It would have to be an indie film, so-called, because a studio wouldn’t go near this stuff.

 

There’s always someone happy to do drugs with anybody who has an apartment. That seemed to be what Evan Greene had done, harvested interested persons out of polyester tents in freeway underpasses, or scooped them off Santa Monica Boulevard, promising to get them high, maybe promising other things, and whisked them back to his curious nautical cottage. Two of these fun-seeking friends, unfortunately, died on his premises. A third one ran half naked to a gas station, where police were called, and this individual said he’d been injected with drugs while unconscious. There is a legal way of describing Evan Greene’s life pod, which no news outlet failed to do, as a ‘drug house’, with penalties on that basis alone involving jail time . . .

When the story broke we all immediately thought of Daniel – whom some considered a friend, while others, like myself, tended to keep him at arm’s length, albeit in a friendly way. Daniel could be an oblivious, scarily effusive meth head when he was using. He once picked me up by the waist and swung me around someone’s living room like a hapless rag doll, in an excess of what he apparently considered affectionate high spirits, and I simply found obnoxious and frightening. Others liked him better, or at any rate put up with him with greater indulgence. I never knew what to do with my face when I caught Daniel’s attention. He brought his own face uncomfortably close to yours when he spoke to you, as if he intended to chew your nose off and suck out your eyeballs. He refused to let any gathering end, and if hard drugs could be brought into it to keep things going far into the next day, or the next week, so much the better from Daniel’s point of view. People who do meth often feel a need to do it with others; it’s a sociable drug, although it often leads to homicide. Daniel has been known, in the absence of anyone closer, to find transient drug pals in the jhuggi colonies that crop up all over any fallow stretch of land in Los Angeles.

Apparently, Evan Greene’s reputation as a methedrine candyman had spread among the city’s street-dwelling riffraff, particularly among men of color down on their luck, mainly young men of color, but some others too, older men of color, younger men of less color, it could go like that. Evan Greene was often too high to be picky about who he dragged home with him. It’s after three in the morning, you want to do speed with somebody else to get that nice orgiastic feeling going. Not that you’d be able to do anything especially orgiastic. As the Porter in Macbeth observes of drink, ‘it provokes the desire, but takes away the performance’. A drug friend could really be anybody. Not someone special (and then, as the song goes, I’m only me, not someone better, not someone good, I’d be a soldier, that’s if I only could . . .). Los Angeles is a physically big city, but a rather small conurbation when it comes to artists and writers, and people driven to extremes, if they didn’t start out in extremis in the first place. (I’m not counting actors, who take up so much space.) Word travels fast.

Evan Greene was sexually attracted to Black men. That much is established. But a few ‘in-depth’ stories in the press suggested that he also had contempt for the very people he was attracted to, that he sometimes, casually, used jarring racial slurs in conversation among Caucasian listeners. So the later explosion of outrage against him doesn’t seem unjustified, even if it looks cooked up from a cynical misreading of what actually occurred between Greene and his house guests. (Was it cynical? A question for later.) Apparently Greene could only gratify himself with men rendered fully passive after he shot them up with a combination of methedrine and other drugs, sedatives for the most part, men who lay on his polished living-room floor naked except for ‘tighty whitey’ underpants and white athletic socks. How he happened to locate men already clad in this under-attire when he brought them home has never been reported, and possibly Evan Greene was never questioned about it. Perhaps Evan Greene provided the socks and underpants. Whether Greene achieved any sort of sexual release in this situation also isn’t known, in fact it isn’t known whether Greene even made physical contact with these prone individuals, except while injecting their arms or other body parts. For all we know, he may have fondled their privates, fellated them, licked their testicles, rubbed his body against theirs, rimmed their anuses, or done other things to them, but nothing of this nature has been reported. We do know that he videotaped many of his sessions, encounters, whatever these episodes might be termed, but of course his videotape collection was confiscated by the police, so we really don’t know what he did or didn’t do with these men."

    "text": "It was late November, dark in the morning when I woke up and dark again by four in the afternoon, and if I then stepped out of the small cabin where I was, deep in the forest of Nordmarka near the capital of Norway, I wouldn’t have been able see my own hand in front of me.

I had spent a week in the cabin and had been hoping to stay there for longer in order to read, to catch up on sleep and to dream, but the University of Oslo Symphony Orchestra was giving its annual carol concert in the capital’s festival hall and I had promised a friend, who plays the viola, I’d go. Besides, I had just read that repetition is the reality and the seriousness of life, that repetition is the daily bread of everyday life, its blessing fills you up, and seeing as I had attended the orchestra’s carol concert for three years in a row, I hoped that it would indeed prove to be a blessing.

I packed my things and tidied up and when I drove down the steep hills from Ringkollen to Klekken, it started to snow. Large snowflakes twirled slowly in front of my windscreen and headlights making it hard to see and driving on the unlit, narrow, winding road demanded my full attention; soon the world would be dazzling, white and shimmering, and anything sharp and pointy would be smoothed over. It was something that happened every year at this time, it recurred and repetition is the reality and the seriousness of life. Hope is like a new garment – stiff, tight and glittering – but until you try it on, you won’t know if it fits or suits you, and memory is like an old garment: no matter how pretty it is, it no longer suits you, you have outgrown it. Repetition, however, is like a durable garment which hugs you tenderly, but never constricts or swamps you. I was glad that I hoped for nothing, but why then this feeling of dread?

It was dark again when I reached Sandvika because there had been no snowfall here as there had been on higher ground. I took the exit east to Oslo rather than west to Kristiansand and Nesøya as I usually did, joined the main road and became a part of the heavy Sunday-afternoon traffic crawling with agonising slowness towards the city centre. At long last I was able to park underneath the festival hall and I walked through windy, Sunday-empty streets towards the main entrance, past glum figures wrapped up in heavy parkas and dark scarves, bracing themselves against the icy wind. As I approached the hall, I saw several people waiting on the steps outside, the doors were not open yet so we had to wait, and waiting is challenging, especially in the cold; I wished for the time to pass quickly. We wish for time to pass quickly. We have one single life on this earth, a split-second of earthly existence in the endless expanse of time, and yet we don’t feel that it can pass quickly enough. Yes, I get it. It is hard to live your life in a way that matches that knowledge, perhaps it is impossible. I positioned myself so that no one could see my face, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath while I gave myself a reassuring talking-to, aware of the presence of my irritating, mortal fellow human beings, their breathing and the sounds they made when they moved, when they tried to keep warm by rubbing their arms, shifting their weight from one foot to another, how they moved up the steps as more people arrived, the queue compacted and closed up and it grew more crowded around the entrance, their impatience and their fears. There are no people anywhere else, only here on our little planet; there may well be plenty of intelligent life out there, but there are no people, not in any of the billions of galaxies, we are a rare and threatened species, and so wicked towards one another. I heard a metallic click, I opened my eyes and saw the heavy doors glide open before I entered as one of the first.

The instruments were set out on the stage; I took a seat so that I could see the viola, third row to the left, the same seat where I had sat the year before, another repetition. The audience surged in, but spoke quietly just like last year, this space commanded solemnity. We began to warm up, some people took off their coats, there were couples and pensioners, families with young children, an adult daughter with an old mother, an adult son with his parents and vice versa, I alone was on my own. Young children climbed up onto their parents’ laps, it made me emotional, I never went to a concert as a child, it wasn’t in my blood, how might my life have turned out if I had been to a concert as a child and it had been in my blood? Then perhaps what happened next wouldn’t have brought back the memory. There were empty seats to my right, a man stopped, behind him was a woman, behind her a girl aged fifteen or sixteen, their daughter, I thought, the invisible bonds vibrated. The man tapped the daughter’s shoulder and pointed to the seats, she nodded and went to sit next to me, her mother followed, then her father, there was just enough room for them, they were so close that I could feel the girl’s padded jacket against my arm, she wasn’t happy. I couldn’t insulate myself against her unhappy presence, she didn’t want to be there, she had been made to come, squeezed in between her mother and a strange woman, staring at the programme while her mother looked at her with disapproval because she wasn’t happy, because she wasn’t grateful, her mother exchanged knowing glances with her father, no matter what they did, the girl wasn’t happy, she wouldn’t be happy, she stared at the programme in silent protest. At six o’clock the doors were closed, the lights dimmed, the musicians entered, I waved to the viola player, the hum in the auditorium died down. The conductor took a bow, everything was silence and anticipation, the hands of the girl next to me with her eyes on the programme trembled as did mine, the conductor turned to the orchestra, raised the baton and the music began.

Carols from northern Norway, Blessed be the day over the fjords, Blessed be the light over land, the girl’s mother wriggled out of her coat, unwrapped the chequered Burberry scarf from around her neck, folded it on her lap and patted it with restless hands, she didn’t want to be there either, she was there for the girl’s sake, but the girl wasn’t grateful. The father had bought expensive tickets so the family could have a nice time together before Christmas, but the girl wasn’t happy. God’s peace upon the mountain and hill, God’s peace upon the animals in the stall. The mother leaned towards the girl and whispered: Take off your jacket, she pinched her through it, bowed down to her ear, elbowed her, whispered more loudly: Take off your jacket. The girl closed her eyes, her mother hissed her name, my name, a hard sound, but the girl didn’t want to take off her jacket, she was hiding inside it and that was why her mother wanted her to take it off, draw her out from her hiding place, her shelter, We are unyielding, just like you, You bless with eternal words, The people who live here in the north, we clapped, the girl didn’t clap. Her mother glanced at her father who shook his head. O holy night, I couldn’t take my eyes off them. The mother tugged at the girl’s jacket, harder this time and closer to her, intruding on her personal space, why was that jacket so important? Because it had turned into a battle which the mother had to win. The girl unzipped the jacket, her mother yanked at a sleeve, her parents paid the bills, they paid for her keep although it couldn’t cost them much given how thin she was, but they had paid for her jacket and could make demands, and no one else, the friends I hoped she had, was there, she was forced to be alone with her parents and for their benefit at the University Symphony Orchestra’s carol concert so that they could exercise their power and feel reassured. Something had happened, something terrible had happened the week before which had to be fixed, which had to be mended, her parents needed it to be. The mother’s threatening gaze and a sudden gesture from the father that signalled: Take off that damn jacket! The girl slowly peeled the padded jacket off her left shoulder with her right hand, her elbow came near my elbow, she eased the jacket over her right shoulder using her left hand, but she didn’t pull her arms out of the sleeves and the jacket ended up stretched across her back, half off, half on, like a weird straitjacket. She bowed her head towards the programme and closed her eyes, I could see that she was crying. She was trapped and paralysed and she couldn’t stay where she was without foundering, but neither did she have anywhere to go or anyone to turn to, she was fifteen or sixteen years old and dependent. I wanted to put my arm around her and whisper in her ear that everything would be all right, but I couldn’t know that, it probably wouldn’t, it didn’t look like it, and nothing I could say would take away her pain, Lovely is the Earth. I could do nothing for her, and even if I could, it wouldn’t have made any difference because the people she longed to be understood by, the ones at whom her anxious hope was pinned, were her parents. Generations will follow the course of generations, and we are tied to our family from our first breath to our last, and the last carol had been played and we clapped and got up and the girl pulled her jacket back over her shoulders and they walked out in front of me, three lost, unhappy people, hopelessly entangled. Concert-goers pushed and shoved impatiently from all sides because life couldn’t happen fast enough and I lost sight of them in the crowd. The musicians had gone backstage, but I didn’t join them to say hello to the viola player, instead I stepped out into the cold and the dark while the girl continued to prey on my mind. I didn’t go to the island where my house is as I had planned, but drove back to the forest because Grøndals vei had returned to me; my last November in the first-floor maisonette in Grøndals vei came back, the place where I spent my formative years, as people say, a lower-middle-class area on the lower side of Tåsenveien. On the upper side of the mighty Tåsenveien were smart villas with large gardens while on the lower side were smaller houses with smaller gardens and several terraced houses and below them again the housing blocks for workers from the nail factory. On my first day of school we were asked to draw the place where we lived; later I wondered if the reason was that our drawings would tell our teacher a great deal about each child’s socio-cultural background as I guess you would call it today."

    "text": "Naturally, no partnership is perfect. Certain pieces will be at odds – you’ll have that. With these two, the oddities were a lot to do with generational frictions. Hern disliked hearing people younger than him cuss and he would dog curse Ricks on the infrequent occasions when Ricks ever did cuss, whereas, on the other hand, Hern was in the habit of using the N-word and Ricks had been taught to internalize his racism. But they made it work because they were the police and they had a job to do.

They’d been partners three weeks, the morning Hern told Ricks to pull onto the side street. There was a space in front of a fire hydrant next to an old church. Ricks parked the Charger and Hern got out and raided the clothes donation bin, returning with an outfit: an old, raw-wool pullover; a turquoise pair of lined parachute pants; and a black, oversized, trench coat.

‘If you’re ever going to be a proper narc, you’re gonna need some undercover experience, and I think you’re ready. I’ve got the go-ahead for you to infiltrate Lomax High. Put these on.’

‘Is this a prank, Sergeant? – a high school?’

‘This is no prank, Ricks. A lot of guys started their undercover careers this way. You know who Donnie Brasco is?’

‘It’s one of the DVDs in the Stress Room.’

‘Brasco was a real guy. He got his start undercover at a high school.’

‘Don’t kid me, Hern.’

‘Search Donnie Brasco if you don’t believe me.’

‘How do you spell his name?’

‘Like it sounds, Donnie with an i-e, not a y . . . Then space, B–r–a,’ Hern had anticipated Ricks might buck at the assignment, so he had edited the Wikipedia page for Donnie Brasco, ‘. . . s-c . . . o, that’s right . . . What does it say, Ricks?’

‘Uh . . . says, Donnie Brasco . . . a lot of stuff . . . hold on . . . conducted his first undercover sting operation assignment at . . . Lomax High School in the 1960s. Wow, I guess you were right.’

‘Apology accepted. Pop the trunk.’

 

They exited the vehicle. Hern lifted the trunk lid. Ricks said, ‘We’ve been driving around with drugs in the trunk of the G-car this whole time?’

Hern said, ‘We’re the laws, Ricks. What could possibly go wrong?’

‘Yeah, wow . . . it’s just that . . . this is a lot of dope though, right?’

‘There are over a thousand students enrolled at Lomax High School. Try using common sense.’

‘This is like . . . three, four, six, eight, nine – nine big things of drugs.’

‘It should be ten. Wait. No. Right, it’s supposed to be nine because of another thing I have to do.’

‘What kind of drugs is it, Sergeant?’

‘Its essence is carfentanil.’

‘You’re not serious – fentanyl?’

‘Carfentanil, Ricks. Much stronger, made for elephants, like for when you’re doing surgery on an elephant but you don’t want the elephant to feel any pain. Don’t worry, you’re going to get to step on it some more before you go and intent-to-distribute it to these kids. There’s a video for how to do it.’ Hern tapped into his phone. ‘You’ve got the link . . . now.’

Ricks’s smartphone went ding.

‘Give them free tastes in the morning if they don’t want to buy and check back with them in the afternoon. By the afternoon, you’ll be able to do whatever you want to them. Have fun with it. It’s supposed to be fun.’

‘We really have the go-ahead for this?’

‘It’s called budgets are up for renewal and we’re not the only ones who are out here doing shit like this right now today, I bet.’

 

Ricks went to close the trunk.

Hern said, ‘Don’t. Here, put the drugs in this duffle bag. We want to be sure it all fits.’

‘Sergeant, isn’t this stuff supposed to be dangerous even to touch?’

‘You fucking moron.’

‘What?’

‘I put the dope in the trunk, Ricks. I fucking did, and I’m fine. Do you really want to ask me about this fake bullshit or do you want to ask me about something real? What are we really talking about right now?’

‘I’m cool. It’s just that there’s a lot of drugs here for a high school. Like, how many kids are we trying to kill do you think?’

‘Relax, this is mostly cocaine. This is what cocaine smells like, or what it smells like when Crime Lab give it back to you with too much ether in it.’ Hern slammed the trunk closed. ‘Why do you think they call it Vice Squad, Ricks?’

‘Because we focus on vice?’

‘Shit. Fine. Do you know Willy? – big, tall guy on Homicide Squad’s softball team, bats lefty.’

‘The first baseman.’

‘Finally, he knows something.’

‘He plays first base.’

‘Jesus, fuck, we heard you. Way to fucking ruin it.’

‘My bad.’

‘Shut up.’

‘I’m sorry.’

Hern drew his gun, casual-like, like something fatalistic were in the works.

‘Now, you remember what I said about the budgets are up for renewal.’

‘I do.’

‘Amazing. But you don’t know what it means.’

‘It means how much money we get.’

Hern racked a round. There was already a round in the chamber. It popped out and landed on the street and rolled toward the gutter. Hern jabbed his gun toward it. ‘Do me a favor and pick that up for me.’

Ricks turned to fetch the bullet. He thought: how’m I supposed to know what this SOB wants me to act like? – I’m here to do a job, get a paycheck, go home, buy a barbecue, find my Mrs Right, host Super Bowl parties, and now I’ve got this old man, this grouch, who’s supposed to be my partner, my mentor, my guide, he thinks he can talk to me like any old way and I guess I’m just supposed to take it off him, when I’m pretty sure I could beat his ass in a fight . . .

 

Ricks was steamed. He was so steamed he didn’t clock how Hern was following a step behind him on his way to the gutter, until Hern brought the butt of his pistol down on Ricks’s dominant shoulder, where it met with the neck, just as Ricks was coming back up with the bullet. The butt of the gun came down hard enough to drop Ricks to his knees.

Ricks yowled. Both in pain and in real fear of his life. His partner stepped around to the front of him, smiling a grim way that Ricks hadn’t seen him smile before.

‘What are you doing to me, Sergeant?’

‘Open your mouth.’

‘Nope –’

Hern grabbed Ricks by the forelock and shoved the pistol into Rick’s mouth and said:

‘Look into my eyes. This is not a game. This is not a test. This is initiation. If you look away from my eyes even for a second, I’m going to shoot you in your brain, knock that brain right out of your retarded head. Blink twice if you understand me.’

Ricks blinked twice and then looked away.

Hern yanked the pistol and whipped him on the eye: ‘Last chance. My eyes, you pussy-ass gump. Don’t think about looking away! Don’t think about it because I’ll know and I’m a son of a bitch. That’s what you wanted to call me, wasn’t it? Blink twice if you wanted to call me a son of a bitch just now.’

Ricks blinked twice. Hern said, ‘I can read your mind, Ricks. I can read you like a book, like a gay little book. I know you better than you know yourself. Blink twice if you believe me.’

Ricks blinked twice.

‘Now put my gun back in your mouth . . . Don’t touch it with your hands. Bring your mouth to my gun. Remember, you’re looking in my eyes.’

Ricks scuttled forward on his knees. He had to duck his head funny because Hern was holding the gun too low for what they were supposed to be doing. Ricks didn’t break eye contact. Hern was staring back at Ricks, with dead eyes and a grim smile. The split above the corner of Ricks’s eye was stinging something fierce. Blood was running down warm to cool against his red-hot cheek.

Why do bad things always happen to me?

Is it really me doing them to myself?

 

Hern said to him, ‘You minced-up little beta cuck. Your father would be ashamed of you if he ever gave a rat’s ass and he wasn’t chopped up in a goddamn hole full of lime someplace overseas. Don’t get me started on that shitbird. At least he knew how to act like a man. For all his faults, he was a chad. I can say that because I’m a chad. I doubt I’ll ever say it about you. Blink twice because I said so . . . Good job, Ricks. You’re doing such a good job. We were talking about budgets, weren’t we?’

‘Yeah,’ Ricks said. Except it didn’t sound like yeah on account of the gun back in his mouth. It sounded like baa.

‘I’m going to be honest with you, Ricks. We’re only this far into our partnership, and I despise you. I think you’re a worm. I actually have more respect for worms than I do for you. Worms don’t embarrass me. Yet as much as I’d like to put you out of your misery, you’re my partner and I’m not in the mood to be explaining shit to anybody today. Besides, if anything, I like to think of myself as an educator.’

Hern took his piece out of Rick’s mouth, being careful this time to not fuck up Ricks’s teeth. He holstered the piece under his arm, and waited for Ricks to get up so he could see into his eyes better.

Ricks wasn’t up to his feet straight away. His knees hurt him and his back was stiff from leaning forward. His bell was rung from the hits he had taken.

Whatever you do, don’t cry, don’t let him see you cry, you’ll make him mad again and he’ll lose respect for you.

 

‘You know, that was unfortunate,’ Hern said. ‘But I had to scare the shit out of you, because I’m about to tell you something not a lot of people realize, and I need you to understand that if you fuck up and breathe a word about it to anybody I will kill you like a dog.’

Ricks spit and wiped his chin: ‘So what’s up?’

‘The first baseman.’

‘Willy.’

‘Yes, Willy the first baseman. You know him.’

‘I know who he is.’

‘Back when I was on Homicide Squad, whenever budgets were up for renewal, Willy would mask up and push white women in front of trains. Has anybody ever told you that about Willy?’

Ricks swallowed: ‘This is the first I’ve heard of it.’

‘Well that’s what Willy does, Ricks, and it’s a lot of what he does. It’s what he did the whole time I was on Homicide Squad and he was already doing it when I got there. Willy’s a professional. He knows the job. If a budget’s up for renewal, Willy’s destroying all the office furniture, killing the plants in the office, then he orders more new shit to replace the shit he stole, until not one penny’s gone unspent. Then he’s out there pushing white women in front of trains, in front of busses, taxicabs, tripping them down flights of stairs, knocking them out in elevators from time to time randomly – and not because he wants to. He’s a regular guy, a decent guy. I think he has kids, but above all Willy is a professional, so he’s going to be out in the streets right now, trying to secure every last red cent of the pie he can get allocated to Homicide Squad. He’s out there doing it as we speak, I bet, while we’re wasting precious time standing here talking about him.’

    "text": "Luke was forty-five years old, and in all his life he’d almost never viewed pornography in any form. There had been a year in his late twenties, a time of professional failure, in which he’d developed a fondness for a photo on Playboy’s landing page: a woman in the shower, adorned with suds wrung from her loofah. But that was it. He was never tempted to give it another try. He never asked his wife, Rita, to describe the videos she watched in her study with the door closed and her earbuds in. He rarely spoke of his abjuration because he didn’t want to lord it over anyone, and because he doubted any of his friends would believe him.

Once, he mentioned it to his best friend Elijah, while they were cooking dinner in an Airbnb in the Catskills. Their wives had taken the car to a meditation class at a hillside ashram. He half expected Elijah to say something like, I never look at it either, this whole myth about male porn consumption is bullshit. But Elijah’s face darkened. He scraped the seeds from a bell pepper and refused to meet Luke’s eyes. To show Elijah he wasn’t bragging, Luke said, ‘I’m five years older than you, and my parents are hippies, so I didn’t have internet when I was in high school. I’m not saying I have superior willpower. I’m just lucky I didn’t get hooked when I was a kid.’ Elijah did not dignify this remark with a response.

Maybe Luke was bragging. Sometimes, running in the park, he wondered if he was the last of a dying breed. Over the years, a few different women he’d dated had told him his disinterest in porn was unusual and endearing. Those compliments had confirmed that his rejection of porn was more than a personal choice, something more like a talent, an asset. Then, early in his courtship with Rita, she said, ‘I feel like your not watching porn is why you like my body so much and why you have sex slightly differently from other guys.’ He wished it were feasible to tattoo that statement on his neck. In moments of distress – when he missed a fundraising goal at work or glanced at a bank statement – he whispered it to himself, like a prayer. Looking at porn became as unimaginable as shoplifting, or going to business school, an act that would undermine his sense of self.

One morning, when Rita was nearing the end of her first round of IVF, she reminded him, over breakfast, that on the day the doctors extracted the eggs from her ovaries, he would have to go into a room in the hospital and produce. Last month he’d produced the sample for his semen analysis at home, put the sterile cup in a tote bag, and delivered it to the clinic. But this time was going to be different. Weill Cornell rules dictated that all production for purposes of fertilization, as opposed to testing, take place on site, right before the woman went under twilight anesthesia.

Luke drank down his orange juice. ‘It’s weird they don’t send couples into the room together, given what they need the guy to do.’

‘I never thought about that,’ said Rita. ‘That is weird.’ Suddenly, she looked concerned. ‘You realize,’ she said, ‘there’s going to be porn in the room.’

‘Of course. Who cares?’ The truth was, he hadn’t thought about it. But he wasn’t worried. It wasn’t as if he never masturbated. He just thought about Rita and his ex-girlfriends when he did it, and he could do that in the presence of a blank computer screen. Compared to what Rita was going through, his job was so easy it wasn’t a job. She had to: inject herself every evening with multiple medications, including Menopur, an ovary stimulant whose active ingredient was distilled from the urine of post-menopausal women; refrain from exercise; and walk around all day with ovaries so swollen she could feel them jounce. And that was to say nothing of her psychological burden. Their insurance didn’t cover IVF; Rita was a therapist in private practice and Luke worked for an ocean-conservation nonprofit whose employee association had given up fertility assistance, among other benefits, in exchange for flexible hours and a permissive work-from-home policy. To pay for round one, he’d raided his 403(b), Rita her 401(k). A round two would mean either the hunnish sacking of those accounts or the assumption of debt and the death of the dream of home ownership. A round three was out of the question. The prospect of a childless life did not appall Luke. It sounded empty and free. But for Rita, it was the stuff of nightmares. One early morning last month she’d gasped and bolted upright in bed. He’d asked her what she’d been dreaming about.

‘Not being able to have a baby.’

 

The next day, a sonogram revealed that the follicles housing Rita’s oocytes had grown to auspicious size. It was time to trigger ovulation. That night, she drew a circle in black marker high on her left buttock and Luke knelt behind her, jabbed her with a long-needled syringe, holding it like a pencil, and drove home the plunger with his thumb, pushing the chemicals through the barrel into her muscle.

Thirty-five hours later, they were in the waiting room. Rita wore a pre-op robe, non-slip socks, a surgical cap, and hospital pajamas two sizes too large for her. A nurse escorted a man Luke’s age down the hall to The Room, and the man returned ten minutes later. The nurse escorted another man Luke’s age down the hall, and this man took longer to produce, about fifteen minutes. Finally, she called Luke’s name. He squeezed Rita’s hand and followed the nurse down the corridor.

The nurse was stone-faced and silent as she swiped a card against a reader on the wall. The doors at the end of the corridor swung open to welcome them into a secure inner sanctum of the fertility wing. She turned left, opened another door with a key, stepped into a dim chamber, and beckoned.

The room was the size of a cubicle. A urinal was bolted to one of the yellow cinderblock walls. To the right of the urinal there was a paper-towel dispenser, to the left a sink and a mirror. On a fake marble countertop, left of the sink, stood a monitor that displayed a menu of six videos, represented by six still frames of men and women captured in the midst of sexual acts, each option with a title: COMBAT ZONE; MOTHERLOAD FACIALS; DOUBLE-PENETRATION BLONDES; BLONDE AMBITION; 19-YO CUM-LICKERS; BLONDE ASS-BANG. ‘Videos,’ said his Virgil, gesturing with her gloved hand, touching nothing. She indicated a rack of capped vials. ‘Lube.’ She pointed to a blue leatherette recliner facing the monitor. ‘The chair.’ The recliner’s seat was covered with a large rectangular pad, made of disposable, absorbent, synthetic cloth. ‘Magazines,’ she said, pointing to a low, black, filing cabinet. ‘When you’re done, look at the time.’ On the digital wall clock, hours and minutes were eight inches high. Seconds flashed away in miniature. ‘Record the time of production on the label of the cup.’ She placed the sample cup beside a jar of pens. ‘Once you’ve recorded the production time, put the cup in here.’ She showed him a safe embedded in the wall, and a red button to push when he was ready to return to the waiting room. He thanked her. She left and shut the door, leaving him alone with the computer.

Dazed by the violence of the still images drawn from the videos, he treated the monitor like a touch screen, pressing on the menu icon with his index finger to try to make the pictures disappear. In a way, they belonged here, in this house of appendectomies, biopsies, shunts, and debridement. Every vulva was shaved bare. The two anuses were wide open, one filled with a cock, the other empty, a black hole. The women’s mouths, too, were agape, as if for intubation. The faces of the men were the faces of surgeons at their work, detached and focused, and the light was the light of an operating room, every fold and vein illuminated. Finally, he found a remote on the counter. He hit what looked like a power button several times and soon the pictures were gone, replaced by a night shot of the Manhattan skyline.

He turned on the cold water, washed his face, pissed in the urinal, and washed his hands. He washed his face again and ran the cold water through his hair. It was possible that the man who’d used this facility before him, the fifteen-minute guy, was a perv. Maybe the images on the screen reflected his personal search history and idiosyncratic taste, rather than the default choices to which the menu reverted. There was no reason to despair of the human race. There were all kinds of people out there. Everyone knew that porn, these days, fed every conceivable appetite. And of course he’d known that a lot of porn was brutal and degrading. But there was a difference between knowing this to be true and seeing it. The shock would not have been a big deal, really, but for the time-sensitive nature of the task before him. There were seven or eight other couples in the waiting room, each with their own slot on the schedule. Every woman needed to go into surgery thirty-six hours after her ovulation trigger and required the semen of her male collaborator. He could not hold up the works. He would overcome this ridiculous blow to his faith in the goodness of others, and provide.

He stripped, sat on the absorbent pad, and closed his eyes. He put his hands between his legs. It felt like rubbing his ear. He tried to remember the loud, low sound one of his ex-girlfriends made when she came. Okay: this was the beginning of arousal, modest progress. But his memory of the stills from the videos was a floodlight that blotted out the stars. His little erection seemed almost to recoil as it contracted and fell. He could hear the traffic of nurses in the corridor. He looked at the big digital numbers. Five minutes had passed.

Why was it that he couldn’t forget his glimpse of COMBAT ZONE, MOTHERLOAD FACIALS, and the rest of the collection? Maybe this was how people got addicted to porn in the first place; its violence, its car-crash quality, was there to make it indelible. If the stills had been tableaux of lovers engaged in humane, mutual gratification, they would have been easier to banish from the mind. Seven minutes had passed. He thought of the cash they’d dropped on this round, thirty-one thousand dollars on the line.

Maybe he was thrown by the images from the porn because they played on his most shameful fantasies. This thing of darkness I acknowledge mine, he thought, striving to unleash and nurture some heretofore chastised inner frat bro. Still, no stirring in the loins. Thirty-one thousand dollars was a vast understatement if you considered how the money would have multiplied over decades, had it remained in mutual funds, where it belonged. Ten minutes had passed. The foot traffic outside sounded closer to the door than ever, and he wondered if the nurses were circling, ready to give him a five-minute warning. Nobody knocked. But he knew the nurses and the other men were out there. They were depending on him to get it done and leave.

He stood and looked at his naked body in the mirror. He concocted elaborate fantasies, of sacramental sex, ceremonies in tents. In a few minutes, he was hard. But the expression that came over his face when he imagined himself partaking in an ancient ritual reminded him of the scowl of the ogre in BLONDE AMBITION. Once more, he watched a fledgling erection flag in his hand. He lowered himself back onto the pad. Fifteen minutes had passed, and then twenty.

He was stalling the rotation of men through the room to such a degree that he was almost certainly reducing other couples’ chances of conception. His penis was raw and cowering, his progress negative. He varied his movements and tried to empty his mind. Now thirty minutes had passed. Why was he so unmanned by his glimpse of what other men liked? Perhaps if he could understand the reason the still frames had robbed him of his potency, he could wrest his potency back. The problem, he speculated, was that he liked to feel superior to other men. That was why his dick would not stoop so low as to respond positively to porn, as an average dick would. Turning up its nose at coarse, misogynistic imagery, that is, at the peasant fare upon which average dicks feasted, was an assertion of its refined, aristocratic nature. Now that he had figured out what was going on, maybe he could be a dick-whisperer. He literally whispered, to his dick and to himself, ‘There’s nothing wrong with being like everybody else. There’s nothing wrong with being like everybody else.’ But the fact was, he did think there was something wrong with it. He couldn’t get turned on by the still frames because, deep down, he didn’t want to be turned on by them. And yet he could not push them out of his head. Forty minutes.

The time had come to face facts. It was a terrible thing. But it would do no good to pretend the situation was otherwise. His hands trembled as he picked up his belt, with its once-fashionable rodeo buckle, and laced his boots.

When he pushed open the door of the waiting room, Rita waved, and held out an arm to welcome him. He sat beside her on one of the plastic chairs and took her hand.

‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘I couldn’t do it.’

She wore an N-95 because she was worried that if she caught Covid, or the flu, or a cold, it would compromise her fertility. The only exposed part of her face was her eyes. She blinked, twice.

‘Sweetie,’ she said. ‘You haven’t done it yet. But you’re going to do it now.’

He released her hand, stared at the floor, and scratched the back of his neck.

‘I believe in you,’ she said, sounding desolate and frightened. ‘You’re going to get back in there, and you’re not going to come back out until you’re finished.’

‘All of these people,’ he said, ‘are waiting to go. They need the room, too.’

‘Which is why you need to go back right now, before the nurses think you’re done and send in somebody else.’

‘But I’ve taken too much time already. I can’t do anything at all.’

‘Is it the porn?’ she asked.

He nodded. ‘They left it on the screen.’

‘Okay,’ she said. ‘I can see how that would be weird for you. I know that you’re pure in certain ways. It’s one of the reasons I love you. But you need to get turned on, any way you can. Have you tried using the porn?’

He shook his head.

‘I think you should try it. You need to find a way to have fun in there.’ She stroked his hair. ‘I know that it’s a new thing for you. But I think that if you keep an open mind, you’re going to have fun.’

He took a deep breath. He focused on the soothing touch of her hand. ‘Fun.’

‘That’s right,’ she said. ‘Can you try to have fun? Will you do that for me?’

‘I’m going to do it,’ he said. ‘I’m going to have a good time.’

She seized the arm of a passing nurse. ‘He needs to try again,’ she said.

 

Back in the room, he took off his clothes and resettled himself on the crinkling pad. It was a matter of turning into a different person for a few minutes. He pulled open the drawer of the cabinet full of magazines. On the top of the pile lay Just Barely 18. The cover girl, who wore a thong, braced herself against a gymnasium wall, turning to regard the viewer with a guileless expression that emphasized her status as a child. He threw it on the floor and looked at the next one, Barely Legal. He wondered if Barely Legal had ever brought an intellectual property case against Just Barely 18. He threw it on the floor. Next was Hustler, which was like the video stills, in print form. He threw it on the floor, and it skidded over the others. Beneath Hustler, at the bottom of the pile, lay a hard-used Playboy, its cover torn off.

The Girl of the Big Ten, a brunette, hailed from Wisconsin. She was corn-fed, wholesome. Naked on her stomach, casual, on a nondescript bed, she was propped up on her elbows in the fashion of a person reading a book or scrolling on a phone. She regarded the camera with an indulgent, irritable smile. All the other women in the magazine were odalisques, but this one attended an excellent land-grant university, and her attitude was one of thinly veiled disdain. Her posture and face reminded him of Rita’s disposition after an argument. And so in his imaginary coupling with the Girl, they had recently argued, and sex was their way of beating swords into plowshares.

‘It’s okay,’ she said, with her wry mouth, her arched eyebrows. ‘I know you get stressed about work sometimes. And then you get dark. But I don’t care. It’s because you work so hard. There are so few people at the good NGOs who are so fucking good at operations and strategy. When I really think about it, I don’t think there’s anyone who’s as good at them as you are. It’s true you fucked up, a little, in this room, today. But I fuck up sometimes, too. I’ll admit that. I’m driven to be so good. Sometimes I get so dark, just like you.’ And she assured him, over and over, for five minutes, that it felt good to fuck, because he was so good, the best in the world, at everything she cared about, and because he made her life better with his competence.

The climax was so feeble it barely took place, but it sent him into ecstasies of relief. He and Rita were going to have a baby. It might have her red hair, her wide nose, her narrow eyes. Or, if they didn’t have a baby, it would not be his fault. He screwed the lid onto the cup and committed the hour and minute to the label in a faint, trembling hand. The numbers looked as if they’d been written by a stranger.

 

Two hours later Rita was released from the hospital. They walked to the subway with her hand on his arm, slow, almost shuffling. Her ovaries hurt, and her cramps were getting worse as the fentanyl wore off, but she was elated. The doctor had harvested ten eggs, a good haul, considering Rita’s age. It was likely that half would fertilize, and half of those would grow to blastocysts. Of the two or three likely blastocysts, it was probable that one would test genetically normal, and thus qualify for transfer to her uterus. Once implanted there, it would have a 65 percent chance of resulting in pregnancy. She rattled off these odds, already a specialist in the field.

She spoke of the future. In two weeks, she’d be allowed to exercise and have sex again. But not for long. If they were lucky, the
transfer would take place in a little more than a month, and then she’d have to be careful, in deference to her age and the delicacy of the first trimester.

‘I knew porn was pretty fucked up, but I didn’t realize how fucked up,’ he said.

‘Yeah,’ she said. ‘To find attractive people, I usually have to look at terrible shit. Did you know that the women sometimes surgically remove part of their labia?’

‘The genitals didn’t look like real genitals.’

‘What did you watch to get off ? You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to.’

He told her.

‘That’s not even porn.’

‘What’s Playboy if not porn?’

‘What people mean by porn these days is different from that. With a video, it can surprise you. Last week I was watching what seemed like shitty, heterosexual, anal-sex porn, and I assumed the woman was faking it, and then she started touching herself and shaking, and it was like, Holy shit, I think she’s really having an orgasm. Other times, I’ve been having a decent experience, and suddenly I’ve looked at the woman more closely, and been like, Oh my God, am I watching a person getting raped?’

‘When we have sex, and you tell me your fantasies, are they from porn?’ he asked.

‘Sometimes.’ She studied his face, amused. ‘You’re getting an education. You look a little traumatized.’ They rode an escalator down a long way underground, and then another one even deeper. On the train, a woman walked from car to car selling candy from a cardboard box, saying ‘chicle, chocolate’ over and over in a quiet voice. She had a boy in tow, four or five years old. Twice, he knelt on the seats and tugged at a strap of her backpack, calling to her in vain.

 

The next day was bright and very cold. The tiny mounds of snow on the sidewalk were hard and glimmering. Luke stepped over patches of ice on his way to the bakery. At eleven o’clock that morning, Rita looked at a number on her phone and picked up. She paced and covered her free ear. The only sound she made was an occasional ‘okay’. She said thank you, hung up, and stared at the wall.

‘Who was that?’

She looked at him for a moment before she spoke. ‘Only two of them fertilized.’

They sat at the dining-room table. She was hunched as if ill.

‘What’s going to happen?’ he asked.

‘Maybe we’ll get one blastocyst. But, if we do, it probably won’t be genetically normal, because most of them aren’t, when you’re my age. So, nothing.’ She went into the bedroom, kicked off her shoes, and lay on her back with her hands over her eyes.

He followed her in, and held the balls of her feet, in their threadbare socks. She spoke of the grief she felt for the baby girl she’d imagined, and tried to visualize her fading and disappearing, like a ghost, so she wouldn’t think about her anymore.

‘We did everything we could have done,’ he said.

‘Did we? I’m not sure that’s true. If you’d been able to jerk off without panicking, things might have been different. Stress affects sperm quality. I googled it, but I didn’t tell you, because I didn’t want to stress you out about getting stressed.’

‘Obviously,’ he said, ‘they mean stress over days, and weeks, and months. But, I mean, yeah, the orgasm was really bad. The cup looked like a gnome had jizzed in it.’

‘You know what? I don’t find that funny right now. I find that upsetting. There was a study where men who took longer than twenty minutes to produce made fewer viable sperm than other men. So I’m not sure what to say to you.’

‘You’re making me feel like shit,’ he said. ‘You’re forty-one. That’s the problem.’

She lifted her hands and sat up. ‘I made ten eggs.’

‘Wow. Ten fucked-up, middle-aged ovary eggs that have little to no hope of ever becoming a human being. You must be really proud of yourself.’

‘I’m glad we’re doing IVF,’ she said. ‘We just burned up thirty-one grand, but at least I don’t have to fuck you.’

The two of them adopted the same tone of voice, one of conspicuous self-control, non-shouting. He said he didn’t want to have a baby with someone who found him repulsive. She flinched and said that it was hard not to experience a little resentment when she’d had to coax him into doing what every other man in that waiting room seemed to be able to do; he said that it wasn’t his fault that the hospital was set up for men who used porn; she said that she wished he could have looked at some porn ahead of time, having been warned, by her, that it was going to be present in the room, and that she wished the pride he took in being the last non-porn-contaminated American man could have been weighed against other considerations.

 

Aday passed without conversation. Luke brushed his teeth at the kitchen sink to avoid standing beside Rita in the bathroom and weathering her refusal of eye contact. In bed, she donned her wax earplugs and face-mask and turned away from him, curled on her side. When his alarm went off in the morning, he rushed to work, even though he wasn’t required to go to the office that day. He came home to find Rita seated at the butcherblock kitchen island, eating microwave popcorn. She addressed him as he took off his coat.

‘I don’t have the luxury of staying angry,’ she said. ‘I called Dr Licavoli. She doesn’t think either of the embryos has much chance of making it to blastocyst. She said it’s best if we start another round as soon as we can, in two weeks, when I have my period.’

‘So we need to come up with the money now.’

She nodded. ‘She said it might have been your sperm that fucked us but it might have been my eggs. That’s why we need to hurry. I’m not getting any younger.’

They ordered takeout, shut themselves in the study, and devised entreaties, taking turns at the keyboard and gesturing with chopsticks at the document on the screen, like a screenwriting team. Her parents, like his, were divorced bohemians threatening to outlive their nest eggs, whose growth had been stunted by leftist lapses of faith in the financial system, investments in gold and ethical portfolios. Two of their four parents had romantic partners who discouraged them from giving money to their children, and the other two lacked the means. They were all potential lenders, in other words, not potential donors. But they needed to be massaged as if they were the latter, given the astronomical sums involved. The email drafts proposed interest rates and schedules of repayment. They promised access to any resulting grandchild so unfettered it was tantamount to custody; and they stated, in euphemistic but unambiguous terms, that principal and interest would be mailed in hard cash, undetectable to the IRS. (‘We are very comfortable with large bills and padded envelopes, if you are.’) No lawyers, no paper trail. In all likelihood, they would never own an apartment, not on this coastline. But they would be able to service their debts and save up for day care, if they managed to have a baby in the end. When they were done, Rita went into the bedroom and called her mother, and then two of her best friends. He could hear her crying through the wall.

Afterward, he paced the kitchen and read her the drafts they’d composed, and she nodded, her back against the fridge, her head cocked to one side. She said she’d already broached the subject of a loan with her mother, who seemed receptive.

‘Good work,’ he said.

‘You too.’ They embraced but avoided eye contact. This reminded him of cats. ‘Say we get all the money,’ she said. ‘It’s round two. How do we know there won’t be another crisis in the porn room?’

‘I’ll take something in there. Something to distract me from the atmosphere.’

‘You mean a toy? A magazine?’

He shrugged.

‘You need to think about it,’ she said. ‘Because we need it to work. I never want to go through that suspense in the waiting area again. That was hell. I think it’s going to be hard for you, because you’re going to be under even more pressure this time. This is the last stand for the Rita–Luke baby. We’re both going to feel it.’

He deliberated. ‘If I’m being honest,’ he said, ‘what would be most helpful would be for you to film yourself on your phone. Just go into the bedroom, take off your clothes, and jerk off. Maybe you could say something to me while you do it, but only if you feel inspired. If I could have that to watch, that would be the closest thing to taking you in there.’

She winced. ‘Interesting.’

‘I’m sorry,’ he said. ‘It’s just that I find porn disgusting, because I’m not used to it, and so, if you want something that’s going to work –’

‘I get it. I have zero libido right now, because of the meds. But I’ll do it.’

‘I know it’s hard to get all the way there,’ he said, ‘when you’re being asked to get yourself all the way there.’

She shrugged. ‘I can do it.’

He averted his eyes in shame, and then looked at her to see what she was doing. She opened a cupboard and took down a mug decorated with a faded flag of the Faroe Islands, where they’d gone on their final vacation, two years ago, before they’d started to squirrel everything away. She studied the contents of a tin. ‘We’re out of green tea,’ she said. ‘Okay. I’m going to pee, and then I’m going to go do it. Just don’t come in. It would make me self-conscious.’ 

He marveled at the strength of her compulsion to strike any task from her to-do list as quickly as possible. She had an obsessive, prideful self-discipline that he’d always found irritating and attractive. While she peed, he sat at the kitchen island, spinning in circles on his stool, and wondered if he should thank her, or if that would be cloying, like thanking somebody for sex. ‘Break a leg,’ he said, as she opened the bathroom door and crossed the kitchen. She lingered in the bedroom’s door-frame. Neither of them spoke for a little while.

‘I can figure out something else,’ he continued. ‘It’s too shitty, asking you to make a porn. Next time, I won’t be shocked by the pictures on the monitor. I think it’ll be okay.’ 

‘You don’t say “make a porn”,’ she said. ‘It’s “make porn”. I’m going to get it over with. If the video doesn’t do it for you, you have to let me know, and I’ll try again.’

He wondered if she would turn on the overhead light in the bedroom, or go with the reading lamps, for ambience. Would she be cold, when she stripped, and lay on the bed? Their landlord skimped on heat, and it was always colder in there than in the rest of the apartment. Would she be haunted by the things he’d said during the fight? Would she fake it, and worry that, as her husband, he would be able to tell? Was she angry at him, despite her disavowal of anger? If they failed to have a child, she might be angry at him for a long time. They waved goodbye, for some reason, before she slipped into the darkness with her phone and shut the door.

    "text": "A curled index finger pushed his bottom lip between his teeth, his tongue obligingly searching for flared or dead skin to be peeled off and forgotten, neither swallowed nor spat out, torn layers leaving only sores behind. When soaked with rage, who doesn’t raise fists to another? But the boy, he turns on himself, puts knuckles to his mouth and bites the tension. Chewing, leaning forward, lips sliding this way and that, a hand slapped his wrist. He looked up into the face of his legal guardian, dropped his hand, grappling with the urge to return his patched bottom lip back to his mouth. A cartoon on the television in front of him, a badger speaking to an owl, or a mole speaking to a hare, earned a flicker of attention before he started to pick at the separated and spiked bits of skin on the outside of his nails. On days like this, he’d manage to peel a loose strip from the cuticle down to the first finger joint. He’d then soothe the sting by sucking on his thumb, teasing blood out from the cut.

It was another first day in another new house. The walls were stripped, cracks in places where one worried there shouldn’t be, where the boy could imagine broad-leaved fleabane creeping its way in, sea green hands either side to pull through the wound. Below, splintering and decaying pinewood floorboards were covered with fresh, carnation red carpet – a deep colour drawn from soles, with patterns of unknown flowers woven and overlapping, two stems cut off by mental thresholds where kitchen and corridor began, the designs reminding him of the shasta daisies he’d pick and plucked trailing his way home from school. Along with the fissures threading the walls, there was also writing, bending, ineligible scribbles on stone on one side, and on the other, level sentences suggesting the name Rupert would live forever, drawings and dates, incoherent numbers and lines signifying where someone had grown up. How grown was the boy? He decided to wait until the living room was empty before he measured himself against those who had come before.

With no wallpaper to insulate and the cherry plums and common pears lining the avenues still showing no colour, his guardian sent him to bed with two hot water bottles, one with a fluffy fleece and another bare. He put one under each arm and took the stairs two steps at a time, a giant’s stride. As he reached the top of the stairs, the naked water bottle slipped from his elbow and landed headfirst on the floor, its collar bending as its full body flopped over it. The boy picked it up. ‘Sorry,’ he said.

He climbed into bed, bringing his knees up to his chest, leant his chin on top of them and pushed his sore lips back between his teeth. There were no curtains in his room, only patterned window lining. He could hear whisps of air passing through gaps in the closed window, blown through by the cars on the main road. They were going so fast they might rip the window open and pull him out, leave him floating over plane trees and lamp posts, sycamores and electric lines, a single sheet of local news pirouetting with a fallen leaflet, plastic bag and crisp packets. He hugged the water bottles tighter, his shoulder dipping into the mattress and numbing, persisting drops of water moistening his overshirt. ‘Sorry’, he said again. How many things would he let fall, how much weight could he let go?

He was almost asleep, the room liquefying into incoherence and perceptions that, if caught, made him jerk awake. A misstep. Then, a sound. With a steady pulse he slowly opened his eyes, dry, unseeing, one sense sharpened in the absence and weakness of the others. The shriek of an animal. He climbed out of bed and turned the handle of the window, specks of rust coming away with the dry rasping as it opened onto the garden, overgrown with butterfly bush, nettles and common ivy, perennial and inviting, sirens to sting the tongue or sear the skin. He leaned over to push his face as much into the darkness as he could, squinting to see through the gaps in the connected boughs, his hand still grasping the window handle, and then he saw, with every movement it made, the shifting, splitting and sometimes solid colour of an animal, the outline of a fox. But the colour was wrong. And it moved as if there was no fear, only an awareness of itself. A black fox. Its eyes shone like late light reaching him and in them he saw nothing he recognised, nothing to harm him. The fox made its way once spotted, but before it stepped out of sight and through a branched arch, its tail gave off a silver farewell.

The next night he opened his window again, the chilly reach of wind searching for the warmth of his face before blowing, unsatisfied, to bite at his ears. He let go of the window handle and cupped them both, his slanted top teeth sliding over the bottom. His toes and ears were the most sensitive so he wore three sets of socks to bed and a woolly hat he’d found in one of the moving boxes. Like this, he waited for the caterwaul to merge with the chill, but there was no sound he could cling to and take him off to sleep. Waking, he reached for his clock, wary of time and suspicious of his dreams.

And so this became a night-time rite, but he rarely saw the fox, or heard its caterwauling. On the nights he did see it, he wondered what it would be like to stroke its fur, whether it would feel smooth like the feathers he sometimes found in the park that he pulled through his fingers, or be painful to touch, rough like when he was forced to embrace an uncle and their cheeks rubbed against each other. He noticed the fox’s eyes matched the point of its tail, and if he stared into them long enough, without blinking, when he finally closed his eyes tight he could still see them, like miniature full moons withstanding the night sky. Those eyes waited, confused or foreboding, starved or sated by observing. The fox never made a sound as he watched it, but when the cold became unbearable and he closed the window, he’d hear it again, consistent, a call that helped him drift to sleep as he stared at the changing numbers on the digital clock on his chest of drawers. It was eight minutes past eight when he decided he would look for the fox the next day.

In the morning, he sat on the front step and laced his skates, but he couldn’t get the loops to drop to the sides. Maybe years, maybe months ago, older, rough hands, with the nails bitten down so far only a crescent remained, had tried to teach him, looping and pulling tight with two ‘okay’ gestures, the fragile knot secure if left alone, but unravelling at a soft pull. Those hands had gifted him the skates. They were his favourite, his only pair.. Those hands had rubbed the back of his head as he leaned into their legs. But when he looked up, the face was a blur, trapped in circling dust, only the eyes were too dark and small to belong to any man.

He pushed himself up off the porch and began, slowly, to roll his way to the gate. He planned to follow a straight line from his back garden, hoping the sun would follow until he saw the black fox in the light of day. The front door opened behind him. He didn’t look back but steadied himself by putting a hand on the gate. He listened to the voice of his guardian, his eyes locked on the knot of his laces, searching for the nouns he couldn’t speak. A boy too young to lie for the benefit of others. He waited, ears ringing and stomach churning as he swayed his mouth to chew the walls of his cheek. Soon it was over, a suction of teeth, a lock in a door and then he was free to start his adventure.

He pushed off and began skating, a leg leading in one direction and the other countering it. This way he crossed roads and entered avenues, over flattened plastic bottles discarded by kids bored of playing motorcycles, drifting past flats where others played games and ran across balconies, back-kicking doors before sprinting off the starting block or dodging a hand that would dismiss or recruit them. Looking down, he counted the dark circles on the slabs of pavement he passed, so black and bound it was as though one wheel could fall through as he glided over them. Fumes lingered in the air from a parked and smoked Ford Fiesta, only warm the day before but now abandoned and cold. He shuddered at the burned bruises on its surface and its windowless frame. Inside a cat kneaded what remained of its seats. In a park with a zipline, a queue of kids were looking his way and whispering. He was conscious of his skates not being inline, so he carried on, rolling over the gaps in the pavement where grass and privets extended without braking.

A railing began, entangled with boxleaf and butterfly bush, and he slowed, sliding his hand along the vines and weeds as he rolled along until he came to a gap in the metal fence, the bottom bent inwards so you could crawl through into the undergrowth. He thought of the fox. Perhaps this was its home. He took off his skates, pushed them through the gap and then wiggled his way in after, then patted himself down as much as he could, removing every sign of dirt. Skates in hand he walked through branches and catchweed that held to his clothes, careful around thorns and crushing leaves underfoot to hear the sound, then lost the familiar scent he’d been carrying. He turned to see his woolly hat caught on the branch of a tree. He put it back on and felt that comfort again. He was coming upon another fence, and beyond this, a private land, one where broken crates balanced atop each other, nailed together, interspersed with cardboard panels and cuts of wood to form an encasing wall, with straightened wire mesh and young tree branches manipulated to fortify the barriers. Surrounding the outside were tall shoots of unbending wheat grass concealing seedlings that flew in from parks and encroaching streets, blades stretching to centre ornaments of degrading front doors, chipped and covered with rot, putrid, flaking paint, but standing for entrances into squared off patches of dirt. Once on the other side, he would put his skates back on and walk, letting the wheels sink into the bare earth he could tell would be welcoming. But he would never get that far. Walking along in front of him, its tail sweeping up each step it made, was the black fox. He lifted his knuckle to his lip. He didn’t want to startle it by climbing over so he stayed where he was and made a clicking sound. The fox turned toward him. The boy tried to squeeze his hand through the fence and offer it to the fox, but the gaps were too small. The fox stood for a moment longer, then turned its head and walked away. So this is where he lives, the boy thought. He would be patient. He turned and made his way back through the thicket, thorns, shrubs, felled trees and branches. He’d be back tomorrow, but this time with a better offering.

The next time he was ready. He had been pulling apart a square in the fence so it would be wide enough for one hand. As the fox approached, he forced his hand through, leaning his face against up the railing. In his hand were raspberries that he’d brought from home, risking trouble, not knowing that in few months there would be an abundance of them growing between the thorns in his back garden. The fox took a longer look at him this time and turned to walk towards his hand, majestic, its black fur flickering between one hue and another. It was close enough that the boy thought he could smell it, something like cinnamon and sulphur, but as he jolted his arm to emphasise the berries in his palm, it turned and walked away again. The boy watched its tiny feet take care not to disturb the sprouts tasting fresh air for the first time.

 

Every weekend the boy would make the trip. His legal guardian didn’t question him, only assessed the thickness of his skin with folded belt when he came home with dirt or clinging weeds on freshly washed clothes. He and the fox were on talking terms now. Still, it never took the berries from him, or the grapes, or the apple slices. One evening he put the spoon aside and ate with his hand so the soup would linger on his fingers the next day and he could hold them in front of the fox to see if he favoured food from Ghana. But the fox just watched, often curling into a ball, and once even fell asleep. The boy would talk about school and home and friends and food. Some of the friends in his school threw stones at him and opened his sandwiches to reveal nothing but spread. It was just a game but sometimes it hurt. They’d always say ‘see you tomorrow’, so he knew they must have wanted him to come back.

‘Have people thrown stones at you before?’ he asked.

The boy imagined that they had. People were supposed to be scared of foxes. Between the boy and the fox there were no names. Neither one introduced themselves and the boy resisted naming the fox because a name was a path to personality, and personalities changed, he knew. ‘Do you have a dad?’, the boy asked. ‘Mine is buried near a church. I’m not allowed to see him, though. Are you allowed to see your dad?’ Burdens spilled from the boy’s hands, like an illusion they kept cascading, going, leaving him feeling as though he’d soon join the loose leaves twirling and gliding on the wind. This want for weightlessness meant he missed the slight flicker of the fox’s ear as the boy carried on speaking about where he believed you went when you died.

 

Since the boy had started visiting the fox during the day, he’d stopped waiting by the window at night. Instead, he would sleep curled up with his water bottle imagining it was the unknowable fur of the fox. One night, as a waning gibbous came into view, a cry took him out of his sleep. He walked to the window, moving the cotton lining aside and there was the black fox, its eyes reflecting the fragments of light that came from all directions: lamp posts and stars, passing cars and homes with lights that never go out. There was something else there, too. It was waiting. Without thinking, the boy put on his clothes from the day before, tiptoed in his socks down the stairs, pulled on his shoes, tucked his laces into the sides and left through the front door, running around to the back of the house. He stopped, panting in front of the wooden fence, patient. He heard the fox’s claws scrapping up the wood, jumping off onto the pavement about thirty meters from the boy. This was the closest they’d been without something between them, and the fox gave an intimation that this was the distance they should maintain. The fox began to move. The boy followed. The streets were empty, nothing splitting the sky, no cars coasting by, no one to observe or stare at fur and follower. A world uninhabited, paused in the night so these travellers could traverse undisturbed. More than a few times the boy’s eyelids covered fox and path and he stumbled, not falling, but jerking alert, as he had done in bed. Where were they going, he thought, why was he following? He remembered trailing another, the hold secure, the comfort of constriction, life being squeezed from you and returning warmer than before. In the memory the boy had been led down a street lined with yew trees on either side of them daring a closer approach, intruding yellow archangels spreading below them wanting their edges appraised, the boy feeling he could reach out with his free hand, glide it through the leaves and find it unscathed. His little feet had fought fatigue to keep up with those of his father, but soon weakness had tuned to numbness and he was being dragged along by his arm.

As if in a moment of waking, as if halting life, large black gates with spiked tops and flared sides like dark wings came towards the boy and the fox. Or perhaps broke from the ground, or fell from the sky. The fox slipped through a gap. To the boy’s left and right, spear-topped fencing balanced on a concrete wall, leaning into, no, pulled and grasped at by red robin photinia that crept up behind and swam around each individual pole, restraining itself at the gateway like a twisted flame fearing lost light. The boy pulled at one of the gates, crushing blistered paint, as hard as he could, making just enough room for him to slip under the locked chain.

Somehow it was warmer past this point. He felt as though a hand had slipped up into his stomach and dissolved into light. He tried to lift his knuckle to his chin, but his fingers flowered before him, like a hand offering a gift, and he was left looking at his palm, the red fading in, throbbing, pushing against the barrier like the thrusts of a body trying to force its way free. Nothing filled the silence. The fox had stopped farther off in the distance, his fur luminescent, the sky come to life. The boy began walking, elevated, and before long he was standing next to the fox. He looked down at it. He could, if he chose to, kneel and stoke it, recall what it felt like to willingly touch another. He knew this. But instead he tilted his head and acknowledged the fox by tightening a corner of his mouth. The fox was unmoving, eyes ahead, though still seeing the boy. The boy looked at what it saw, and in front of them was an oval stone with words carved into its face. The boy read. Then read again, not understanding. He looked around. Where did he stand? A question short-lived as soon as it rose. He could make out more pieces of arced and carved stone beside him, some rectangular, others shaped like sculptures, all hemming him in, stretching far into the distance, continuing under oaks and beech, many of them ash, many choked by vines. Behind him the same, his path the only thing separating the burials. Beneath his sole stretched unsettled ground, soil he’d seen the fox stride across so majestically it seemed like only humility was holding it back from strolling on two feet.

‘You have tricked me’, he said out loud, but the fox was no longer there, only the stone and creeping vegetation. And so the boy closed his eyes and let himself go.

    "text": "Sidney used to say that life sped through three acts toward the grave.

In the first act, things happen to you. In the second, you think about those things that happened to you. In the third, things happen to you that you’d rather not think about.

I think Sidney is somewhere between acts two and three, but she might be trapped in an encore of the first. I wouldn’t know. I haven’t been able to see the stage for quite a while.

 

I met Sidney through Veronica, who edited my first short story collection. They worked in the same office, and were eating lunch together in a parkette overrun with skateboarders one afternoon when I picked up Veronica’s latest round of edits, which she insisted on giving to me on paper.

I had a small crush on Veronica, but it vanished the instant I saw Sidney struggling with an overstuffed tuna sandwich, her enormous lips caked in mayonnaise, crumbs on her blouse.

‘This is Sidney, she’s a translator,’ Veronica began. Sidney, uninterested in decorum, cut her off,

‘Veronica was telling me about your book. I’ve got a note for you too. If you want a character in a short story to sound important, make them a translator.’

With one comment Sidney told me she was smart, that she didn’t take herself seriously, and that she didn’t give a fuck that she had food on her face.

I’d say that I fell in love with her right then.

 

When Sidney was twenty-nine she moved to Paris with her then-boyfriend, Yuri. I told her I would’ve advised against that, because your thirties are about comparing your current partner to the one from your twenties, the one you’re destined to break up with.

‘Sure,’ she said, ‘but who knows that at twenty-nine?’

They’d been together for four years. Sidney was in love with Yuri, so much so that she had agreed to relocate to Paris for him, despite disliking Paris.

During the third week of her new life on Rue des Batignolles, Sidney had a thought: Paris was full of men, each of them potentially better for her than Yuri.

‘I realized,’ she told me, as we folded laundry in our building’s basement, just days after moving in together, ‘that people move to Paris hoping to find their true love. The move to any new city is always the hope of a new life. Renewal. Not that that’s something I believed in, and I’m not sure I do now either.’

Yuri sometimes skipped bathing for a day, occasionally two. It hadn’t ever bothered Sidney before, not really, but in Paris she saw men on the street who were just as handsome as Yuri, possibly more ambitious, not as attached to their mothers. Maybe these men showered daily, never took a day off the way Yuri did. What had she done? Who moves, she’d realized that morning – in the apartment they were still furnishing – to one of the world’s most notoriously romantic cities with someone they’ve grown, as she put it, accustomed to? She was ‘selling herself short’ she told me. Yuri had done nothing wrong. She assured him of that when she broke up with him, a few weeks later.

I plucked Sidney’s favourite T-shirt from the pile of laundry and began folding it. I’d never met Yuri, but my heart broke for him: young and in love in Paris, building a new life, looking forward to folding laundry with his girlfriend, unaware she was about to become a memory.

I told Sidney that as her current boyfriend, this was a terrifying story to hear. She laughed and called me silly, maybe gave me a kiss, and all I could think was,

‘But, she would’ve acted just this way with Yuri.’

 

Before Sidney, most of my time in the shower was spent adjusting the knobs like a safecracker, rarely able to find the perfect temperature. During the first week in our apartment on Jackson Street, Sidney witnessed this while she sat on the toilet brushing her hair.

‘The water’s fine,’ she laughed, ‘get the fuck in and get wet.’

Sidney, Sidney Sidney.

 

Eventually Sidney and I got married. We moved into a building with in-unit laundry, but we no longer shared stories while folding clothes. Nothing was wrong, we’d just developed our own routines, and were occasionally out of sync.

It’s only with hindsight that I remember Yuri, and Sidney saying she’d grown ‘accustomed’ to him.

Sidney and I rarely fought and could tell each other anything, or so I thought. People say it’s healthy for couples to fight, it means there’s still passion. I’ve always assumed that was bullshit, but now I’m not sure.

Our new dynamic involved us only having sex once a month, sometimes less. I brought it up one night when I was tired and frustrated by my inability to finish writing a story.

‘Obviously, I think you’re beautiful, and fatally sexy,’ I’d told her, truthfully. ‘I just wonder what other women might be like.’

I missed sex with my wife, that was the crucial bit, but after that, I just missed sex. Despite my awareness of Sidney’s beauty and my own glaring sexual and physical mediocrity, I felt restless. I presented the classic pitch of all men selling non-monogamy: I claimed to be helpless, just like an infant, a ten-month-old focused on a purple block who quickly becomes attracted to an orange sphere. I loved the purple block that was Sidney – with her blond hair, long legs and enormous, perfectly symmetrical breasts – but if she wasn’t available, I still needed a shape to play with.

The day of my comment about other women, I’d seen one: a brunette shifting her weight from foot to foot in line at the grocery store. She was wearing tight leather pants. Sidney only wore dresses. She had big dumb curly hair. Sidney’s hair was straight. She could’ve been anything really, so long as she was different from Sidney. At that point we’d been married for eight years, one more than the famed itch, although I’d been itchy for a while. The woman ahead of me in line might employ a sexual technique I’d never experienced, might say or do something so unexpected that it would blow my mind. I put down my basket, ran to the bathroom and masturbated furiously.

I wasn’t being entirely selfish. I was, I told Sidney, also interested in her pleasure. Maybe she’d like to experience something different? I trusted her, I loved her; I wasn’t scared she’d leave.

‘You hurt my feelings,’ she said. ‘I honestly am happy with you. You make me feel great. I don’t notice anyone else.’

I wanted to take it all back. Her lips had kissed mine thousands of times. She never made me feel fat, or bald, and I was both. I didn’t bring it up again.

Two years passed.

 

Sidney and I managed to get back in sync, and I accepted that I couldn’t have everything I wanted. The novelty of unknown naked women never became more important to me than our marriage. Surrendering to that fact may have made me a better husband, although I never thought to confirm this by asking Sidney. We went back to folding laundry together, and it was while I watched Sidney rolling up my socks that she told me the story.

Translation work had dried up, so Sidney was bartending at an art house theater here in Los Angeles. She’d been setting up for a screening slash reception when a woman she described as looking ‘dusty’ walked in.

‘She was in her early thirties,’ Sidney said, ‘and I swear just covered in a thin film of dust, head to toe. She was beautiful in this 1970s way, with blue eyes, sandy blond hair in a ponytail, and freckles on her nose, the kinda freckles you see on cartoons and Playboy bunnies. Hollywood pretty, unreal, like an average dad’s dream centerfold.’

I told her she was also an average dad’s dream centerfold, seeing as I was an average dad. She laughed and we both looked at Penny, our nine-month-old who the day before had been eight months and thirty days.

The dusty woman seemed dazed, stunned. Sidney always tried to help strangers, especially women who seemed vulnerable. She continued.

‘I thought maybe she was a camper who got lost. I asked if she was okay. That seemed to wake her up. She said she came to the theater because that was the last place she was “before.” That was confusing. I asked her before what?’

‘Well,’ the woman told Sidney, ‘I’d just seen a movie, and I wanted a date shake, so I drove to the Date Shack in Westmoreland, near the Algodones dunes.’

Sidney was born here. I’m from Michigan. The date thing runs deep for locals. She explained.

‘I understood her. Date shakes don’t taste the same anywhere else. If you get them from Date Shack or a stand in the valley, the fruit is still warm from the sun, and the vanilla ice cream is really cold. They melt into each other in this amazing way. You can replicate it by leaving dates on your dashboard, but if you want the real thing you have to go to the valley, where the medjool dates grow.’

There’s a particular type of California girl who prioritizes medjool dates and getting to the beach to watch the sunset. They say you walk too fast and they never know what time it is. They love Joni Mitchell but especially Hejira, apparently her most personal album, which some critics were unkind to. They believe that dreamcatchers work, that magic is real, and they’re experts at being in love. Sidney was that type. She tried to hide it the way certain girls from Boston try hiding their accents. She mostly failed, and I loved that she did.

The woman explained that after she got her shake, she saw ‘an unusually handsome man’. He struck up a conversation with her, and she found herself transfixed by his looks, and his charm. He said he had a farm nearby where he grew dates, and invited her to go back with him. Despite how objectively sketchy it all was, she was interested, and found herself walking toward her car with him. That was when the handsome man told her that he had ‘multiple wives’ and suggested that she might want to join his household; a red flag the dusty lady claimed to have purposefully ignored. Once she got to the man’s farm, ‘it was paradise.’ She liked the other wives and decided, basically immediately, to become wife number four. They all wore beautiful handmade clothes and picked fruit together. She didn’t mention her relationship with the man, instead she focused on how much she enjoyed the company of the other wives. Sidney made a point of telling me that the dusty woman ‘didn’t use any special jargon’.

‘Then,’ Sidney told me, ‘she said that “years passed”. She’d woken up and realized she missed her mom. Her credit card had expired and her cell phone didn’t work. Her car was parked there at the farm, but looked like it hadn’t been driven in years. She tried the ignition and it started. There was just enough gas for her to drive back to LA, to the theater. It seemed like she didn’t know she was covered in dust, and I didn’t ask about it. She didn’t mention saying goodbye to the wives, or anything about the man. All I could think to do was offer her a drink. I gave her a glass of whiskey and asked if she’d ever go back. She looked at me strangely, took a long time to answer, then said “I guess not.” Then she laughed; she realized she couldn’t pay for the drink. I said it was on the house. I mean I was worried about her. I went to the stockroom to get napkins. When I came back she was gone. Her car was gone. Nobody had seen her leave. I’d only been away for like thirty seconds.’

Sidney couldn’t stop wondering about the dusty woman, and I sympathized. It was mysterious. Where did she go? Where had she been all those years, and who the fuck was this medjool farming Svengali?

‘Why didn’t she ever talk about the man?’ she’d ask me, ‘Why was it only about how nice it was to be with the other wives?’

This came up a lot. I was curious too, just less vocal. Anyone who loves someone with an obsession inevitably becomes exhausted by how they unceasingly belabor some point or another.

‘Fuck, Sidney,’ I said once, on a day where she’d mentioned it repeatedly, ‘maybe the whole story was bullshit. Maybe there was no guy, maybe the guy was just the least interesting part of what happened there. You need to let it go.’

I’ve tried to forgive myself. It was practically every day for over a year, most people would lose patience.

She stopped discussing it with me soon after that, but she didn’t let it go. And why should she? That I got tired of hearing about it didn’t make it any less interesting to her. And she’d actually talked to dusty, spaced-out wife number four. I couldn’t know what that felt like.

 

For six months, Sidney kept her curiosity to herself, and while I should’ve known it was because she realized it was getting on my nerves, I forgot. She began making the two-hour drive to the Date Shack in Westmoreland every other Sunday, but I wasn’t concerned. She was a California girl who liked the open road and doing what made her happy.

I was a Michigan guy who’d been trying to let his wife have her own private life ever since we began dating. Possessiveness was my default. Suggesting we explore non-monogamy was my most extreme attempt to act against my own nature, and I found it very uncomfortable.

It’s a complicated thing when your less sophisticated character traits are proven to be useful.

Looking back, she must’ve been waiting for him to find her, leaning against her car in the parking lot, sucking the last of a date shake through a plastic straw.

When she didn’t come back that day, as awful it sounds, for a while I hoped she’d crashed the car, far from the road, or that she’d been abducted by aliens.

For the first few months I drove to the valley each Sunday on my own, asking if anyone had seen my wife. Nothing. There was comfort in that, but not much. Later I started to bring Penny with me. Penny, a good luck charm. Penny, with the photograph, asked a trucker with a date shake if he’d ever seen her mama.

He had. I took over the conversation.

‘Brother,’ he said, with more pity than I liked, ‘I saw her, was around eight months ago. She was talking with some man . . . I sure as shit didn’t like him because my girl couldn’t stop saying how handsome he was. Then they both got into a car and headed south toward that mess of medjool farms.’

Penny turns four in three weeks. Sidney’s forty-third birthday was last Wednesday. I pay to keep her cell phone working and renew her credit cards. I tell my friends to keep an eye on their wives. I hope they don’t misunderstand me.

 

Sidney thought that life sped through three acts toward death. That makes sense to me.  But I’ve learned it’s also true that you might be forced to work from an illegible script, that the stage can dissolve. Life is about structure, either one you construct or one that’s forced upon you. Mine has collapsed. All three acts are playing out simultaneously. I wish I could talk to Sidney about it. She understood these things.

    "text": "The compound was set on 300 acres of deciduous wood. There was a creek that babbled. A saltwater swimming pool they called Infinity. A greenhouse full of plants. Red clay tennis courts where you could volley, serve, volley, serve. A wrought iron table where we ate apple galettes. A beach where the flotsam and jetsam might kiss you. There were fish too. Calvados in a Styrofoam cup. There was no town nearby. No local market at which to shop. Instead, grounds, compound, Jacob’s porcelain ladder pointed to the sky. Instead, the tug of crisp cotton on your neck. A ladies’ mule, brown suede. Size 37.

To me this was all a beautiful occurrence. I had not been here for long, but I already viewed this place as my home. It was so peaceful. You could hear a songbird’s song, a bobolink, as if it were right next to your eardrum. Hello, beautiful. It seemed to say. And the eardrum went: badum. I could get used to this, I thought. I could be here for the rest of my life which, at age twenty-seven, stretched out before me. I was here because a yellow bus for education arrived while I was tilling the land, picking corn for my family.

Because I was a zaftig thing with a winsome gaze. Because of the transit of the planet Saturn and the great storm that followed. Because I was in the golden hour of my youth and this was my last chance to prove myself. Because I woke up one morning and my skin was less elastic. When you are a female this is what happens: if you are not selected to be a mate by age twenty-seven, you are asked to get on the bus. You say goodbye to mother and father and the stall boy Rickerts McClure who you regularly take a raping from when his mood strikes. They say Git, Hailey, git, git git, shoo, out of here, please go away forever! And so you listen, not even shedding one tear. And when you get off the bus what happens is you get to sit by the swimming pool. You receive a bedroom at the end of a long hallway and on the walls there is a sunflower motif.

There were other girls at the compound. Women who were just like me. Unmarried, yet with a curious glance. The eyes are milky and also soft. The lips in a perpetual state of shudder. Wizened by the end of their youth – like a fruit sitting out there to rot at the windowsill when it is a humid time. Their necks choked by the uniform of a crisp cotton blouse in a soft creamy white. Their hair pulled back by a stiff ribbon, a baby pink. These were some of their names: Blanka, Antitrust, Zofia, Lurcidlia, Motorollah, Boulder, Thespian, Wisdom, Mystery, Alexia, Bergamot, And In the River Did Life Grow, Trinity, Excelsior, Father.

We spent all of our days together, keenly waiting for our destiny to begin. We knew that we were here for a purpose. That on the compound it was not just us. That on the other side of this big house, were others, guests, and that eventually we would help them. We knew we were lucky to be in this position. It was not considered optimal to remain stag at age twenty-seven and the compound was the superior option. At the compound, you got a shot at a life of beauty. You got a shot at making a difference. You would be given a peony to hold. They would place the egg of one fish on a cracker and place it in your mouth. We knew it had something to do with the appeal of our sex. That our beauty could be of assistance.

We knew we were lucky because we had all heard whispers of what happened if the bus did not arrive. It was a horse, it was a buggy. It was a hand wearing a white glove. It was the pointing of a gun they called Assault Rifle at your left temple. It was the admittance to a tower which had cramped conditions and you made GameBoys for the venerable Božidarka IV.

We practiced all day long. We painted our toenails red. We said thank you when spoken to. We cut our bangs and braided our hair. We went into the kitchenette and focused on the ancient art of mixing drinks. We sat around on a divan and studied a periodical called LadieZdietbible Spring 2003, which provided instruction on how to be a perfect lady. Tuesday: lunch is a turkey burger w/ one slice of avo, dinner is a salmon filet and a green salad with a lemon vinaigrette. Workout: 10 mins of pilates, 100 sit ups. To the commissary we went for the purpose of clothing. A man called Charles D held watch and we would receive a beating if we used an improper tone of voice. Slut! he’d yell when we’d ask for a new pair of brown suede mules, size 37. You have an improper tone of voice! It is time to receive a beating.

We loved it. Charles D was very skilled with his beatings. It reminded me of Rickerts McClure. I thought of his intermittent rapings. I missed his availability. He was always waiting for me, standing by the stables, exhaling in the morning, when it was still cold enough to see his breath. It was terrifying but oh, I did miss him. One minute your hands are picking the family’s corn and the next your face is in the dirt and a bruise blooms black and blue on your thigh and you split open because you did not have the opportunity to get your tight little pussy nice and wet first. When Charles D began to pummel us because of our failure to properly ask for mules, I became quite aroused.

Motorollah especially found Charles D’s behavior to be laugh-out-loud hilarious as well as sexy. She was the one who first had the idea that a great preparation activity would be for us to do intercourse. I’d go into her bedroom, which featured a fern motif on the wall. She’d push my head down and tell me that this is what we’d do when we met the guests on the other side of the big house. It was time to get serious. It was time to be prepared. The action was similar to the movement needed to find an oyster’s pearl. Mother and father would often drop me at the cold salty creek and ask me to wade into the water wearing some galoshes to find an oyster’s pearl. I never received any riches from my searches, but I did learn to enjoy its flavor.

To eat an oyster you crack it open with your dagger and then you consume the meat in one gulp. I did this many times, the blade of my dagger slicing the white of my thumb. The gush of bright red blood would splatter on the water’s surface and then you’d see a mackerel’s eyeball gaze up from below, searching. In your ear you might hear the whisper of the Apostle Paul as he explains to you his suffering. I consumed Motorollah in this way. I am extremely turned on by the way you eat my tight little pussy as if it were an oyster from the cold salty creek, she’d say, I am going to ejaculate, which is something females can do. It is just in a different way. It is essentially piss, but it does not taste very disgusting.

She was my main acquaintance at the compound. We had many conversations about what awaited us on the other side of the house, about the guests, who were shrouded in mystery. I believe on the other side of the house they are in need of our services because they have deformities. But not ones that are difficult to work with. Perhaps he has one arm small, one arm large. Or he is blind, requiring a glass eye. Motorollah was very smart. Before the bus picked her up her mother and father encouraged academic pursuits. She went to high school. She went to sleepaway camp. She knew about the Socratic Method, numbers which are divisible, the names of Cubist painters and a bard called Barry Bonds. She took me outside one night and pointed up to the sky and in her alto voice she told me that the streak of light we could see was a meteorite, a rock born in the cradle of blackness which we call outer space.

And how lovely this occurrence was. A pilot light bursting from the blanket of the whole of the deep big sky. I know of the pilot light because of the gas flame I used to cook meals for mother and father, who detested my soufflés. Motorollah knew of meteorites because she was academically inclined. Because she had been to high school. Because in high school you are given a telescope, a book, a teacher in a lavender smock speaking in a dulcet tone about the tail, the tail that bursts from the void. She would say, this married woman, this teacher, in a dulcet tone: AND THE EARTH WAS WITHOUT FORM, AND VOID; AND DARKNESS [WAS] UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP.

I sighed and gingerly placed my head on Motorollah’s shoulder. Motorollah who was full of knowledge. Motorollah and her days of heaven. Motorollah who identified the song of a bird as belonging to the bobolink. Motorollah, Motorollah, Motorollah. She squeezed my hand when I did this, when I gingerly placed my head on her shoulder. We are going to find our true purpose soon, she said. Please take your head off of my shoulder.

We were to meet the guests at a dinner party. The invitation was conveyed by a parcel. The parcel spoke of a fashion show. There would be a fashion show first. Before the dinner. We’d model the latest styles. A crucial activity for helping the guests is showing off your bosom in some vestments. And yes, mine were great. Quite large, some might say heaving. I’d look fine in any of the outfits they procured for the occasion. Motorollah noticed me smiling as we walked to the atrium. There was a look on her face where it seemed as if this sight was terrible. I do not know why she had a sad expression, given that she was so perfect to me.

To get to the other side of the house: a portal, at the end of a long hallway. A portal, behind a cherry oak door.

It looked like a normal portal, one that all of us were familiar with, this being du jour during the current époque. It sparked in a way similar to lightning. It glowed purple and silent. Using our instincts from similar portals in the past we knew that we all had to hold hands. We had to be a daisy chain. I looked over at Motorollah to see if she wanted to hold my hand. Motorollah did not meet my gaze. I tried to picture her thoughts: NOW THE SERPENT WAS MORE SHREWD THAN ANY OF THE WILD ANIMALS IN GOD’S KINGDOM, MORE SO THAN THE GREAT OYSTER WHICH HAILEY SLICES OPEN WITH HER DAGGER IN THE SALTY CREEK. I believe these to be the thoughts of Motorollah. Therefore, the cold wet hand of Father. Father, who winked at me. I closed my eyes. Like the sucking of the oyster we were shoved inside the mouth of the portal.

On the other side, it was the backstage of a fine theater. A woman standing in a thong and a bright red brassiere. Hello, she said, Welcome to the backstage area. You will be in the fashion show tonight for the guests! The woman standing in a thong and a bright red brassiere pulled out a rack of clothing. Your vestments for the fashion show! The rack of vestments glittered and sparkled. I could not make out any specifics but I was certain that the guests, including those with deformities, would be pleased by our appearances.

We all undressed. The hideous Father tried to make conversation with me. Wednesday, am I right? According to LadieZdietbible Spring 2003, dinner is an English muffin w/ a slice of tomato. You will do one hour of your Yoga For Fitness Program. I did not care for this chatter so I did not respond. You would not catch me thinking of the LadieZdietbible Spring 2003 while getting ready for the fashion show. I was here to be a professional, to prove I was up for the task. I let the woman in the red brassiere and the thong dress me. Very good, she said, taking off my blouse, A nice heaving breast from the zaftig one they call Hailey. When I was dressed I was given a tall glass of pineapple juice. It was nice and it was tart and I drank it quickly.

In the distance, I heard music. It was laden with bass and split my brain in two, flooding it with possibilities. I imagined the guests I would help, perhaps with deformities, as expressed by Motorollah. This guest – perhaps a man age forty-nine – would take me out by the backyard swamp oak and feed me a hearty meal. Then he’d push me into the dirt like Rickerts McClure. I was happy to feel of use. I knew my twenty-seven years of life to be a failure in many regards. Mother and father hated my cooking. They were always abandoning me in salty creeks. The corn I picked after a long day of tilling the land was never harvested in an adroit manner. But now, I felt certain that my future would be bright, that I would do perfectly well.

I caught my appearance in a large standing mirror. The outfit they had dressed me in was a bright pink T-shirt cut off at the midriff that said, in crystal letters number 7 slut. And as for bottoms, a tightly fitted skirt with a belt featuring a silver chain that fastened with a lock and key. I felt extremely poised and ready to strut my stuff on the compound’s catwalk.

One by one we went down the runway. The lights were very bright. The music was loud. The cavernous room was paneled in wood and a red velvet. In an ancient era this would be where kings with fine rapiers would fight to the death for the fairest maiden, with an audience of one thousand. Yet today, as we walked out in single file, with the very bright lights cussing around in my eyeballs, perhaps there were a few dozen who looked upon us. I could not make out their faces.

But I did see the numbers they held up. I wondered if Motorollah was thinking to herself which one was divisible. The main thing I could think about was that the velvet and the wood and the lights were causing me to perspire like a hoss. I could see sweat beads roll off of me and I was concerned this made me look less viable. Additionally, they had dressed me in high heel strappy shoes and I feared I would fall and receive a lashing from Charles D, who was backstage, chomping down on a cigar. It would be an extreme crisis to receive a beating at this time. Somewhere in the crowd I saw the number seven.

Then the music stopped. Stay in place, ladies, said a masculine voice. It is me, the owner of the compound! I stayed in place. I was feeling starstruck because of the presence of celebrity. Good evening everyone, he continued, and welcome to Poly5ecure. Congratulations for taking the first big step in improving your marriage, which is finding a single girl who is happy to join your marriage. I’d like to now raise a toast to propagating the species as well as true love. Then the very bright lights were turned down and I was able to clearly make out the crowd for the first time. There was a long white table in the room with the velvet and the wood paneling. Seated at the long white table with candles and champagne were twelve married couples. I could tell they were married because they were holding hands and had the expression of true love.

Alan and Stacy were the ones holding the number seven sign, so I was instructed to walk off the stage and make polite conversation with them. If I were to guess, I’d say they were about ten years my senior. Alan had hair only on the sides of his head, in the shape of a horseshoe, and had a stomach which belonged to a pregnant woman. Stacy had yellow hair, which I could tell was not her natural color. She looked very exhausted and there was lipstick all over her face, including her brow bone. She had a glassy stare.

It is great to be in touch, said Alan, we are so glad we did this.

Stacy smiled and sniffed my hand.

You are very beautiful, she said. We found out about Poly5ecure on a web site. This was a very good web site with helpful tips. We already have many activities planned for us all to do. You are going to help us spice up married life big time, I can already tell.

Hold on Stacy, said Alan, I’m playing on my GameBoy.

I watched as Alan played with his GameBoy.

Sorry about that! I was playing a game on my GameBoy. Such a zaftig thing! Said Alan, winking at me. I will grab your heaving bosom now, to make sure I like the way it feels.

Alan grabbed my bosom with his hands then stuck his face between my breasts, making the noise of a motorboat, coasting across the seas. Awooogah! said Alan. She will do just fine, Stacy, I am very glad you found Girl 7 on that web site. Let’s take her to our room for some dessert wine. Girl 7 you can even hold my GameBoy! I was happy to hear they were pleased. Dessert wine was a delicious drink which I was looking forward to and getting to hold the GameBoy is considered a high honor. I wondered if Motorollah saw the part where Alan did the motorboat across my breasts. She was on the other side of the table with a facial expression which seemed evil and sour. Her couple that she now sat with were beautiful. They were the most beautiful couple in the whole room.

Where the guests stayed was very similar to where we lived, except the hallway was wider and inside of the bedroom there was a bed for two instead of one. There was also a small cot at the foot of the bed. On the desk, a framed photograph of a dog. I see you noticed our framed photograph of a dog, said Alan. That is our dog, who belongs to us. You will not be able to meet him because he is back at home with his dog walker, Susan R. She is married.

I mustered a convivial tone of voice and told Alan that this was a nice dog indeed. This is a nice dog indeed, I said. Dogs brought a lot of joy, especially to children. We did not have these on the farm where I tilled the land, but I did not disclose this fact. One thing we had practiced, me and the girls, was the art of mystery. This meant not revealing a lady’s past.

Alan poured me a glass of dessert wine and told me to take a seat on my cot. The flavor was very strong, and quite sweet. Everyone was silent, save for the sipping of the dessert wine. I decided to break the silence. The wine is extremely delicious, sweet but not disgusting, I said. Alan nodded, then whispered something in the ear of Stacy. He got up and took my glass of dessert wine and put it on the desk, next to the framed photograph of the dog. Girl 7, he said, you are hot as fuck. You have huge tits and soft features. I’m hard as a jack knife right now watching you sip that delicious dessert wine. I want you to eat my wife’s pussy.

I did not have time to tell Alan that he was welcome to call me Hailey and suggest that perhaps a few more pleasantries could occur before the lovemaking, perhaps a lesson to be learned about how the meteorite is a rock born in the cradle of blackness, because as soon as I opened my mouth Stacy was right there, pushing her pussy in my face.

Stacy and Alan were my new best friends. We shared many fun adventures together. Jello with whipped cream for breakfast, tennis on the red clay tennis courts. I had to do intercourse with the happy couple three times a day, which was a feat of strength, but I could tell I was doing what I was supposed to do. I was happier than ever. The results were clear. When I walked into the bathroom there were cuts all over my body. When you do intercourse, this is what happens. You receive cuts all over your body. This was the best option for girls at age twenty-seven if they could not find a husband. I was often complimented for my quick work. Feels fucking rad! Stacy would say, Ugh, so glad we went on that web site for couples in sexless marriages. Alan was equally content. My two bad motherfucking bitches, he’d say. Kiss each other while I touch my cock

I did not see the other girls much anymore. We’d all be at the dining table in the room with the wood paneling and red velvet, but we were advised not to speak to each other so we could focus on our couples instead. I’d see Motorollah from the corner of my eye, and the expression on her face was often sullen. I hoped everything was going well over there. One time we made eye contact and her gaze was like a bucket and inside the bucket was the planet of Neptune – a dolorous and lonely place that I knew to be cold. This was the moment where I decided we needed to be reunited. I needed to say something.

It was while swimming in the pool they called Infinity that I decided to be so bold. I had been doing such a good job that day, massaging tanning oil into Stacy’s back, allowing Alan to eat a piece of bluefin tuna off of each of my breasts. So fucking juicy and huge, he’d said of my breasts. I’m going to blast you with my cum now. We were making such a happy memory together. Presently, Stacy was lying out on a pool float which was in the shape of a koala and Alan was practicing his cannonballs, yelling Cannonball! each time he jumped in. I got out of the water and went to the bar and brought everyone a drink with pineapples and cream and a dark brown rum.

Delicious drink! said Alan This is going to make doing a cannonball even more awesome.

I concur, Stacy told Alan. Then she turned to me and said please let us know if you have any questions at this time.

This was my chance.

I was going to be so bold.

And shake things up.

I would like to ask a question, I said. Here is my question. I am wondering if I could play with my friend Motorollah sometime. She is one of the other girls here to help couples with their sexless marriages. One of her traits is that she is academically inclined. It may be nice for our love making if I sometimes may play with my friend. She could accompany me to the greenhouse and we could braid each other’s hair. She has a tight fucking pussy that Alan you may fuck with your cock.

Stacy and Alan looked at me.

And then I looked at them.

I had done something very wrong.

Alan walked over to me, smiled, then pushed me into the pool, holding my head under so I could not breathe. Everything became very dark and in my brain there was only a thin white band of light. When I regained consciousness, Alan slapped me in the face and then I was told to chop firewood with Charles D and think about what I had said.

 

–

 

When you are instructed to chop firewood you do not really chop firewood, you are chased by Charles D with an axe. You are made to run across the grounds. And how expansive they are. How quickly these grounds become your entire universe. How quickly you forget the vast pastures that you once tilled for your mother and father. How back then, so long ago, a rusty pail full of water so pure, so cold. How back then, the backdrop was mountains. So many of them. One million feet high and three hundred million wide. A flake of snow and it would land on your eyelid. When you imagined the future it was murky but always perfect.

But how quickly it all happened. The twist of the ankle. The trip. The fall. The dirt in the mouth. The blood in the soil. The shadow of Charles D. And his voice which says, You cannot disappoint your couple. And then you say, I am sorry for being so pathetic. And his response: Keep running.

I ducked into the woods. I needed to catch my breath. I wanted to do a good job for Stacy and Alan so I just needed to catch my breath. If I caught my breath I would be ready to be convivial and apologize for bringing up Motorollah when the focus was supposed to be on my couple and improvements in their marriage. If I caught my breath I could climb on top of Stacy and put my fingers inside of her vagina while Alan took her breast as if for milk.

The woods were extremely quiet, save for the rustle of leaves and the song of birds. And how the song delighted. I was a fan of birds. For example, the bobolink. I enjoyed seeing them from the treetops. I enjoyed the way they made wind from their wings. I decided to take a seat. I needed to rest my legs. The earth below me was rough. Pine needles quickly found their way into my panties. A colony of ants appeared and what they did was crawl all over the cuts on my legs I had sustained from my lovemaking. I looked up at the sky and the sky was blue mixed with white clouds called Cirrus. I thought of happiness. Motorollah with her hair done up in a chignon. Motorollah lying in the bathtub. A mole between her breasts. A freckle right in between her brows. Motorollah with her legs in the air. Motorollah shivering because of the eating of the oyster and by this I mean her cunt. Motorollah’s ass on my thigh and my hand on her ass. Motorollah skipping rope. Motorollah running through the fields, clutching her skirts. Motorollah holding an Assault Rifle, shooting it at a bobolink. And then: a screech. A sigh. A static noise that grew louder and louder.

There are no second chances when you disappoint your couple. The noise gets so loud that you experience blood from your ears. The noise gets so loud that you do not even register that it is Charles D behind you with a washcloth and he puts it over your face and the smell is strong, very strong, the smell is a similar smell to what would happen if you go to the creek and there are chemicals in the water. This was my last memory before I woke up. In my dreams it was quiet. It was the color of a pitted tangerine.

Twenty-seven is a beautiful age because you have the wisdom yet you are still young, this is a voice that I hear when I wake up. It is a white room with white walls. The hum of a machine that reads out facts about my figure. The pressure of my blood. The weight of my skin. A wise age because life has been lived, for you of course much of life occurred in the land that you once tilled. The voice. Coming into focus now, yes. A female form, similar to my own, but older. A mint green lab coat. A pair of safety spectacles that enlarge the eyeballs. Large teeth, spread apart. I remember the age twenty-seven, I was wise yet still young. But unlike you I was blessed because there was a husband and a babe and a house of wood and there was a life! I searched for some words but I could not find them. A husband and a babe and a life. I suppose I would not have this.

You cannot speak, said the woman, because there are no second chances and you have failed your couple.

The woman got up and retrieved a form and put it on my lap.

And when you fail your couple, you consent to us scrapping you for parts.

The woman pointed to a line on the form that read: If I fail my couple I may be scrapped for parts.

Because someone else out there, who perhaps has a deformity but is still young might have a chance at finding a purpose.

The woman pointed at another line on the form: Given that you are to be scrapped for parts, Poly5ecure is pleased to grant you one wish. Please think very carefully about your one wish.

 

–

 

For my one wish, a husband and a babe and a life. This is what every girl dreams of. The woman tells me this is a good wish. She gathered a husband and a babe and a life together for me with a quickness I had never experienced. In my life before I came to the compound things were slower. You did not say I would like a husband a babe and a life and they appeared. Instead, before: the tilled land moving through my outstretched palm. The cold of the water of the salty creek of the home of the oyster of the home of the mackerel of the girl named Hailey. And now, after: things had to move with a quickness because the thing is they were doing this while I was being scrapped for parts.

My husband and my babe and my life. It was all so perfect. This is what every girl dreams of. My husband and my babe and my life. We lived in a cabin on the slope of a mountain and it snowed and my husband smiled and held my hand when the woman, who hovered behind me, clipped locks of my hair and took a teaspoon and dug into my face, taking my right eyeball and gently pulling it from its socket. We lived in a cabin on the slope of a mountain and I made everyone an apple galette and my husband kissed my cheek when I fed him a slice and the woman in the lab coat who hovered behind me agreed that this was a delight and that she would be happy to give me something for the pain because harvesting the tibia of a twenty-seven year old female is no joke and it was so pleasant when she injected me with the something for the pain that I could feel myself almost melting.

A husband and a babe and a life. This is what every girl dreams of. The babe on my lap. The babe on the swing. My husband laying me out on the bed and making love to my form without violence. My husband taking me on a beach vacation. My husband telling me I look lovely in my dress. My husband telling me even without my right eyeball I have perfectly symmetrical features. My husband walking off the sound stage in the basement of the Poly5ecure compound. My babe crawling off the sound stage of the Poly5ecure compound. The woman in the lab coat taking the babe and putting it at her breast. My husband my husband my husband.

Why did he have to go?

 

–

 

In my final moments, the cool breeze from the window, a bowl of plain yogurt. This is what every girl dreams of. The woman informed me – babe still at her breast – that they would be taking out my heart, and that once this happened, it would be quiet forever. It was such a shame, she told me. It is so easy to be compliant. Then they placed the washcloth over my face. I think I saw, flying out of the void, a meteorite.

    "text": "‘Something happened,’ she says.

‘Something happened?’

‘Uh huh.’

Tommy admires his girl, bow tie loosened and white button-down stained with signature sauce, red as arterial blood. She’s been waiting tables at the Italian chain between the nail salon and the headshop. Tonight she told him to meet her just off the interstate but wouldn’t say why over the phone. She smells like a garlic knot.

‘Something bad.’

‘Alright, out with it.’

‘It’s very bad, Tommy.’

‘Whatever it is, we’ll handle it.’

Tommy lifts his sleeve as a reminder that her name is stenciled across his bicep in a gothic script. Not her name – Nina – but the words ‘her name’, the result of a drunken miscommunication. Nina loves the tattoo nonetheless.

They walk to where her car is parked on the road’s shoulder. This part of the interstate is dark, flanked by woods. The occasional semi truck illuminates light-sensitive signs for rest stops. On his trek here from town, Tommy counted twenty-eight deer.

She stares at the trunk.

‘Don’t freak out.’

‘Did you hit a deer?’

‘Promise you won’t freak out.’

‘I promise.’

‘Pinky promise.’

They lock hands. She lifts the trunk. Tommy’s pupils swallow his irises, a little island absorbing a little sea.

‘Oh, fucking Christ!’

‘You promised!’

‘Is he dead?’

‘I don’t know.’

‘Why’d you put your jacket over him?’

‘I don’t know!’

‘How’d you even get him in there?’

‘I lifted him.’

‘Like hell.’

‘I carry dishes all day, you know. Builds upper body strength.’

Tommy closes the trunk and puts his head in his hands.

‘Did anyone see you?’

‘No,’ says Nina. She describes the scene. Her routine commute home from the restaurant, the figure careening into her headlights. How she’d called out for help but was in that dead stretch of nature where no one walks or jogs or hitchhikes for there is no sidewalk on which to walk or jog or hitchhike. No one really walks or jogs at this hour anyhow.

‘Am I going to hell?’ she asks.

‘No. Whoever gave you a license might be.’

She starts to cry.

‘I didn’t mean to hurt anybody.’

Tommy puts his arm around her. The cicadas are in concert with the oil refinery tonight.

‘Maybe,’ says Tommy, ‘maybe he was a really bad guy, you know? With a penchant for violence. Against women and children. Sick, unspeakable stuff. And maybe he was crossing the road to go do violence to women and children when you came along and –’ Tommy smacks his hands together. ‘So you actually did a public service.’

‘Maybe,’ she says feebly, ‘or maybe he’s a private equity manager named Nelson Lang.’

‘That’s specific.’

Nina rummages in her pocket and produces a faded brown wallet. From it she pulls an ID and a business card:

nelson lang
private equity management

‘Well, you can work in private equity and have a penchant for violence. The two aren’t mutually exclusive.’

‘We should go to the police.’

‘Let’s think about that for a second.’

‘It was an accident.’

‘I just don’t think that’ll hold up in court.’

‘This is traumatic for me, too. How do you think I feel?’

‘How do you think the iceberg felt after the Titanic?’

‘That analogy doesn’t really –’

‘All I mean is that jail is not an environment in which I see you thriving.’

She’s crying again and he’s comforting her, then kissing her. Adrenalin a short pipeline to arousal. The wind sounds like a buzzsaw.

From the trunk, there comes a faint knocking. Timid, like an apprehensive solicitor.

 

The phrase lost her father seems off to Jo-Anna because she knows exactly where he is. He is at the Elmwood Cemetery and, before that, he was in his recliner, hooked up to a bevy of chirping medical appliances. Her father was her best friend. She’d come over after her secretarial job each evening to chat, and when he could no longer chat, to watch an hour of his favorite program in which a prominent scientist and a prominent religious figure are put into dire survival scenarios. ‘Jiggly Jo,’ her father would say, ‘my little lump.’ And she’d change this or that tube, descending from his nose like stalactites. Her evenings have become so expansive since his passing. She sits behind the front desk nibbling her vending machine snack du jour until the sun sets beyond the hills, then waits for the evening bus home.

She likes being alone. She spent her teens alone, mostly. The kids used to joke that Jo-Anna was the last in their high school to keep her hyphen intact. She’d once heard that your time spent alone is pivotal, preparing you for the times when you are not. The times when you are a partner or a parent. Once, at the office’s non-denominational holiday celebration, an intoxicated senior manager kissed her on the mouth. It was more of a collision than a kiss, teeth knocking awkwardly while his wife visited the buffet. He also grabbed her ass and said, ‘there’s enough of you to go around, huh?’ Though she understands that the prevailing conditions of twenty-first century America allow for her to object to this, she doesn’t.

Jo-Anna lives in a basement apartment, and when people walk above, drywall sprinkles down on her. She took three days of bereavement after her father passed. When she returns to the office it is as though nothing has happened at all.

One of the managers, a quiet man who keeps to himself, a man who does not attend the non-denominational holiday parties, the company barbeques, blood drives, charity marathons or comedy nights, approaches her desk.

‘I was sorry to hear about your father,’ says Nelson.

‘In the past tense?’

She is thorough in a way that is off putting to people. It makes for a good secretary, not a good conversationalist. But Nelson smiles.

‘I am sorry. Were you close?’

‘He was my best friend.’

‘My condolences,’ he says and returns to his office.

Jo-Anna watches him after that. She watches Nelson conduct his business respectfully. He is honest with his clients and helps them make safe, responsible investments. He is cordial but doesn’t linger in office socializing. His desk does not sport a single personal touch; no bobbleheads or family photos, no books, candles or mugs. He does not wear headphones but once during a shared elevator ride she caught him nodding along to the muzak pumped in by the building. He is a man of few words and few earthly pleasures and for this Jo-Anna loves him.

She loves him more each day. While Nelson is polite to Jo-Anna she sees other members of the office get together. Share lunch hours. She overhears plans being made to meet at the local pub after work. No one asks her to meet at the local pub after work. She takes a specialized business class online and applies to an open CPA position at the company. Another girl, a junior accountant, is chosen for the job. The office throws her a little party in the break room with a cake and a bubbling drink that resembles champagne but does not contain alcohol. Jo-Anna pilfers the remainder of the cake from the refrigerator, takes it home with her and eats it in her father’s recliner which she has moved into her apartment. She does not mean to eat the whole thing. ‘Little lump,’ she thinks.

 

One day it rains heavily and the gutters overflow. People run from the office to their cars holding newspapers over their heads. Jo-Anna sits at her bus stop and shivers. She has heard that chickens can drown in the rain simply by looking up. A car pulls over and Nelson lowers the passenger window.

‘Can I give you a lift home?’

‘I wouldn’t want to put you out.’

‘It’s no trouble.’

In the warmth of Nelson’s car, Jo-Anna is unable to speak, cannot will the function, as though her mouth were a wound that has long since healed. So they’re quiet save for a few left here’s and right at the lights which stretch the limits of her communication. The rain is violent, on the windshield like a machine-gun spit. Nelson’s car is as austere as his desk. No hula girls, no fuzzy dice.

‘Are you close with your father,’ she finds herself saying, apropos of nothing, barely intelligible in the storm.

‘Never knew him,’ says Nelson.

‘That’s a shame,’ says Jo-Anna.

‘Do you like being a secretary?’ asks Nelson.

‘Yes,’ says Jo-Anna, ‘but my real interest lies in bookkeeping.’

‘Then that is what you should pursue.’

She shakes her head.

‘Why not?’

‘They didn’t give me the accountant position.’

‘It’s their loss,’ says Nelson. ‘Pearls before swine.’

Jo-Anna smiles. She was right about Nelson. He’s quick and, despite their different castes in the corporate structure, he’s kind. He’s a little off but so is she. And there’s a moment there in the rain that feels as though something might happen between them, the sustained eye contact, their breath mingling in the confined space. Maybe she doesn’t have to be alone. And maybe she’s ready to open her life to another. He could come in for some tea, and they could get to talking, really talking, the kind of conversation that bonds people in an enduring way, that mends two fissured souls, and with their souls mended she’d ask him to spend the night on the couch because it’s really coming down out there and he’d decline and she’d insist and he’d relent and they’d talk further and he’d admit that, in fact, he has had a thing for Jo-Anna all these years and she would reveal that his feelings are reciprocated and they’d laugh and he’d say well how about that and this is the story they’d tell the next generation of Jo-Annas and Nelsons, the story of two pearls in a private equity firm. And she’s about to offer to do Nelson’s taxes when the car comes to a gentle halt before her apartment and Nelson looks at her, patiently but expectantly, to exit the vehicle. She thanks him for the ride and goes inside, where she’s dusted with ceiling as she weeps atop her mattress.

 

Two police officers relax on the sofa. Their wives tidy the kitchen. A roast has been picked to the bone. A wine decanted. Their time serving on the same force now feels like a lifetime ago now. The younger sergeant gesticulates wildly as he speaks to the older lieutenant.

‘And you’d usually survive that sorta thing but because of the nature of the injury, the way the fork went in, it hit some artery or other and, well, that’s all she wrote.’

He articulates blood spray by balling and quickly opening his hand.

‘What a way to go,’ says the lieutenant. ‘I don’t even have cuffs on me. They give us tactical zip ties.’

‘It’s been non-stop lately.’

‘Have you ever been cuffed with a tactical zip tie? It’s un-fucking-pleasant.’

‘Just yesterday we get a domestic disturbance call. This couple living up on the twenty-eighth floor and the girl takes the quicker way down. Guy swears she jumps.’

‘They never jump.’

‘Nosiree Bob.’

‘I have two rules for interrogating,’ says the lieutenant. ‘One: never give out all the information.’

A pause.

The sergeant snorts.

The lieutenant feels the distinct prick of jealousy. He too was once full of pluck and guile, a fire raging inside, but he grew older, slower, more sentimental, and has been sent out to pasture. Now, he rarely gives more than a parking ticket. His own internal fire couldn’t light a tea candle. He has taken to compiling his accounts from the force into a memoir, a draft of which he shows to the younger sergeant who squints at the print.

‘Hoo-wee, you got some four-dollar words in here.’

‘Do you think the fire motif is too heavy handed?’

‘No, no, but hey, any time you want to come back, stop writing and start living,’ says the sergeant, ‘there’s a squad car with your name on it.’

‘I don’t know about that.’

‘It’s a figure of speech, it wouldn’t really have your name –’

‘I like the pace out here.’

The lieutenant does not, in fact, like the pace out here. It’s the pace of a lazy river. He’s antsy. His wife feels it too, this cabin fever. She keeps having bake sales for increasingly rare diseases and spending the money on esoteric exercise classes. His wife knows more about the martial arts than him, could likely defeat him in combat. These days, who couldn’t?

The lieutenant offers the sergeant another drink. It’s declined. The sergeant has that long drive home. But it’s been good catching up, they should do it again soon. The wives so enjoy it, we do it all for them, etc. etc. Is there pity in the sergeant’s parting glance?

The lieutenant takes his drink to the porch. His career’s bathetic conclusion has made it difficult to end the memoir. He is grateful to never have been seriously injured while serving but, when it comes to the culmination of his duties, he’d have preferred a bang to a whimper. That night he lies awake in bed scrounging for an ending. His wife fights in her sleep.

This restlessness continues into the next day which the lieutenant spends on aimless patrol. He never knows how to orient himself in the town for optimal idling. He does not want to sit too near the park for fear of interacting with the local youth or faith-based groups. Nor in front of local businesses. Policemen have fallen from public favor since his day and his presence discourages customers. So he drives on, until roused from his stupor by a burst of static.

‘You read?’ says the radio.

‘10-2.’

He pulls over, throws on his park-anywhere lights.

His wife texts asking what he’d like for dinner.

‘Uh,’ says the radio. ‘Something happened.’

The lieutenant straightens. Kills the air conditioning. Leans in close to await further detail. His wife texts that she’s making a puttanesca.

‘I think you’d better get over here,’ says the radio.

 

The lieutenant drives to the provided address, a little house secluded in the woods. His heart is making a valiant effort against his breastplate. Hands jittery, he fiddles with the stubborn parking brake. A trooper is waiting outside the house. The curtains are drawn.

‘Hikers heard noises,’ says the trooper, ‘so I, well, go and see for yourself.’

The lieutenant approaches the front door into which the trooper has already broken. He feels for the release tab on his holster. It’s quiet. No birds. Even the insects are holding their breath. The house is furnished minimally, a little musty, and pierced with beams of afternoon light. There is no art, no charm, no personal touches, no signs of life. Papers are stacked and organized neatly on a desk. The lieutenant follows the muddied footprints of the trooper deeper into the property. The hallway is dark and he removes his sunglasses to let his eyes adjust before proceeding. His eyes are wet and gentle, but some fire in them yet. He stops before a little door beneath the stairs. Hand at his side. Whole body clenched. He pulls it open with the innate logic that something painful should be done quickly, and lets forth an inaudible gasp.

‘There are real sick people out there,’ says the trooper.

Behind the little door; the ending to his memoir. A bestseller.

 

Nelson wakes with a very bad head injury. He shrugs off what seems to be a women’s jacket and assesses his surroundings. A hatchback. Bleary, he can make out bickering voices from beyond the trunk’s confines. A male and a female. Now this one’s a puzzler. Think, Nelson. What happened that day? He’s in his church attire, all soiled and bloodied, which means it is Sunday which means, after church, Nelson would have been doing his special activity. Beyond that, he draws a blank. He contorts himself to pat his pocket where his keys remain but his wallet has vanished. He’s parched. The sensation of crying sets in but no tears fall. Like a newborn. Another flash of memory comes. The rotating lights and beacons, red and blue. When he returned from church that afternoon, police were casing his house. They must have discovered his special activity. That’s right. He’d retreated into the woods to avoid conflict. We must avoid conflict at all costs, his mother refrained. He’d waited until nightfall, traipsing down footpaths and over root systems into the anonymity of the wilderness. Tired and dehydrated. He finally thought he’d try his luck with civilization, if only for some water, and made his way back to the road, staggered out of the tree cover and into the splintering headlights.

He knocks weakly from within the trunk. The voices stop abruptly. After a moment, it opens.

‘He’s alive,’ says the male.

‘Thank God,’ says the female.

‘If he’s alive, he can sue,’ says the male through clenched teeth.

Still gnarled, supine in the trunk bed, Nelson displays calmness by touching opposite fingertips together, something he does when working with finicky clients.

‘Could I have my wallet,’ says Nelson.

‘I am so sorry,’ says the female. ‘Jesus.’

‘Really sorry, man,’ says the male.

‘The roads are so dark out here,’ says the female.

‘Really dark,’ says the male.

‘No harm done,’ says Nelson. ‘I’ll just be on my way now.’

The male and the female look at one another.

‘I won’t mention the events of this evening to anyone,’ Nelson assures.

‘Really?’ says the male.

‘Really,’ says Nelson.

‘Pinky promise?’ says the female.

Nelson and the female join hands, an NDA of the flesh, and he heaves himself from the trunk. Pain shoots down his spine. The female hands Nelson his wallet.

‘You sure you don’t want my insurance or anything?’ says the female.

The male elbows her.

‘That won’t be necessary,’ says Nelson.

‘Or like, medical attention?’ says the female.

‘Nina,’ says the male. ‘He says he’s good.’

The couple hop into the car and speed away. Without the headlights the darkness is abrasive. Nelson feels his way to the roadside and hobbles towards town. The pilgrimage is grueling and one by one his wounds reveal themselves. Rather than a comprehensive pain, isolated areas of injury pulse and throb. He bolsters himself on telephone poles. Town is unwelcoming at this hour. Even the local pub is long closed. Hope wanes with strength. There’s comfort in giving up. Then, a familiar side street. He limps past a row of squat brick apartment buildings, and uses his last reserve of energy to knock on the door of a basement unit. It takes a few moments for its resident to rouse and answer.

‘Nelson?’ says Jo-Anna. ‘What’s happened to you?’

 

Inside, Jo-Anna tends his wounds. She’s quiet and makes quick work of them, dabbing and wrapping and clicking her tongue in disapproval. Nelson cannot get enough water. He lets it run down his cheeks.

‘And they just left you for dead?’ she repeats.

‘There are sick people out there,’ Nelson tells her.

‘Shouldn’t we go to the police? The hospital?’

‘I think I just need to get some rest.’

‘I can’t possibly let you go home like this.’

He puts up the formality of protest but eventually, graciously, accepts her offer to stay over. It is late, he is hurt, etc. etc. His host seems truly elated by his compliance, every emotion broadcast across her plump face. For a moment, he imagines performing his special activity on her. Instead he showers in her small bathroom and collapses into her bed. As she fusses with the covers, he notices her hands shaking.

‘Won’t you lay down with me for a minute?’ he asks her.

Nelson fears he’s offended the secretary when she starts to cry.

‘I’m sorry,’ he says.

‘No,’ she says, ‘I would like that very, very much.’

    "text": "Imet Dawei and Zichen on the same day, an hour apart. Dawei and I were both late for a bookshop panel, and arrived to find no seats left. We stood at the back and listened for a while, then one after the other we headed to the coffee shop downstairs. Dawei sat at the table next to mine, still holding the book that the event was for: Roberto Bolaño’s Last Evenings on Earth. We both ordered Americanos. He started talking to me in a not particularly enthusiastic tone, wondering which story from the book was my favourite. ‘Anne Moore’s Life’, I said. You girls all like that one, he said. What about you? I asked. His favourite was ‘Mauricio (“The Eye”) Silva’. Right away I thought he might be gay, because I had a gay friend who also liked that story. He was dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans, which didn’t tell me anything. We chatted for a bit about 2666, then he said the panel would be ending soon, and suggested we go somewhere else before the audience came down and the place got crowded. Outside we saw someone else holding a copy of Last Evenings on Earth. This was Zichen. He’d gone to the loo halfway through the event and, while peeing, realised that none of the speakers understood Bolaño any better than he did, so he went back for his bag and left. Now he was standing beneath a clove tree having a cigarette. It was spring, and there’d just been a rain shower. Zichen told us this reminded him of a Bolaño simile: the quadrangular sky looked like the grimace of a robot. Neither of us could remember which book this was from, so we didn’t respond. Dawei had a smoke too, then we asked Zichen if he wanted to hang out with us.

We ended up in a cafe with numerous three-blade fans hanging from the ceiling. After talking more about Bolaño, we parted ways and headed home to bed. In the months that followed we spent many afternoons at that cafe. By summer, we’d decided to start an independent literary journal called Whale. It was Dawei who came up with the name. He insisted that a journal was alive, and so should be named after a living creature. There’d be one issue every three months, which would include short stories and poems, plus a few photographs. Dawei provided the money for paying contributors and printing. His dad had given him a flat in the city centre which brought in a spectacular amount of rent each month. He refused to work at his dad’s firm, though – in his words, it was a rubbish dump of capitalism. ‘Rubbish’ was his favourite term for everything he hated. The world was just one rubbish dump after another. It was 2012. Dawei was twenty-nine, I was thirty and Zichen thirty-two. Not exactly young any more. By the time they were our age, Nick had witnessed Gatsby’s downfall, and Frank had lost April in Revolutionary Road. It was time for us to stop dreaming, but meeting each other seemed only to delay our awakening. In a way, Whale was a shelter for our remaining dreams. I serialised a novel about a young woman and her lover, the ghost of a sailor from Joseph Conrad’s era. Dawei mostly wrote poems. He had been influenced by Conrad too, who believed that even fiction writers needed to go through the baptism of poetry in their youth. As for the actual poems, it was hard to say whose influence was at work in them, though there were traces of Celan, Trakl and Dickinson. His poems were nebulous, full of bizarre images: a polar bear’s kiss, a seal’s toes, Qu Yuan’s pillow. He illustrated them himself. Zichen barely contributed any writing apart from the foreword to every issue; his main duty was soliciting manuscripts. We knew he was working on a novel, but he refused to show it to anyone. His writing was, as he put it, in the midst of a violent transformation.

Whale shut down after a year due to a lack of material; there weren’t many writers we actually found worthy of publishing. More pragmatically, sales were terrible. We left copies at small bookshops on consignment, but barely any of them sold. The returns soon piled up in our warehouse. One evening we shoved them all against the walls to clear some space in the centre of the room, where we sat and held a simple ceremony to dissolve the magazine. We all got very drunk, hugging and kissing each other. When Dawei kissed me, I thought of the polar bear in his poem. There was a purity to it, no lust at all. If I were to fall in love with either of these men it would destroy quite a few things, and our dream would crumble in an instant – an awful prospect. That’s what was on my mind as I stumbled outside to the loo, a red-brick outhouse. When I was done, I heard flowing water nearby and walked towards it. I found myself at a river. The sailor’s ghost was standing on the water. I came up with an ending for my novel, I said, but I have no reason to finish writing it now. It ought to sink along with Whale, don’t you think? The ghost neither agreed nor disagreed. He held up a hand, as if to see whether moonlight could pass through his palm. I went back to the warehouse and stood before the door, thinking about how my laptop had died earlier that day, which meant I’d lost the first half of my novel. If I were to light a fire and burn down the warehouse, every remaining word of my novel would vanish from this world. The sailor, having followed me back, whispered in my ear, If you do that, I’ll become the ghost of a ghost! I ignored him, and imagined flames devouring the building with my two friends still inside. I’d be lonely without them, but also free. I pushed open the door. Zichen was cradling Dawei’s head, rocking him to sleep, but when he saw me he shook him awake. Dawei sat up unsteadily. In the murky light, Zichen stood and officially proclaimed that we were dissolving Whale. He ended by repeating our credo: against philistinism. We also stood against realism and political writing. Personally, Zichen believed novels should be unstructured, without a defined centre. They should be full of riddles that didn’t need to be answered. He thought it was difficult to lead a purely literary life in this country. We finished the booze, and felt sad.

We didn’t see each other for a while after the magazine closed, maybe three or four months. During this time I almost married a guy I met at a friend’s wedding, and Dawei split up with the woman in the UK he’d been dating long-distance for the last two years. We phoned each other to share the pain of our broken hearts. Realising we hadn’t seen Zichen for a while, we each called him separately, which is how we found out he’d broken a leg and had been lying at home for two months. We wanted to see him but he turned us down. I called Dawei, who said, I’m going anyway, he needs us. I’d like to see him too, I said, I feel like we’re losing him. We kept calling Zichen until he said okay, we could get together, but not at his home. We arranged to meet by a lake in a park. It was a strange encounter. Dawei and I arrived at the appointed time to find Zichen already there, waiting alone in his wheelchair. It was evening and there was no one in sight, just wild ducks flying across the water. He seemed to have been there a while, part of the landscape. When we said goodbye, he insisted that we leave first. Someone would pick him up soon, he said. We left him alone by the lake.

It was at that meeting that Zichen first brought up Hai Tong, whose book he’d been reading. Neither of us had heard of her. We asked if we ought to have done.

Not many people have read her work, he said. She’s very mysterious, no one knows where she lives. Remember in 2666 when three academics travel to Mexico in search of Benno von Archimboldi? Maybe Hai Tong is our Archimboldi. Do you mean – we should go searching for her? Dawei asked. The best way to get close to an author is to become part of their story, Zichen said. We all like Bolaño, right? Fiction is a kind of spell, I said, and analysing a story is an exorcism. It loses all its mystery. All great fiction is a maze, Zichen said. You can’t understand if you haven’t walked through it. Dawei pointed at Zichen’s cast, We’d better wait till you’re back on your feet, though.

After saying goodbye to Zichen, Dawei and I went for dinner. Zichen looked a bit fragile, Dawei said, like he hadn’t spoken to anyone for a while. It’s true, I said, being alone for too long gives you all kinds of peculiar ideas. He replied, You’re not wrong, we should go see him again next week.

When I got home, I looked up Hai Tong. She’d published a novel in 2008, The Pleiades, which was now out of print. The used-book site I checked only listed one seller in Beijing. I bought a copy, and later learned Dawei had done the same. Our books arrived the following day. By that time, I’d read all the information about Hai Tong I could find on the internet. The publication of The Pleiades had caused some controversy. Readers were outraged by the graphic scenes: a young boy sexually assaulted by an older man, a woman masturbating with a police truncheon, a teacher suffocating a cat in a piano, a water cooler full of blood. Critics assumed these sensational moments were there for spectacle, to attract readers’ eyeballs. Four hundred and eighty seven pages of chaos, with no structure to speak of. Reading it, you had no idea what the author was trying to say. Some readers said they felt so uncomfortable they wanted to fling the book from a window. Others said they pitied the author, who was clearly a confused woman with severe childhood trauma. The novel was resolutely ignored by the literary establishment until a prominent award unexpectedly named it Book of the Year. The citation went: This book is impossible to summarise or analyse. It manifests the author’s abundant life force and unrestrained talent. Hai Tong didn’t attend the ceremony. Her editor explained she was travelling abroad. When interviewed afterwards, this tall, skinny man with black-rimmed glasses confessed he’d never actually met Hai Tong in person, they’d only ever emailed. The reporter – who seemed in a rush to get home in time for the school run – tried to wrap things up by asking, In your view, what kind of person is Hai Tong? The editor pushed his glasses up his nose and said, I sense that she’s a little plump, even though she doesn’t eat much, and that she’s on the shy side, with a quiet voice, and . . . The reporter put her recorder away and said, All right, thank you, we look forward to reading more of Hai Tong’s books.

The book arrived by courier at five in the evening. I ripped open the parcel, sat at my dining table, and began reading. A bizarrely scattered narrative voice, like someone shouting into a gale. The protagonist is a thirty-year-old novelist who can’t stand her husband and eventually leaves him. She moves into the home of a reader she meets at an event, a single mother of a nine-month-old boy. Each day, after the reader leaves for work, the author tells the infant macabre fairy tales of her own creation: a goldfish becoming infatuated with a fisherman, the moon burying her bastard son, Rapunzel strangling a suitor with her own hair. These stories take up thirty pages of the novel, but just as it’s threatening to turn into A Thousand and One Nights, the author decides to leave. She brings the boy along – he can walk by then. They take a cable car up a mountain. Along the way, the author realises the passenger sitting across from them is her mother’s lover. The novel then flashes back to the author’s childhood: her father, a soldier, is stationed overseas, and her mother leaves her with an uncle while she meets her lover. The uncle, a deaf artist, uses the little girl as his model. His paintings are influenced by Chinese erotica from the medieval period, except they are dour rather than exuberant. He removes the young girl’s clothes and ties her to a Ming dynasty four-poster bed. One day, before he can have his way with her, she struggles free of the ropes, punches him to the ground, and flees. That very night she is on a train to Beijing, where she finds work as a model. Sitting beneath the skylight of an art studio, she pops mints into her mouth as the boys bend their heads over their drawings. When her mother tracks her down she asks after the lover, but her mother says she no longer has one. Oh right, he was dealt with during the 1988 crackdown. The novel switches to his story, minus the author’s mother. All of that in chapter one.

In the second chapter, the reader’s son – now fifteen – takes an older girl to an abandoned building in the city centre. In the basement is a door to a dark passageway where a white flower grows. The next fifty pages are a botanical treatise about this plant, which can survive without photosynthesis, and arrived in China via Persia. A history of the passageway followed. In the Republican era, the abandoned building was the residence of a Kuomintang official, who fled there with his family during the liberation of Beiping. One of his concubines chooses not to escape, but hangs herself in the attic. Then the novel goes into the concubine’s story, and her reasons for not wanting to leave. The second chapter ends with the boy telling the girl that as a child he’d spent two years living in this passageway.

The third chapter, which has nothing to do with the first two, is about three young people leaving the city and going to the countryside to return to an agricultural way of life. One by one, the young people go missing, and their newly-built village becomes a ghost town. This is interspersed with increasingly gory tales of actual village ghosts, hinting that they were responsible for the young people’s gruesome deaths. This chapter is titled ‘Speedwell’, with a note at the end: Speedwell: a type of figwort the shape of a dog’s bollock, allegedly possessing the power to banish ghosts.

The fourth chapter returns to the author, now aged thirty-nine, homeless and itinerant. She is happy living this way, though from time to time she wishes she could have a hot shower. Her editor lets her have a mailbox in his office, where readers can leave their keys. She goes to the addresses they send her, chats with them, and uses their showers. Sometimes she gets caught up in the moment and ends up in bed with them. The novel ends on a sunny Sunday afternoon, the protagonist walking up the stairs of a building she’s never been in before, pressing her ear to the door to listen for movement inside, inserting a key into the lock.

I read the novel in three sittings, pausing only to sleep. The second time I laid down I dreamt of the author. She was in the garden downstairs, feeding a cat. When I approached, she and the cat both darted into the undergrowth. I drew her from memory when I woke up: sharp chin, high cheekbones, pale brown catlike eyes (or maybe this detail was muddling her with the cat). I finished the book at noon. Starving, I ordered a pizza and stood at the window, waiting. I found some of the details in the novel already blurring in my mind, as if they’d melted and were seeping into the folds of my brain. A forceful melding, a sort of colonising. My memories were being replaced by the novel. I could clearly recall the white flower in the tunnel. The doorbell rang. The pizza was here, even though I hadn’t seen the delivery person come down the one road to my building. As if he’d always been concealed within these walls, and just changed into his red uniform. Perhaps he had many identities. At some level I understood that these wild conjectures meant my way of seeing the world had been fundamentally altered.

That night I phoned Dawei to ask about going to see Zichen. Have you read it? he asked. I understood that he’d read the book as well, and abruptly we fell silent. After a long while, he said, I can’t tell if the book is any good. Uh-huh, I said. I’m not sure I understood it, he said. I have a lot of questions. But – how should I put this? – I feel like I’m in the story. Do you understand? His voice was raspy, as if he’d just woken up. Yes, I said, I understand. What do you think of the book? he said. I’ve just finished it, I said, I’m exhausted, I need to sleep. But tell me what you think, he said, I need to talk about it. If you hadn’t called me, I’d have called you. I said, This novel isn’t about love, guilt or sex, it’s about loneliness. I feel very lonely having read it. I know I’m lonely, but I don’t often feel it. He said, I understand. We were silent for a moment. Should we visit Zichen tomorrow? he asked. I said yes.

This time round Zichen agreed to see us more readily, though once again he insisted on meeting by the lake. It was raining when we got there. A park-keeper who’d been cutting grass came over and said, Your friend is waiting in the pavilion. We jogged over and found Zichen alone in his wheelchair, completely dry even though it had been raining for more than an hour. His cast had been removed, and the leg was visibly smaller than the other one. I thought it looked dainty, ladylike. Zichen said he could walk now, but hadn’t wanted to show up struggling with crutches. He asked what we’d been reading, and neither of us answered. Finally, Dawei said, Why did you start looking for Hai Tong? There are lots of things I don’t understand about her novel, Zichen said. She might not understand them herself, Dawei said. Zichen smiled. True, she must be full of plot holes. That’s precisely why it’s interesting to look for her. Like in 2666, when they go in search of the German who’s been nominated for the Nobel Prize. That’s no different to us seeking out an author not many people know about. The search has a significance greater than the person being searched for. Let’s get real: this country is dead, and if you want a rich literary life, you need action. We can’t have demonstrations or public gatherings, so what’s left?

It costs a lot to write like this, I said. Maybe Hai Tong will never do it again – The Pleiades might be her only book. Zichen said, You forget that in the novel, she says being an author is innate, not a profession. Even if she never writes another word, she’ll always be an author. Besides, I sense that she won’t stop writing, it’s the only way she can prove she exists.

You haven’t fallen in love with her, have you? Dawei asked. Falling in love with someone so remote would be very painful, Zichen said. No one on earth understands her work as well as you, I said. Not necessarily, Zichen said. Her editor must too. We should start with him, then, Dawei said.

That night, I dreamt the sailor’s ghost wanted to join our search for Hai Tong. Take me with you, he said. I’ve left the ocean and I’m quickly turning into a wind-dried relic. What about the girl? I said. She left me after you stopped writing your novel. Maybe she’s long gone, but hasn’t told you yet. Oh, I said, I sensed that too. He shrugged. An unfinished novel is like unset amber. Time still moves forward, no? I’m sorry I made you sad, I said. I’m not crying, he said. I’m no Marguerite Duras character, they’re always weeping. You’re destroying me, you’re good for me. You’d never write a line like that. I might, I said. I’m not a generous person.

I wrote to the editor of The Pleiades, asking if we could meet. He replied half a month later, explaining that he’d left the publishing house and they’d taken a while to forward the email. He was grateful for my interest in Hai Tong, and offered to meet the following week. I didn’t mention I’d be bringing two friends, so when we showed up at the coffee shop he was at a table for two. By this time Zichen was able to walk with the help of a stick, which looked quite dashing. It made me want to get him a top hat. Seeing us, the editor hastily moved to a larger table, shook our hands, and sat back down.

How should I put this? he said, pushing his glasses up his nose. I feel like Hai Tong’s best days are behind her. We’ve had some opportunities, but they didn’t work out. He sighed gently. Did you hope this book would get more attention? I said. That’s what I promised her, he said. When I came across The Pleiades online, she’d only posted the opening, and I very much wanted to know what came next, so I emailed her. She responded quickly, with the entire manuscript. You’re the fifteenth person to ask for this, she wrote, thank you. I read it, and though there were some flaws, it was clearly a unique creation. I wrote back saying I’d like to publish it, and asked her to meet so we could talk about revisions. She replied that for reasons she didn’t want to go into we couldn’t meet, and that she wasn’t prepared to make any changes to the novel. I told her we had to consider the readers – there couldn’t be such a proliferation of characters, and the secondary storylines shouldn’t take up as much space as the main ones. She replied that a novel is like a computer program, and every character is an unknown variable. They’re of equal value, and the calculations for each one must be completed before returning to base. I tried persuading her a couple more times, but she wouldn’t budge. Faced with an author who wouldn’t show herself and refused to make any changes, I ought to have given up. I put the manuscript in a drawer, but a few days later, I took it out for another look, and began making changes – Dawei interrupted, So the published version is your edit? The editor shook his head. I only revised twenty-four pages before I fell ill. I lay in bed for two days, and during that time I changed my mind: I would publish the novel without touching a word. I spent a lot of time winning over my bosses. As you’ve seen, it contains a lot of sensitive material. The day before we went to print, Hai Tong emailed asking to cancel. She didn’t give a reason. I chose to ignore her. When the book was out, I wrote her back: Trust me, this book will create a stir, and lots of people will fall in love with you. I asked for her address to send her copies. She replied with just one line: No need, I’ve bought one. Unfortunately, a few months later, the book was banned and taken off the shelves. Why do you think Hai Tong wouldn’t reveal herself ? Zichen asked. I don’t know, the editor said, maybe to protect her real identity. Do you think anything in the novel is based on fact? I said. I believe everything in it is true, he said. It’s right in front of your eyes. But everyone just thinks I’ve been poisoned by the book. Does anyone suspect you know where she is? Dawei asked. Of course, the editor replied. I bet you think so too. Go ahead. I’ve been attacked so many times because of this book! That’s why you resigned? I asked. That had something to do with it, yes. But mainly the publishing house refused to put out any further books by Hai Tong. She wrote more books? Zichen said. She never mentioned any, the editor said, but I told her if she ever did, I’d find somewhere to publish them. You’re very loyal to her, I said. The editor smiled. I’m just trying to find something to do, otherwise my life would be empty. She must have signed a contract for the book, Dawei said. Her real name and address would be on that. The editor said, I took a risk and signed the contract in my ex-girlfriend’s name. No one noticed. And her advance? Dawei said. Did you send that to her? Yes, along with the keys. What keys? Dawei said. When the book was first out, the publishing house had a promotion: readers could post their keys to a PO box and we’d pass them on to Hai Tong. The idea was that, just like in the book, she might show up at people’s homes one day. The book had been out for a month. Sales were bad, and everyone was shouting at us on the internet. A colleague thought up the idea. Imagine it, she said. One day you’ll open your front door and there’ll be a strange woman sitting in your living room. A once-in-a-lifetime encounter. I told her I didn’t believe people would send in their house keys just like that, but we got a dozen in less than a fortnight, all with little cards giving the address. We hadn’t asked Hai Tong beforehand, and I assumed she’d say to throw them away, but instead she said her cheque and the keys could both go to a safety deposit box at a bank. Even now we occasionally receive a set of keys, and my colleague forwards them. Dawei chuckled. You haven’t sent your own keys, have you? I don’t play silly games! the editor said huffily, flushing bright red. We asked him for the address of the bank but he refused to tell us. I’m her editor, he said, I’m happy to answer questions, but I won’t help you find her. With that, he stood and left the cafe. We sat a while longer. I have a feeling Hai Tong was secretly watching all that, I said. Right, Dawei said, maybe she’s hearing every word we’re saying now. Zichen smiled. He’d become very smiley since breaking his leg, as if the smiles were oozing from his wound. Maybe Hai Tong is waiting for us to find her, he said. I’m wondering about the people who actually sent her keys, Dawei said, think how lonely they must be. The cafe lights dimmed, and the woman behind the counter started closing out the cash register. Let’s go, I said. The other cafe was better, let’s meet there in two days.

As it turned out, the cafe with the fans had closed down and been replaced by a children’s swimming school. A huge inflatable cartoon fish bobbed up and down by the entrance. I think that’s a whale, Dawei said. Maybe in memoriam to our magazine. Years later, Zichen said, one of these kids will open an issue of Whale and remember the first time they saw a whale. This reminded me of the dream I’d had the previous night: the ghost sailor’s face twisted in pain, as if he’d just risen from a cage in hell. You’ve never stopped to think about the protagonists whose novels are never finished, he said. Do you know how we live? Wandering the world like lonely ghosts.

We found another cafe nearby. It was deserted and the coffee tasted of rubber – by the look of things, it wouldn’t be in business for long either. We started meeting there every few days, trying to bring a new discovery each time. There was a description in the novel of the four-year-old author watching her uncle climb a ladder to paint a family-planning propaganda mural; Dawei believed this must be based on experience, which meant Hai Tong was probably a few years younger than her protagonist, an only child. She’d have been frail when she was young, bad at sports, not great at music or art either. She probably had a sweet tooth and liked chocolate with nuts, and would also have been fond of nougat and pineapple cakes. Zichen tracked down the abandoned building from the novel, which had indeed been the residence of a Kuomintang official, though it had since been torn down. An office block was being built on the site. None of the news stories mentioned a secret tunnel, but three construction workers mysteriously went missing during the demolition, and their whereabouts were still unknown. Zichen believed the plant in the tunnel must be a mutation of speedwell, whose blue flowers might have turned white in the absence of sunlight. The flower represented two choices in life: exorcism or the summoning of demons.

As for me, I found the start of the novel in a niche literary forum, the same one the editor had stumbled upon. Hai Tong never posted anything else, nor had she replied to any comments. Her profile picture looked like a wash of black, but when I enlarged it I spotted a tiny white flower in one corner. The image was blurry, as if taken in dim light. There was an email address on the profile, and we started discussing what kind of message to send. Should we pretend to be a reporter, or maybe an overseas publisher interested in her novel? In the end, we decided to tell the truth. We shared a few thoughts about The Pleiades, added some questions, and ended with a sincere request to meet. I wrote that last bit: First of all, we’re grateful to you for bringing the three of us together. We hope to gain a deeper understanding of particular elements of your novel in order to separate ourselves from ordinary people, and to confirm our belief that literature is the only exit for the soul. We all believe we will meet you one day – either we will move towards you or vice versa. If you are willing to move towards us, we very much look forward to seeing you. Dawei wanted to add a few lines from one of his poems, but we dissuaded him.

There was no reply to the email. Another fortnight passed, then Zichen made a new discovery. A seller on a used-book website had changed their listing of The Pleiades – at first there had been three copies available, now there were ten. What did that mean? It looked like the seller was hoarding the book. We emailed the seller to ask for a meeting, under the pretext of needing help to track down some old books. He replied with an address, and said we should call him when we were nearby. We did as he said and found ourselves surrounded by farmland, although none of us could identify the crop. A man in a straw hat appeared and led us down a narrow road to a courtyard. Three dogs were slumped on the ground, asleep. We sat beneath a trellis and the man offered us home-brewed cider, which tasted odd. One of the dogs – with a black-and-white coat – woke up and came over, sniffed at my cup, and walked away. Dawei said, Do you have many copies of The Pleiades? The man took off his straw hat to reveal prematurely white hair. A few hundred, he said. I’ve been slowly gathering them from all over. Why? I said. If bookshops aren’t able to sell them, they’ll return them to the publishing house, where they’ll eventually get pulped, he said. I want to keep the book available for readers. I said, You’re doing this out of love for Hai Tong. It’s an act of protection, maybe, he said. Everyone has something they want to defend, and if they don’t, they create that something themselves. Zichen asked what he thought of Hai Tong. I feel she must be dead, he said. When I read The Pleiades, I got the strong sense that the author hated the world. On the one hand, I detected a strong life force in the pages; on the other, it felt like she wanted to destroy that life force. In a way, the whole novel was a suicide note. The author was saying: I want to die, can you find me before that happens? The three of us remained silent. The man went on, Of course, that’s just how I felt after reading the book. It was only an inkling to start with, but it got stronger day after day. One morning, I sat up in bed absolutely certain Hai Tong was dead. From that day on I’ve been buying up every copy of The Pleiades I can find. Maybe I’m wrong, but her being dead is a better fit for my aesthetic sensibility, it allows me to nurture certain fantasies, the sort I can spend a lot of time in.

In the sunlight the cider had begun to reek of decay. The man confessed that his brewing was very much at an experimental stage, and he might have overdone the hops. Drink up, drink up, he said. You won’t get drunk. Have you always lived here? Dawei asked. Oh, no, I used to live closer to the city, in a house full of old books. One night, the room with all my books caught fire. Were there many copies of The Pleiades? Dawai asked. Yes, he said. I lost many but a few survived. After that, I moved out here. Do you think someone set your house on fire to destroy those books? Dawei asked. I don’t know, he said, maybe it was a coincidence. I’m a simple person, I like to find simple explanations for things. You can tell by the way we’re sitting here chatting, can’t you? Dawei said. We didn’t come here to burn books! The man laughed and said, There are too many books, you’d never be able to burn them all.

Before we left, he gave us a tour of the vegetable garden. Pointing at the watermelons nestled in the soil, he said, Their patterns change – you notice when you stare at them every day. Then he gazed at an empty field in the distance and said, Maybe not long from now there’ll be a library here, with a restaurant, a small events hall, glass-roofed, so when you look up at night the stars would seem to be tumbling down from the sky. Just like in The Pleiades? I said. Ha, he said. I’ll have to remember to plant speedwell to keep ghosts away.

We were back at the desolate cafe. Autumn had arrived, and scraps of fallen leaves kept blowing through the open window, landing in our cooling coffee. Do you think she’s dead? I asked. I don’t think so, Zichen said, but I agree with that guy. The Pleiades is filled with the atmosphere of death. Hai Tong might have already planned her suicide. We need to find her soon, Dawei said. Death can’t be prevented, Zichen said. If someone really was trying to burn all those books, who would that person be? I said. Probably Hai Tong herself, Dawei said. She didn’t want the novel to remain in the world. Remember in The Pleiades, when the author says she wishes she could have 3,999 readers, no more and no less? The print run was probably more than that, right? The used-book website doesn’t give an address, I said. How would she have found the place? As long as she bought something from the site, she’d have a return address, Zichen said. That’s insane, Dawei said, you mean she looked at the address on the delivery slip, found the shop, slipped inside one night and set the books on fire? That’s what I like about her, Zichen said, her madness.

I phoned the white-haired man and asked for the contact details of everyone who’d bought a copy of The Pleiades. He chuckled, For a book club? Yes, I said, I want to hear what other people thought of the novel. You’re trying to find more clues about Hai Tong, aren’t you? he said. We’re choosing to believe she’s still alive, I said. Good, let me know if you learn anything new, he said. Oh, also, I’ve finally perfected the cider.

According to the sales list, the white-haired man had sold sixteen copies of The Pleiades, twelve to people in other cities. The editor said Hai Tong’s safe deposit box was in a Beijing bank, so we decided to start with the four locals. We called them one by one to say we were setting up a book club for The Pleiades, and would they like to take part? The first three were men. One said he’d forgotten he ever bought the book. Another said he’d only read it because he was interested in haunted buildings, but that section wasn’t scary at all, and he’d been disappointed. The third said he’d love to join our book club, and we told him we’d be in touch soon with a time and place. The fourth person we called was a woman. She said she wasn’t interested and hung up. Her delivery address was Room 217 in the literature department of a local university. The name on the order form was Professor Luo.

We went to the university and found Room 217: a small office, full of plants, that felt like a tropical greenhouse. A young man was filling out a form beneath a large-leafed specimen. We asked if there was a Professor Luo here and he said, Oh yes, Professor Luo Xuewei. She’s not here right now. We said we were hoping to sit in on one of her classes, could he tell us when the next one would be? The man tapped at the computer and said, Two o’clock on Thursday, seminar in Room 2113. As he walked us to the door, he said, You won’t have many chances left. We asked what he meant, and he said, Professor Luo is leaving halfway through the semester, she’s having a baby.

We left the literature department and walked through the withered grass outside the entrance. She’s having a baby, I said. Dawei glanced at me, You seem sad about that, as if a man you love had betrayed you. Zichen said, Maybe she delayed her suicide because she got pregnant. Dawei said, I wonder what kind of person she married.

On Thursday afternoon we arrived at the classroom punctually and sat in the last row. There were more than twenty students, some with purple hair, some with nose rings. A woman in the front row said to the man next to her, I had some Prozac with my beer and it made me see a mirage. I grew up by the sea, and I’ve always been embarrassed to admit that I’ve never seen a Fata Morgana.

Professor Luo arrived, her belly pressing against her black sweater dress. She walked up to the lectern and said, Today we’ll discuss Joyce’s short story ‘The Dead’, I trust you’ve all had a chance to read it. The story’s quite bland, a young man said. Professor Luo shook her head. There’s enormous sorrow buried beneath the surface. Another man raised his hand. Professor, do you have erotic dreams about your exes? The man next to him said, Do women have erotic dreams when they’re pregnant? Professor Luo didn’t lose her temper. She never stopped smiling. In a level tone, she began analysing the short story, repeating words like pain, grief and shadow. The students kept interrupting her to speak of their own sorrows: being tormented by their fathers, falling out of love, contemplating suicide. The professor’s gaze was serene, like a pastor listening to her congregants. After the seminar, we asked the student next to us what the class was called. She said she didn’t remember, but anyway Professor Luo only talked about books that made people sad. We asked if that was what the professor was interested in, and she said, No, it’s what we need, we all enjoy heart-rending stories.

We went back to Professor Luo’s office and found her watering the plants. She swung around, startling us as much as we had her. She brought out chairs for us, and we sat amid the greenery. We asked about her class, which had seemed to us like a form of counselling. Yes, she said, the kids who choose my class all have psychological issues. Sad stories help them to process their inner torments. Do you write? Dawei asked. A bit at university, she said but then I stopped. We exchanged glances. Zichen said, Have you ever read a novel called The Pleiades? Yes, she said. I asked if she’d enjoyed it, and she smiled. Of course I enjoyed it, it’s my story. Well, not all of it, but a portion. That’s one of the lingering effects of the book, I said. When I was done I also felt as if I’d personally witnessed some of these things, for example the white flower in the tunnel. Dawei and Zichen said, That’s right, us too. Professor Luo said, Did your mothers all have lovers who got executed, and did your uncles make you serve as art models? We fell silent. She said the childhood experiences of the author in the novel were almost exactly the same as hers. Okay, Dawei said. Who else knew these things happened to you? I had a flatmate at university, Professor Luo said, we were really close, and I told her all about my childhood. She encouraged me to write the story down, and I tried, but my psychological state worsened and I had to drop out of school. Zichen said, Are the words in the novel the same as the ones you wrote? I can’t really remember what I wrote, Professor Luo said. People told me the plot of The Pleiades, but I didn’t dare to read it myself. I wanted to reread my own version first, but I couldn’t find it anywhere. In the end I bought a second-hand copy of the novel, and once I’d read it, the story replaced my own memories. Now the only thing I know is: this is my story. Dawei asked, What kind of person was your flatmate? A very tall, thin girl, Professor Luo said. She never talked about herself. I took two years off, and by the time I returned she’d graduated and changed her phone number – maybe she didn’t want me to get in touch. When I thought back, I realised I’d never known anything about her past. Dawei asked, Did she have a sweet tooth? She was a little bit anorexic, Professor Luo said, she mostly lived on celery juice. Do you hate her for stealing your story? I asked. The image of her in my mind has grown blurry, and I just can’t believe this book was written by the person I knew, she said. Whenever I recollect my childhood, my memory slides towards the events of the novel. I’ve become a person without a past. That’s why I am in need of a future. She clasped her hands over her belly as if to warm them there.

Winter arrived. We huddled in a corner of the cafe. Swaddled in a jumper, the waitress watched expressionlessly as a worker installed a heater. Professor Luo had given us her former flatmate’s name: Chen Sining. According to the alumni website she’d moved to Spain after graduation, and now lived in Córdoba. There were three pictures on her page: a bullfighting ring in Zaragoza, a performer dancing flamenco in Sevilla, and a selfie on the balcony of her flat, surrounded by bougainvillea. We searched the university’s chatboard for her ID, and found one post: she’d asked on a beauty forum if anyone who’d had breast augmentation surgery found their ribs hurt so badly afterwards they didn’t dare to sneeze? No responses. Just a question from 2011, dangling lonely on the page. Before our eyes floated the image of a woman far from home, trying to suppress a sneeze.

We began to despair. Perhaps we had trouble believing an author would care about the size of her bust. Dawei suggested a trip to Córdoba – he’d put up the money. Maybe Córdoba will be our Araby, he said. We have to go. Zichen looked at the bare branches outside the window and said, ‘The Last Leaf ’ is a terrible short story, but to be honest, if someone painted me a leaf like that, I’d be so grateful. Dawei said, Córdoba is warm and has a lot of leafy trees. I hope so, Zichen said. Even if she isn’t the person we’re looking for, it won’t matter, Dawei said. We could just stay in Spain until I’ve spent all my savings.

A golden minaret was visible in the background of the balcony photo. We circled all the mosques on a map of Córdoba, and booked a hotel near one of them.

The day before we were due to leave, Zichen swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills. He was still breathing when his elderly aunt found him, and she called an ambulance. Unfortunately, the roads were blocked off – a president was being whisked to the airport after a five-day state visit. The ambulance was caught on the wrong side of the cordon, red light flashing like an augury. By the time they reached the hospital, Zichen was dead.

Dawei and I were at his funeral, which was sparsely attended. The other guests didn’t seem to know each other and left right after the ritual. I went over to speak to the elderly aunt, who didn’t seem particularly sad – more relieved. When I suggested I could come by in a few days to help sort through Zichen’s possessions, she told me to come after three, because her afternoon naps were lasting longer and longer these days. Dawei had gone outside for a smoke. I found him under a pine tree. It was freezing, and sleet was falling. The quadrangular sky looks like the grimace of a robot, I said, and Dawei smiled bleakly.

I fell ill afterwards, and my fever refused to lift. I phoned Dawei and said I might not have the courage to go through Zichen’s things. He said he understood. I’ll go. Take care of yourself. I said, You too.

Dawei and I didn’t see each other for four months after that. During this time I moved house, went on a couple of dates, and started seeing someone regularly. I got several phone calls from the man we’d invited asking whether The Pleiades book club was happening and complaining that we’d never gotten in touch with the details. The sailor’s ghost showed up again, regaling me with stories of his failed romances. I warned him not to lose himself in love. Characters in novels aren’t like real people, he said. They inevitably end up living for just one thing. The personality you created for me had nothing in it but love. I asked if he’d met other characters from unfinished novels. Yes, he said, and every woman I meet is in the same condition – they’re like embryos who never finished developing. That’s why they drift around. I asked if he could help track down a character from a friend’s novel. The author’s name was Wu Zichen. He said, I’ll give it a try, although we don’t usually mention our authors’ names, unless the author is very famous – those characters constantly name-drop their creators. They think they’re better than the rest of us.

In April Dawei phoned, asking to meet. He sounded solemn, like he had something terribly important to impart. We’ll have to go somewhere new, he said. The cafe’s closed down. And so we went to the bookshop where we’d met that first time. The ground-floor coffee shop had been renovated, and the waiter told us there was still time to sign up for their flower-arranging class. Dawei sat across from me, fingers interlaced. He had a tan and was growing a beard. I asked if he’d been on holiday. He leaned forward and said, in a low voice, I found Hai Tong. I put down my coffee cup and stared at him. Where is she? His face contorted. Zichen was Hai Tong, he said. I shook my head. That’s not possible. I’ve spent these past few months investigating, he said, and there’s no doubt.

While Dawei was smoking on the day of the funeral, a short man in a tight woollen overcoat had come over and asked for a light. The man asked, Are you Zichen’s friend? Dawei said yes. The man nodded and said, Me too. He seemed to be caught up in the past, and words spilled out of him. He told Dawei that he and Zichen had been in a relationship for the last seven years. Dawei didn’t show any surprise, he said he and Zichen had literary interests in common, but never talked about their personal lives. Ah, literature! The small man nodded. I remember Zichen once told me he wanted to write a book from a woman’s point of view, concealing himself so no one would know he was the author. Dawei, hiding his shock, asked, But why a woman’s point of view? The small man said, Probably he felt people might be prejudiced against a gay author, and if he had to choose between the voice of a straight man or a woman, he preferred the woman. Did he write it? Dawei said. I don’t know, the man said, we lost touch. I don’t think he’d have expected me to show up today.

Dawei paused for a moment. He’d gone to Zichen’s flat to sort through his things, but didn’t find any diaries or handwritten manuscripts. In fact, it looked like someone had already tidied everything up. In a bag that looked as if it hadn’t been used in a long time he found a bundle of notepapers on which were written unrelated names and scattered phrases. The words ‘tunnel’ and ‘cable car’ appeared several times. A few of the papers were dated 2010, prior to the publication of The Pleiades. Pressed between the sheets was a white flower. That could all be coincidence, I said. Think about it, Dawei said, when we were searching for Hai Tong, every clue was provided by Zichen, right? Why would he help us find her? I asked. He needed devoted readers who would keep his legacy alive. He chose us. Weren’t we completely hooked? I burst into tears. Dawei said, Professor Luo’s flatmate, Chen Sining – she must have known him, and told him the professor’s life story. That’s why he didn’t want to go to Córdoba, get it? He sighed. Zichen’s aunt told me he broke his leg jumping from the fourth-floor balcony – he’d already tried to kill himself once. That’s enough for today, I said. Let’s go home.

I phoned Dawei the next morning and we met again that afternoon in the bookshop cafe. I didn’t sleep last night, I said. Maybe I shouldn’t have told you, he said. I hated him to start with, I said, but by dawn I’d stopped hating him. I kind of admire him, that he could sacrifice his whole life for literature. We couldn’t do that. Dawei said, It’s true, we couldn’t, because we only get this one life. We stayed at the cafe till it closed, then went to a bar. We met again the following afternoon, and went straight to the bar this time. The next week passed like this. Neither of us brought up literature or Zichen, we just talked idly about this and that. He regretted giving up football after university, I was thinking of enrolling in a baking class. We kept reminding each other to live well, but this prolonged encouragement only revealed our confusion. One evening the following week, the bar was full of football fans. Dawei asked if I wanted to come to his place. I did. His house was huge and empty, with a garden that was also empty, even though it was May. I keep meaning to plant some flowers, Dawei said. Aha, I said. What should I plant? I said, Chinese roses or Japanese roses? Okay, he said, I’ll look into which variety I should buy. Your neighbour’s garden is full of them, I said, just ask for a few. But I’ve never spoken to them before. I said, All the more reason to. Didn’t we say we were going to embrace life wholeheartedly?

I didn’t leave that night. The next morning, we held hands as we walked up to the neighbour’s house and rang the bell. The neighbour gave us three Japanese rose cuttings, and dug up five of their Chinese rose bushes. It took Dawei and me all day to plant them. Then we rushed to the supermarket just before it closed to get bath towels and slippers.

We were married a month later, and I was pregnant two months after that. I completely redecorated the house, and we invited our new friends to come and visit. Another two months passed, and Dawei began working at his dad’s company. On days when he had an important meeting I would get up early to help him knot his tie. I’d put on twenty pounds, and my face was covered in freckles. I spent my days in bed, drifting in and out of sleep. My dreams were like pure water, filtered so many times there wasn’t a single stray thought left. I went for afternoon walks and got to know two women even more pregnant than me. They never grew tired of discussing the best kinds of pram or milk powder, or swapping horror stories of children who’d been kidnapped by rogue nannies. I got the sense they liked me because I was so ignorant, and was always staring blankly at them. My God, they would shriek with a sort of satisfaction, don’t you even know that?

Yangping was born two months premature and had to spend a fortnight in an incubator. During that time I often felt as if I was merely ill, and forgot I’d had a baby, only to be startled when the nurse brought him in. He was tiny, like an exposed heart. Don’t worry, Dawei said, he’ll grow up big and strong.

He woke up many times through the night, slicing my sleep to shreds. Sometimes after he’d drifted off I’d sit by the window, not bothering to button my top, waiting for him to wake again. I’d look out at the garden, where the transplanted roses still hadn’t bloomed, just bare branches without so much as a single leaf.

Dawei started drinking heavily and got home late each night. He’d complain that his colleagues had insulted him, that they’d made him look bad, that his father was always saying what a disappointment he was. One day I replied, It’s just a job. That’s true, Dawei said, but what do I have apart from this job? Nothing, I said. I know what you’re thinking, he said, you feel I’ve become a philistine and can’t do anything well. You’re disappointed in me too, aren’t you? No matter what kind of life I give you, you won’t be satisfied, you won’t even greet me with a fucking smile when I get home. The baby’s crying, I said. Let him cry! We sat there amid our child’s bawling. He howled for a good while, then quietened to little sobs, and finally he stopped. Do you keep thinking about Zichen? Dawei said. Yes, I said, and so do you. It was a mistake for us to be together, Dawei said. Maybe. He slumped back on the sofa, despair on his face. Eventually he fell asleep. I kept sitting there waiting for the baby to summon me with more crying, and when he didn’t I shook him awake. He glanced at me, rolled over, and went back to sleep. I stood in the silent room for I don’t know how long, and then I heard someone rapping at the window: the sailor’s ghost, his smiling face pressed to the glass. I went into the garden. As soon as I stepped out, the ghost said, I found a character from that author you mentioned, Zichen. Who? I asked. A very cool girl, he said from a half-written sci-fi story. Science fiction? I said. Everything from her neck up is metal, he said. Her brain is brilliant – she can work out the cube of seven-digit numbers. Then, with some emotion, he added that he’d been wooing her for a very long time, and she had finally agreed to be his girlfriend the day before. He was very happy, he told me. Chills shot through him when they kissed. Everything was beautiful. I wish you both the best, I said. It’s all thanks to you and your friend, he said. He waved farewell. I turned off the outdoor lights and went back inside to take off my dew-soaked slippers.

I got up very early the next morning and made breakfast, then stood in the doorway and watched as Dawei left. When the baby had had his fill, I put him back in the cot and cleaned the whole house thoroughly before putting clothes in a suitcase. Just before leaving, I went to the bookcase for my copy of The Pleiades. I locked the door behind me and walked away with my suitcase. The sprinkler truck had passed by earlier and puddles of water were steaming in the bright sunlight. I got to the subway station, where the crowds pushed me into a carriage. A man elbowed me and looked away when I glared at him. At the next stop, I squeezed out onto the platform and sat on a bench, where I devoured the bun I’d brought. Out of nowhere, I felt homesick for the place I’d just left, though I couldn’t have said what it was I missed. I stuffed the last bite of bun into my mouth and crossed over to the opposite platform.

Back at my front door, I heard the baby squalling as I put down my suitcase and got out my keys. Without stopping to put on slippers I rushed into the living room. A woman was sitting by the cot. Her hair was in a thick braid, her skin was very tan and she was wearing a shapeless dark grey dress. I couldn’t tell how old she was. She was telling the child a story in a low voice.

Who are you? I said.

She smiled. I’m Hai Tong, she said. You posted me your key a long time ago, maybe last year. I’ve been too busy to come by till now.

I shook my head. I didn’t post you my key.

Oh? she said, It must have been someone else who lives here. There was a love poem on the note, very moving. She reached into the cot and caressed the baby’s face. He’s very good, she said. So quiet.

I had so many questions for her, the answers to all those riddles we thought would go unanswered forever. Instead I said, Please leave. This is my home.

She looked confused. The homeowner invited me.

I’m the homeowner, I said, and I’m asking you to leave. I pulled open the door and stood by it. She shook her head, muttering as she walked out, People these days are unbelievable.

I shut the door behind her and returned to the living room, which was radiant with sunlight. I sat by the window, tucked Yangping’s bear into his arm, and looked down at my sleeping child."

    "text": "That winter, Per was thirty-two and worked in a bookstore in SoHo. He lived with a couple in a fifth-floor Hell’s Kitchen walk-up, where he slept on a pull-out in what they called the living room but which was really everything that wasn’t the narrow strip of kitchen and the skinny bedroom. The toilet was in a closet and the tub was in the kitchen. Per didn’t mind sleeping on the pull-out, and he appreciated that the lack of space kept him from bringing books home from the store – strays, he called them. He stowed his things in a corner behind a Japanese screen and on a clothing rack behind the couch. He lived a tidy, monastic life amid the clutter of the couple, who for the most part alternated between doting on him like a helpless child and resenting his very presence with an alienating silence.

At first, Per found this a little confusing, but a friend explained that gay men over forty had a tendency to want to fuck you and also make you porridge and teach you to tie your shoes, and in the midst of this sexual confusion, they felt both rejected and parental, resulting in a wildly swinging ambivalence. Per acclimated to this strange weather, disappearing in the mornings and returning in the evenings with fresh cut flowers or pastries from their favorite shop or good coffee from the roasters downtown. They converted back to their doting selves upon receiving these gifts like furious gods of old going silent at the burning of offerings.

There was no lease of course, and they might have turned him out at any moment, but Per did feel a real fondness for the couple. They made elaborate dinners, mostly Eastern European – Hungarian and Polish fare. Per always brought bread home for dinner because there was a very good French bakery near the bookstore, and it made him feel like he was in a French film carrying baguettes down into the subway. He liked that he had a role to play in their apartment life. Bringing bread. Clearing and washing the dishes. Unfolding the dining table. Putting away the dining table after they had eaten. Rolling their post-dinner joint and setting up the cushions by the open window so they could smoke. Watering the plants. Seasoning the cast-irons. Discarding the coffee grounds for composting. These things made him happy.

Still, seven months into the arrangement, he knew it was not a long-term situation.

For one thing, he could hear the couple fucking. Initially, they did try to go about it stealthily, but after his first couple days in the apartment, they said to him over breakfast, ‘We’d like to fuck tonight. Don’t come back until after two.’

Per had never heard someone be so frank about sex before. Not toward him anyway. He gulped down his coffee and practically yelled, ‘Of course!’ as he leapt from the table.

The couple laughed, both of them, and Per felt embarrassed at his response and his clumsiness. Ever since, the couple had simply started engaging in sex when they felt like it, even while Per slept a few feet away in the living room on his lumpy mattress. He listened to them coo and sigh and the squeak of the platform bed shifting under their weight. Sometimes he got hard listening to them go at it because they’d curse and gasp and make brutal, hitching sounds. But for the most part, their sex made Per sad because it was so soft and gentle and they seemed to know each other so well. It made him realize no one knew him that well, and probably never would. He never felt so lonely as on the nights when those two made love.

In the bookstore, Per worked from morning until evening, mostly down in the stockroom unboxing and cataloguing shipments. Breaking down the boxes and setting them out for recycling. Making sure that the deliveries of receipt paper and hand soap made it upstairs and into the staff bathroom, which he also cleaned. Then there was the dusting before hours and the sweeping after close. Checking the light bulbs and making sure that the books were mostly put back into place. He felt a little like Quasimodo, to be honest, scurrying around in the shadows, peering out at the real people who had come to buy books for themselves and for loved ones, for gifts, for leisure, for work, for clout on Instagram and social media, to signify to whatever part of the world was still sensitive to such signals that this was a person who read – what such a signal meant in today’s world, Per did not really know.

One morning, pre-open in mid-November, Per’s boss said that they would have a party at the bookstore. They were all gathered on the first floor for an impromptu team meeting. Per had been summoned up from his crypt.

‘Like, a reading?’ someone asked.

‘No, a party. For the customers. To celebrate the start of the holiday season,’ Imogen, the shift lead, said.

There was a murmur of unease. Per had his hands in the pockets of his apron. He was thinking about the boxes he’d left on the counter downstairs and making a list in his head of which shipments he should open first.

‘I don’t suppose we have a choice,’ Anil, one of the senior booksellers, said.

‘From on high,’ Imogen said.

‘I don’t love, but I guess them’s the breaks.’

‘It’ll be early December.’

‘Are we . . . getting paid, at least?’

‘Some will be working. But of course everyone is invited to attend.’

‘So it’s not a party. It’s work.’

‘Festive work,’ Imogen said dryly. ‘I know it’s annoying. But please don’t shoot the messenger.’

Imogen said they were free to go, and Per descended the stairs into the children’s section so that he could cut into the back and resume his box duty. A party sounded nice. Working during a party did not sound so nice. But it might mean time and a half. And if he was on his regular stuff, then he’d be able to hide downstairs and avoid most of the trouble. That didn’t seem so bad. Imogen called after him as he reached the middle landing.

‘About the party,’ she said.

‘Festive work sounds better, I think.’

‘I don’t know about that,’ she said, but then, sighing, ‘It might be best if. We’re going to be running a tighter ship that day. We’ll be closing early to get the shop ready.’

‘Oh,’ Per said.

‘It’s not certain, but you might not. Be on. That night. But you would be totally welcome to come. And you know, be merry and bright. And. Secular in a seasonally appropriate manner.’

‘Am I being laid off ?’

Imogen frowned. ‘No.’ She descended the stairs and took his arm in hers and coaxed him further down. She glanced up behind them to make sure that no one was on the stairs and when they reached the children’s section, she put her hand on his shoulder.

‘I know how hard it is for you. These kinds of things. I spoke to Bette and she’s said that you don’t have to work that night if you don’t want to.’

Per’s neck was hot and his vision momentarily folded back and across itself, splitting everything in fuzzy doubles.

‘I’m not an invalid,’ he said.

‘I know that,’ Imogen said. ‘I know. Look, do what you want. I just wanted you to know it’s an option.’

Per’s mouth was dry and he stared at Imogen’s hand on his shoulder. She was older than him by about five or six years, but she had the steadfast and loose authority of a camp counselor, derived from a small yet intractable difference in age and experience. She had clear brown eyes and dark roots, but she was never cruel and she was never brutal and she was always fair. He tried to remind himself that other people’s kindness was not an indication of weakness on his part. He tried to remind himself of what his doctor had said. That it was okay for people to look out for him sometimes.

‘Thank you,’ he said. ‘That’s very thoughtful.’

She smiled at him and squeezed his arm. ‘You bet.’

Imogen went back upstairs and Per went into the back room and he lifted the yellow X-Acto knife from the counter and slit the boxes in the way he had been taught, drawing its edge away from himself at a depth sufficient to cut open the box but not to harm the books. He kept his wrist loose but firm, trying to make sure there was no excess tension so that he could do this all day without injury to himself. Early on, he had held the knife so tight that his knuckles went white and his palms shook. The key was consistent pressure, not too much, just enough to let the knife stay steady and to let the sharpness of the blade do the work. Cutting was easy that way. And to move the blade away from yourself, not toward, as was his instinct. Why was that? he wondered. What made him want to draw the knife toward him? Why was it not human nature to draw it the other way? The biomechanics made no sense. God had put humans together in such a strange and funny way.

Per looked down into the box: Frog and Toad.

–

Just before lunch, one of the girls, Siva, came into the back to collect her bag and coat. She and Emmaline, another bookseller, were going to the restaurant down the street for lunch.

‘Do you want something?’ she asked.

‘No. I’m all right,’ Per said. She stood by the back exit for a moment, the denim jacket hanging off her shoulders. Per had been unboxing all morning and his hands were raw from handling the cardboard and shrink-wrap. He’d nicked the inside of his palm along the webbing between his thumb and finger. When Siva had come in, he’d been in the process of putting a Band-Aid there only for it to come off a moment later.

‘It’s best if you use the tape,’ she said. ‘High flex area.’

He looked at his hand and at the open first-aid kit. It seemed rather obvious now.

‘Oh, you’re right,’ he said.

‘Do you want some help?’

‘No,’ he said. ‘I’m okay. I can do it.’

Siva put her jacket back on the hook and had Per sit on a stack of boxes. Then she wheeled a chair over and set about putting gauze between his fingers.

‘Press,’ she said. Per applied pressure and watched as she took the white medical tape from the box and did a couple quick, tight circles around and through. Then she secured it and checked her handiwork.

That close, he could see the red part of her hair, where her scalp was irritated and flaky. And he could smell something like oil and geranium on her. When she looked up, their faces were close, and he saw a ghostly white scar around the corner of her mouth.

‘Thank you,’ he said.

‘You’re welcome.’

They sat with their knees touching while overhead the early lunch foot traffic went groaning on.

‘Are you excited for the party?’ she asked.

‘No. Yes,’ he said. She laughed a little.

‘I think it’ll be fun. A good thing for people after the last couple shitty years.’

‘And if it’s not, we’ll be able to say it is anyway,’ he said.

‘Now you’re talking. Delusion is one of the best parts of the holiday season.’

Per nodded and looked down at the white bandage on his hand. It felt warm and tight. He felt looked after.

‘Are you going home for the holiday?’

‘No,’ Per said. ‘Not since I was in college. They don’t. I don’t. We don’t handle it well.’

‘The holidays?’

‘Each other,’ he said, laughing, snorting even, but then he saw that Siva was not smiling and realized that he’d said something troubling instead of funny again. ‘That’s a joke.’

‘Oh,’ she said.

‘Sorry. I’m. Unsettling.’

‘No you’re not,’ she said. But then she stood and took her jacket back off the hook. She did not offer, as she sometimes did, another invitation or offer to bring him something back.

‘I’m really sorry,’ he said, reaching, but then taking his hand back when he saw her eyebrows raise and her eyes widen. He put his hand against his stomach.

‘You’re fine,’ she said. ‘See you later.’

The door always creaked like it was in pain when you opened it and slammed shut when you closed it. It made the small break room feel extra quiet and empty. He stood a moment in the echo of the door and tried to think about what he could have done better. Might have done better. He tried to think about what sort of person he wanted to be in this world and how he might bring that about. His doctor told him that he could only control his actions and not the feelings of others. But the kind of person that Per wanted to be was the kind of person who elicited from other people predictable, good feelings.

Per checked his watch and saw that it was almost time for Anil to take his twenty. He did not want to be around when Anil took his twenty, so he went upstairs to check the carts for re-shelves. Anil went down the stairs and Per sighed. Clem, another bookseller, spotted him watching Anil and laughed.

‘He’s not so bad.’

Clem and Per had come at the same time. For a little while, Anil had tried to make a joke of their names: pears and clementines, fruit of the loom, fruit bowl, stuff like that. But the puns lacked the snappy cruelty of a good inside joke and fell out of use almost immediately. Clem had gone to school with Siva and Emmaline – Bard College. They each had grown up in different parts of New York. Clem in Hudson, Emmaline in Westchester, and Siva in Brooklyn. Per, like Anil, was from Alabama, though unlike Anil, Per was from a small town in Central Alabama whereas Anil had grown up in affluent Daphne, seven years later at that. Also, Anil went to Harvard and Per had gone to the University of Alabama in Huntsville to study aerospace engineering.

Sometimes, at night, Per liked to imagine the different trajectories they had each taken to get to this job in the bookstore at this particular moment in time. He assigned each of them a color and traced them with his fingers in the air.

‘I don’t think he’s bad,’ Per said. ‘I just don’t think he likes me.’

‘He likes you about as much as he likes anybody.’

‘That’s the problem.’

Imogen waved Clem over to take the register so she could help a pregnant woman find a book. One of the older shift leads, Barbara, was doing stock on the computer. Per pushed a small cart bearing books through the art section and tried to wedge a monograph of somewhat terrible black-and-white photography back into place.

The strain made his hand sting and he glanced at the bandaging and thought of Siva. The warmth of her hand on his. The way she’d touched the tip of her tongue to the corner of her mouth. It was nice, what she’d done. He should get her a gift. Something that said thank you, we live in the world together. That fact didn’t mean much to most people, but Per found it kind of miraculous. That of all the people who had ever lived, these people were alive at the same time as him. And he got to see them and be seen by them each day. How strange. It could have gone any other way. Really. There was an array of possibilities. Alternate lives. Routes. Choices.

But other people.

The cart had some poetry on it too, things picked up, read snickeringly and then set aside. Some people confused reading and literature – they supposed that these two things had a great deal to do with each other. This made for a lot of confusion because it prompted people to believe that reading was somehow the sort of behavior that was inherently good in a moral sense. When in fact the moral value assigned to reading had to do with the creation of the idea of literature, which some people imbued with all the solemnity of the holy when in fact it was a middlebrow bourgeois anachronism created in universities and retroactively applied to some of the greatest works of human history. In that way, reading and literature were the same. Yet in today’s world, reading had diverged even from these modest middlebrow origins and had sunk into some horribly populist activity.

A modern bookstore was perhaps the greatest example of this kind of fallacy. There were no true believers of this new religion, only empty-headed evangelists flogging the idea that all reading was good reading and that anything could count as reading, and anything could be literature, and that any reading was in fact reading literature and therefore morally unassailable, and in this way not merely morally good but also aesthetically good. There could never be a true faithful to such an empty string of logical transformations. Who could ever earnestly go on their knees in the quiet and the dark of their human soul and raise their face up and say to the vast and unknowable gods of that quiet inner darkness, Any reading is good reading.

Per did not read the books that were popular in the store where he worked because those books were books, not literature. They had very little to do with life and would not be read in five years. The books most popular in the store were popular precisely because of the hyper-localized nature of their idiom and the narrowness of their concerns. The books described a mode of life that would be utterly unrecognizable in a year or two. Or worse, they were about a generalized, abstracted version of the past that had been mostly cobbled out of quickly digested research articles and hazy family memories from across the diaspora. The contemporary novel as Per understood it was mostly about the self, but also about things that had happened to a family across many generations but also about Nazis but also about slavery but also about some obscure local historical atrocity that reverberated through to the present day and had shocking consequences for all involved but also about a painter on a train going to Prague and thinking about a bad man she had slept with once or thought about sleeping with anyway.

Unfortunately, Per was the kind of tiresome person who enjoyed Henry James and got emotional in the back of rideshares on his way to parties because he remembered the final words that Ralph Touchett says to Isabel Archer in The Portrait of a Lady:

‘And remember this,’ he continued, ‘that if you’ve been hated you’ve also been loved. Ah but, Isabel – adored!’

More than once, Per had gotten drunk at a party or a bar with his co-workers and tearfully explained that this was the most beautiful moment in all of English-language literature to which someone invariably responded, ‘Yes, but what about Sula?’ Per did not have a comeback in the moment. He always felt that Morrison’s poetic force was a different thing than James’s. And part of what made the moment with Ralph so powerful was that it was James resorting not to his flights of fancy or interiority, but simply letting the character say what he needed to say to the person he loved most in the world.

Per checked his watch. When it had been twenty minutes, he went back downstairs. The break room was empty. Anil’s jacket was gone and his apron hung in its place. He was probably smoking out in the alley even though they weren’t supposed to. Anil’s other preferred perch was up on the street near the restaurant where the girls were eating lunch. He could be such a pest. Per tried to take that thought back. To think of Anil in a good way. A kind way.

He put away the first-aid kit and checked the store email. There were some virtual orders he could pull. Some slips to fill. He was grateful for this small domain over which he reigned and for its hum of activity. Down here in the dark, amid the boxes and the rustling pages of books.

–
That night, after the shift, Per went out with some of his co-workers to the tapas bar across the street that had recently reopened after a long closure during the pandemic. Anil knew the owner because they had gone to college together at Harvard, which Anil did not like to tell people except when he was drunk and feeling self-pitying. He was happy, actually, that he worked in a bookstore because it proved how fake the whole infrastructure of the American meritocracy was, since he, the son of immigrants, could work his ass off and go to Harvard and still end up working in a bookstore across the street from a bar owned by his classmate who had skipped most of his classes to do coke and coasted on family money. It was fine, actually, so fine, totally fine, funny actually, that he had a Harvard diploma hanging in his parents’ house outside Birmingham, Alabama, and here he was in New York, selling copies of Glennon Doyle and Braiding Sweetgrass to stay in a studio apartment on Canal Street. There was something so beautiful in all of that.

Anil was already getting wound up, drinking mescal and recounting the days he and the owner of the bar had spent getting wasted and not going to PHIL 302 or whatever. The owner was skinny and a little short. He seemed not to know what to do with Anil’s little speeches except to stand good-naturedly by and refill his friend’s shot glass. He welcomed them all into the bar with a friendly, open air, and Per thought he seemed like a nice enough person, like nothing had seriously gone wrong in his life and so he had managed to reach adulthood with his capacity for kindness still intact.

Emmaline and Siva were talking among themselves at one end of the bar while Anil and Clem were at the other end talking to the owner, whose name Per now knew to be Chester. Per sat more or less in the middle with his glass of seltzer and lime. The bartender was tall and tan and he had a neck tattoo of some indecipherable creature that rose just above his starched collar. He was shaking margaritas for a table near the back wall. The tapas bar was elegant – marble and gold finishes. Everything was slender and sleek, polished. Running along the side wall was a black velvet banquette. In the summer and autumn and in good weather the windows opened out and up, creating a sense of al fresco.

They were in a decent part of SoHo, catty-corner to a church and a playground. In the springtime the trees were beautiful over the sidewalk, and in the dead of winter the church rose high, dark and solemn over the street, imbuing everything with a certain Graham Greene-like aura. It was unseasonably warm for November, and Chester had called for the front windows to be opened, so that the bar filled with the sound of cars from the street. It was a little after seven, the primal dark of late autumn, but it was strange, with it also being so warm, and Per had the sense of being out of time. There was a quality to the darkness in autumn, so different from the darkness of summer or spring, deeper, somehow, richer in tone and temperament. It came so quickly, autumn darkness, that by the time it was seven it seemed like midnight, even though there was still so much day left.

Anil shouted, ‘I just think it’s mad wild, bro, mad wild, that you own this place! How sick is that!’

Chester shrugged and poured more mescal into Anil’s glass. When he noticed Per watching, he winked.

‘Refill?’

‘No,’ Per said, now feeling a little embarrassed because he hadn’t even finished the seltzer he’d asked for.

‘Are you doing a sober thing?’

‘No,’ Per said. ‘I mean. I’m not sober. I mean. I don’t drink. But, like, not like, systematically.’

Chester blinked slowly, then he said, ‘That’s cool.’

‘Is it?’

This time, Chester flinched slightly, and Per wondered if he had been hostile. But then Chester smiled and nodded.

‘I’m eighteen months sober. Systematically.’

‘Oh wow,’ Per said. ‘Congratulations. Or. Not congratulations, that was probably rude.’

‘No,’ Chester said. He leaned on the counter and put his chin in his hands. ‘It’s nice. You’re the first person to properly congratulate me on it.’

‘Oh. Really?’

‘I mean, I don’t go around telling people. It’s bad for business.’

‘Then I won’t tell.’

‘I appreciate your discretion,’ Chester said. ‘Can I get you something else? It’s hurting my feelings the way you’re hoarding that seltzer and not drinking it.’

‘I’ll drink it.’

‘You don’t have to. We have other stuff.’

Chester leaned back and looked down into the space behind the counter. The bartender had just finished shaking out more drinks and stood awkwardly by while Chester inspected their stores.

‘Need something?’ he asked.

‘Just. Uh. Something for the, uh, chronically sober.’

‘Oh, we keep the chocolate milk in the back?’ the bartender said, pointing with his thumb to the swinging door. Chester stared at him coldly. Anil had stopped barking at the boys and looked their way. The girls too. Everyone was looking at the three of them, Chester and the bartender behind the bar and Per on the stool in the middle. He felt bad, like he was ruining the vibe in some way too subtle for him to really parse. So he gulped the seltzer down, and in doing this seemed to release everyone.

‘See. He’s fine,’ the bartender said.

Chester scraped his teeth across his lower lip and flexed his hands a couple of times like he needed to shake something out. Then he turned to Anil and lifted the bottle and said, ‘Don’t stop on my account.’

The bartender poured whiskey sours and took them to the other side of the bar near the girls from the bookstore. Chester watched him go.

‘Sorry,’ he said. ‘We’re . . . still getting back up to speed.’

‘It must have been very stressful, being closed.’

‘Yeah. Something like that.’

Chester leaned on the bar again. Anil and Clem had come to stand closer to Per.

‘I was telling them about how we used to skip class,’ Anil was saying, starting the story again.

‘They don’t need to hear that one again. Change the station.’

Anil frowned childishly, and truly seemed to be casting around in his mind for some other anecdote. It was kind of miraculous, this silence extracted from Anil. Clem laughed, which made the girls come back over too, and just like that, they had become a group again.

Chester watched over all of them, rather pleased, like a hen tucking its chicks under its wing.

‘How do you like working in the store?’

‘It’s great,’ Emmaline said. ‘Well. It’s a job.’

Siva laughed. ‘It’s more like a hobby.’

‘At this pay, what’s the difference?’ Clem asked.

‘Health insurance,’ they all said mordantly.

‘Technically,’ Anil started, ‘we probably shouldn’t even be talking to you. After all, we are labor.’ He drew a circle indicating himself and the other bookstore workers, then pointed at Chester. ‘And you are an owner. This is bad Marxism.’

‘What about the sheep lying down with the wolves?’ Chester asked. ‘Doesn’t Daddy Marx imagine some great future where we’ll all come together for the betterment of mankind?’

‘That’s MLK,’ Anil said. ‘Marx says we should put you against the wall.’ He made a gun with his fingers and stuck the barrel between Chester’s eyes. He smiled.

‘That’s Stalin,’ Clem said, putting his own finger gun to the base of Anil’s skull. Siva put her finger in Clem’s ear and whispered loudly, ‘Lenin.’

Emmaline rolled her eyes and put her finger under Siva’s chin and said, ‘Robespierre.’

They all groaned and extricated their fingers from each other’s soft spots. But before they’d broken up, that continuous chain of human connection had made Per shiver. In the light of the tapas bar, Emmaline’s blonde hair and soft eyes and Siva’s sharp brow and delicate black ponytail, Clem’s boyish pout and bony wrist, Anil’s luscious dark hair and vibrant eyes, and Chester’s good-natured blue gaze and placid expression – all of it had made him think of two paintings. The first by Goya, The Third of May 1808, and the second by Manet, The Execution of Emperor Maximilian. For the richness of the color, the delicate humanness of the expression, the surging dark undertone of the subtext and the roaring animal scream emitting from its subjects. It was a jolt, the image of them all linked up like that, pretending to murder and butcher each other at the first moment of rhetorical weakness. Not because he thought they would do it. But because they were capable of alluding to a world in which it was possible to murder one another. Even after they had taken their hands away, Anil’s finger remained between Chester’s eyes, and the others had stopped laughing.

‘Bang,’ Anil said. Chester kicked his head back as if he had been shot. Lolled back dramatically. But Anil wasn’t smiling. He turned to the rest of them and said, ‘Did I tell you guys how I used to skip class with this guy?’

–
They were entering prime tapas time, and people were starting to come into the bar in order to ruin their appetites. New York ran on such meals. The fast, the expedient, the readily consumed while drinking.

Anil asked for a table, which Chester obliged in giving them. Per sat between Siva and Clem. Emmaline and Anil were on the banquette. The music was loud. The street was a little busier now, the bar next door and the restaurant across the street next to the bookstore had their lights on and their windows and doors open.

Chester had a rabbit paella sent to the table.

‘It’s a new dish,’ he said. ‘We’re trying to expand our offerings. Be more of a small-plate situation.’

‘Paella isn’t small plate,’ Anil said.

Siva pinched him under the arm. ‘It looks so good.’

‘Let me know if you like it,’ Chester said. He was standing with his hands on the back of Per’s chair, and Per could feel his weight pushing down. When he left, his hand grazed Per’s shoulder. Clem was watching. Per focused on the paella. It was in one of those traditional pans, deep, flat on the bottom. They could hear, over the noise of the bar, the faint sizzling of the underside, the rice gone crispy and dark. The rabbit meat looked juicy and rich. Oil glinted on the rice and the meat. Per felt such a vicious desire to taste the food that his mouth hurt.

‘Check out Alabama Oliver Twist over here,’ Anil said. ‘You
look like you’ve never even seen food before. What’s your problem, robot man?’

‘Shut up,’ Clem said.

Per tried to manipulate his face into a neutral expression, but he did not know how to exactly. He hadn’t realized that he’d expressed something with his face, and now he understood that he had shown his hunger. It embarrassed him. His face was hot again. And his
neck hurt.

‘Oh,’ he said. ‘I’m not really hungry anyway.’

Anil laughed.

‘Seriously, man, shut up,’ Clem said. Emmaline put her hand on Per’s shoulder.

‘It’s okay, really, don’t worry about him.’

‘No, no, no, it’s fine. It’s funny. I’m fine.’

Anil reached across the table and slapped Per’s chest with the back of his hand, ‘Man, I’m fucking with you!’

But in doing so, he upset the dish and some of the oil in the pan lurched up its side and onto the table in front of Per. He jumped back, which made the dish lurch the other way, and lift briefly from the table. It returned with a loud clank. Per, having lost his balance, fell back in his chair and hit the floor, and the air whooshed out of his chest.

He lay there stunned, then, beneath the receding numbness, the burning arc of the chair back pressing into him, hurting. He groaned and tried to sit up, but the world grew dizzy, sloshy. And the others bent over him.

‘Are you okay?’ Siva asked.

Per turned his head to look at her. Tried to smile, but did not remember how exactly. The expression eluded him, and it was gone for so long that he thought he’d never smile again.

‘Oh my God,’ Emmaline. ‘I think he has a concussion.’

Clem was crouching by him. Emmaline too. Anil had got out of the banquette and was standing over him. Per felt hot. Flushed. The air was too thick, too heavy. He really wanted to taste that rabbit. He swallowed thickly and sat up.

‘I just need to catch my breath,’ he said. His back still hurt. Then, throbbing, the base of his skull. He reached back to feel for blood, but found none. Still, there was a deep, splitting pain back there. He’d have a knot in the morning. He tried to stand, but felt dizzy again.

The music had stopped, and people were looking at them.

‘Why did you freak out like that?’ Anil asked. ‘It was just some hot oil, man.’

Per stood and braced himself against the chair and tried to catch his breath.

‘Come with me,’ someone said. It was Chester. He had taken Per’s arm gently in hand and was pulling at him. ‘He’ll be all right, please, eat.’

Per took his coat and his bag and allowed himself to be pulled along, his steps heavy and plodding. They went through a side door and out of the restaurant. They were in a dark passageway.

‘Please,’ Chester said. ‘This way.’

The air in the passageway was cool and clear, and Per felt he could get his breath back. Still, he followed the pressure of Chester’s hand and they went to the back of a hall and then through another narrow door and slowly up some steps. And then they were in what looked like a stairwell.

‘Are you okay?’

‘Yes,’ Per said, nodding his head, but then the sharp pain made him stop. ‘I’m all right.’

Chester looked him over, which required Per to look down since he was taller.

‘My place is just up here,’ he said. There was an elevator, thankfully dimmer than the stairwell, and they rode upward in silence. ‘Sorry for being so presumptuous but you looked like you could use a breather.’

The apartment was spacious, there was that. It had big windows for walls and a central sitting area with the same lush velvet and slender metal finishings as the restaurant. Below them, the city. The trees and the churchyard, the bookstore, and the buildings of the bars and shops. People in the streets. The darkness tinted blue.

‘Sorry about Anil,’ Chester said. ‘Please, sit.’

Per did as he was instructed and sat, slowly, on the velvet chaise at the center of the room. The world had stopped spinning quite so much, but the pounding in his head was still going strong. It was in a counter-rhythm to his heartbeat, which made him woozy.

Chester gave him some aspirin and a cup of warm water.

‘It’s better warm, trust me.’

Chester stood anxiously over him while Per held the empty glass and stared down at the carpet.

‘Should I . . . take my shoes off ?’ Per asked.

‘No, you’re fine. Actually, if it’s not a hassle.’

Per laughed. Then he pulled his shoes off and set them neatly by the coffee table. Chester had already done the same, probably out of habit. And he’d been politely standing there while Per kept his shoes on, not saying anything.

‘Did something happen to your hand?’

Per looked back at the bandage.

‘Oh, yes. I cut myself with the box cutter earlier.’

‘Rough day,’ Chester said.

Per lifted his hand and examined it against the backdrop of the city. His throat was dry. For some reason, looking at his hand while his head hurt made him want to cry.

‘Can I lie down for a moment?’ Per asked.

‘Of course.’

Per turned on his side and curled up on the chaise. It smelled like cedar wood. He pressed his face against the velvet.

‘I’m sorry I made a loud noise in your bar. I wasn’t trying to be disruptive.’

‘You weren’t. It’s Anil.’

‘Why do you let him act that way to you?’

‘What way is that?’

Per had turned his head and could now see Chester watching him from the floor with an amused expression.

‘I think you know what I mean. He is mean to you. Did you do something to him?’

‘No,’ Chester said. ‘ Well. Yes, long ago, I did something awful to him.’

‘What?’

Chester sighed loudly. ‘Do you want some more water?’

‘No,’ Per said. ‘But can you tell me what you did?’

Chester leaned back on his hands and looked up. Per reached down and squeezed his foot. He was warm, this man, and firm. Chester looked at him, a little shocked, but then something softer came into his eyes.

‘He wanted me to love him in a way that I couldn’t. And I knew I couldn’t. But I slept with him anyway. For a long time.’

‘Oh, he’s gay,’ Per said.

‘Yes,’ Chester said, nodding. ‘But that’s not really what I did to make him this way.’ His face was red, and he was again looking away from Per. This time, out the window at the building across the street, into its open, golden window where two people sat at a small table making dinner.

‘What did you do?’ Per squeezed his foot firmly. Chester groaned.

‘Well, it made me so miserable, I went on a really bad coke bender and left him on a spring break trip to Aruba. Like. I left him there.’

‘Oh,’ Per said. ‘Oh wow.’

Chester nodded slowly, his foot switching back and forth so that his toe grazed the inside of Per’s palm.

‘The funny thing is, he was totally understanding. Like, when he came back, he just said, Okay. And I went to rehab.’ Chester closed his eyes tight and held still for a moment. His voice was cracked and raspy when he spoke again. ‘The funny thing is. You’re not going to believe this. But he wrote me letters. Not, like, sexy letters. But he wrote me these really funny letters. And at first, I really, really, really didn’t want to read them. I threw them away. But this one doc at the rehab saved them and about a week, two weeks in, he gives them to me. These letters. And I read them and they are so funny and earnest and I don’t know. Sometimes you just. Need to know someone out there is thinking of you, I guess.’

Per’s eyes got warm and he put his face against the velvet of the chaise again.

‘Do you feel that way sometimes?’

Per did not answer. He kept his face flat to the chaise and then he felt Chester’s hand against the nape of his neck and then the middle of his shoulders. He did not want Chester to see that his eyes were wet, but then he might ruin the velvet so he turned his head and Chester was looking down at him. He was on his knees, rubbing Per’s back.

‘Me too,’ Chester said, then he sat with his back to the chaise. ‘I’ll just sit here a while with you. If that’s okay.’

Per was not sure how long they sat there. Eventually, the pain in his head subsided. Some of the vividness returned to the world. And he was able to sit up. Then Chester joined him on the chaise and they sat there, Chester’s head tilted over the back of the sofa and Per trying to sit as upright as possible. Chester told him about Harvard and about rehab and about failing to stay sober and about Anil and about second rehab, this time in California. They talked for a little while, but then Per got dizzy and Chester’s phone kept buzzing. He excused himself to take the call in the bedroom and Per lay back down with his arm over his eyes, trying to quell the sense of whirring motion all around him.

He might have gone home, but the couple were eating dinner with some of their friends and would need the living room for most of the night. He might read in a cafe or go to another bar, maybe walk through the park since the weather was so warm.

‘I don’t think you can be left alone,’ Chester said. ‘I think you maybe ought to go to the hospital. You might be concussed.’

‘I’m okay,’ Per said. ‘I can just –’

But then it was clear to him that there was no place for him to go. Other people had places. Other people had other people. That was not a part of his fate. Per stood and walked to the window. His knees felt firmer than earlier, that was good.

‘You should just stay here,’ Chester said. ‘You can, you know. I don’t have to be downstairs. I can stay up here. Your friends have left.’

‘They aren’t my friends,’ Per said, but then, looking at the bandage Siva had wrapped around his hand, he felt guilty. ‘No, they are.’

‘Stay,’ Chester said. ‘And if you barf, we’ll go to Urgent Care.’

Per sat as he was told to sit. And he held his breath and waited to see if he felt like barfing. He didn’t. He felt heavy and slow, but absent the urge to void his stomach. Chester sat next to him.

‘The restaurant is busy tonight, but it’s okay. I’ve got my mobile command center. Are you feeling okay? Need some food? More water?’

‘More water, maybe?’ Per asked.

Chester got him another large glass of warm water, which Per enjoyed, to his surprise. He was Southern and therefore accustomed to cold water. Chester said the warmth helped digestion.

‘That makes sense,’ Per said. He leaned back and closed his eyes. Again, he was struck by the thought of the Goya painting, the ghostly yellow and white, the grimy brown bleeding in out of the dark. And again that image of all of them pointing their fingers at each other, a chain of violence terminating in Chester whose crime was being rich. He was scrolling his phone now, biting the edge of his thumb. Per watched, and then when Chester noticed, he looked at him openly.

It was a disarming expression, totally receptive, without any hostility at all.

‘Are all sober people like you?’

‘I hope not,’ Chester said.

‘It’s a little unnerving. Normally, I’m the one who unnerves people.’

‘Why is that?’

‘I’m,’ Per started. ‘I’m like. I mean, you notice how I am.’

‘No,’ Chester said. ‘Not really.’

‘I don’t always handle people well. Or they don’t handle me well. I find it hard to know what to say or do or to hide that I don’t know what to say or do.’

‘Oh,’ Chester said. ‘So you’re totally normal.’

Per prickled, looked away. In the corner of the room, a slender golden lamp with a spherical shade.

‘I don’t think that’s true. I don’t need it to be true. I’m just. Myself. And sometimes I can’t really. Mesh with people. They confuse me.’

‘I’m sorry. I was being glib. I didn’t mean it that way. I find it hard to speak to people sometimes without making a joke.’

Per’s doctor said that jokes were a way to relieve the repression of difficult things and to sublimate those things into pleasure. They were an attempt at mastery.

‘I’m bad at jokes,’ Per said.

‘Me too.’

‘No you’re not.’

‘I am.’

‘You’re so funny,’ Per said.

Chester’s face reddened again. ‘Yeah, whatever. Flattery, flattery.’

‘I mean, sure, but it’s true. You’re funny. I like your jokes.’

‘Have you even heard my jokes?’

‘In the bar, you said thank you for your discretion. I thought that was funny.’

‘You didn’t laugh.’

‘I did. Internally.’

Chester laughed. Per rested his head against the back of the settee. He wanted to close his eyes very badly, but he didn’t. Chester got in close and also leaned his head back. They were looking at each other. Chester lifted a hand up and touched the soft space under Per’s lower lip. The contact was warm, electric. They were not friends. They were not even really acquaintances. They were just two people in a room somewhere in the whole vast world of seemingly like temperament. They were leaning there looking at each other, now Chester touching Per’s lip with his rough thumb and their faces coming nearer. Per held his breath. Chester kissed him. A little bit of animal tenderness, and then Per’s lips opening and the slick warm wet of Chester’s tongue and then they were kissing fully.

But then the movement jostled Per’s head and the pain came back sudden and brutal, and he leaned forward and threw up between his knees.

–
At Urgent Care they sent him to the emergency room. Per lay in the bed on his side. His mouth was sour and his stomach was roiling. His head throbbed under the lights. The doctor had seen him and checked him over and thought he looked fine but definitely had a concussion and should schedule a follow-up with his proper doctor later in the week. In the meantime he needed observation. Chester told the doctor that he’d be on it.

Chester asked the doctor how long before Per could sleep, should he be allowed to shower, to drink, to watch TV, and more. He asked the doctor informed questions that made Per feel stupid and slow. Then, when he was discharged at three in the morning, they stood on the sidewalk. It had finally gotten cold. Chester got a car for them and Per leaned his head against the cool glass.

When they returned to Chester’s apartment, they were greeted by the smell of Per’s vomit. Chester wedged some windows open and stood by while Per showered. And then climbed sorely into bed. At each step, he insisted that he was fine. That he was okay. And at each step, Chester said that it was okay, he didn’t mind, not to worry. In the end, Chester got frustrated and held Per down and said, ‘Just let me be nice to you. Okay? You can pay me back later. Just relax.’

Per lay down. He thought about what his doctor would say. That not understanding why a person was doing something did not mean they were concealing some evil motive.

‘You have to learn to trust people, Per. Not everyone wants to hurt you.’

Under Chester’s blankets, Per turned to look at him. He reached out and took Chester’s hand and he said, ‘You aren’t trying to hurt me, are you?’

Chester laughed. ‘No, Per. No I’m not.’

    "text": "After being laid off from his factory that winter, my dad bought a used motorbike with his severance money and became the newest bike-taxi driver in the neighbourhood. Every morning, he would leave home at six, wipe down his bike with a bucket of hot water, place his helmet on the back seat, and join the group of other drivers who waited by our apartment building. It was hard to tell him apart from the others – they all wore beanies, parkas and leather kneepads. Each morning, before the first passenger showed up, my dad and the other drivers would hang out on the street corner. They would set up a metal paint bucket at the roadside, throw in some broken pieces of wood, pour in some gas, and light everything up. The flames always shot up into the cold air and coughed out smouldering embers. They would immediately huddle around the bucket, stomping their feet to keep themselves warm. Taking their hands out of their pockets, they would slowly extend their arms towards the flames, as if they were practising tai chi, before quickly wrapping their warm palms around their cheeks. At a distance, their morning gathering looked like the most miserable party in the world.

From then on, the first passengers would arrive. The drivers always took their time warming up the engines, before releasing the clutches and letting their bikes roll a short distance on the road. This time was needed to awaken their eyes – the waves of heat from the fire having melted the people and the buildings in the background into a dreamy blur. The cold winter gusts seemed to bring back the drivers’ spirits, and they would slowly twist the throttles forward as the world crystallised in front of their eyes.

The prices of the bike rides varied and depended entirely on negotiation. Typically, a passenger would announce their destination, and the driver would purse his lips, complain about how hard it’d be to get there, and ask for five yuan. The passenger would tell the driver to cut the crap because they’d only paid three yuan in the past. All right, three yuan, the driver would say with a reluctant look. I’ll give you a discount, but think of me when you need a ride next time, okay? The passenger would agree, hop on the bike and say, Don’t crash the bike, let’s get going.

Summer was the best season to be a bike-taxi driver, as there were always people who needed quick rides. And the drivers could ride their bikes at full speed. They got to watch the lush trees lining the streets rush by, as the cool summer wind raked their hair and massaged their arms beneath their sleeves. Winter was more difficult. There were fewer passengers, and drivers had to endure the freezing wind that slashed their faces and pierced through their bones. The streets were covered in black ice and became impossible to drive on. Motorbikes went down one after another next to piles of snow that didn’t melt for months.

 

My dad picked the wrong time to be born. The government sent him down to the countryside when he was a teenager, and his factory sent him packing when he had a family. He’d always tried to ride the tide of his time – all he wanted was to become one of the many who lived a good life in a promising nation; but by the time he figured out the right actions to take, the ship had already sailed. It took him a long time to realise that he would forever be stranded on the shore.

When he first became a bike-taxi driver, during the winter months, there were so few passengers that he ended up spending more time blowing his runny nose than riding his bike. He made about thirty yuan on a good day, but that number dropped to ten when luck wasn’t on his side. Things improved in the spring, after the Lunar New Year. The weather warmed up, and the demand for bike-taxi rides slowly increased. Most of my dad’s morning passengers were elementary- and middle-school kids who’d woken up late and didn’t have enough money to get a cab. My dad was there to take them to school just in time for the flag-raising ceremony. I watched him become happier each day – after several difficult months without alcohol or cigarettes, he was finally able to treat himself to a drink or half a pack of Hongmei at night.

My dad was busy during the week, but had little to do on Saturdays and Sundays, when most people preferred to take the bus or ride their bicycles rather than hail a bike-taxi. With his spare time, my dad dropped me off at my cram school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon. And while he was waiting for my lessons to end, he would usually play cards with his bike-taxi driver friends. On a good day, he could even win a few dimes. His friends thought I was going to piano lessons, until my dad told them about my maths and English teachers at the cram school. One friend asked him if I was falling behind at school. He’s fine, my dad said, Just learning some more advanced topics. His teachers at school organise the lessons, who knows what they’d think if we didn’t sign him up? Another friend said, That’s horseshit, his teachers just want more money. My dad shook his head and said, It’s a lot of money, and nobody has a damn clue if my son has learned anything useful. But what can we do about it? They didn’t force us to sign up. His friends told him to take it easy. It’s good that he’s taking English lessons, one of them said. He can go to college and become an interpreter for the government.

One afternoon, after two rounds of card games, my dad stood up to stretch his legs and have a quick smoke. Leaning on the backseat of his bike, he spotted a slender middle-aged man in a brown leather jacket, waving at him and his friends. The man’s back was hunched over, his eyes sunken, his lips dark, the skin on his face saggy. His keychain clanked beneath his belt as he walked towards my dad and the other drivers. Can anyone give me a ride to Wulihe? he hollered from a distance.

Most bike-taxi rides were shorter than ten minutes. Wulihe was on the other side of Qingnian Dajie Avenue, two districts and seventeen bus stops away, in the south of the city. This meant that every route to Wulihe passed through Nanba Road or Liangdong Bridge, both of which were police hotspots. And since, yes, bike-taxis were technically illegal – a driver could have their bike confiscated if they got caught by the police – most drivers simply refused to go near those two places.

My dad’s friends looked at each other – nobody answered the man. My dad said, Wulihe is so far away! How much would you pay?

The man asked how much my dad would charge. My dad thought about it and said, We might run into the police along the way. You’re paying at least twenty.

Twenty? I could pay five more and get a cab. Fifteen, take it or leave it. I’m in a hurry, and you bikers go real fast through the back alleys, I can count on you to get me there in time.

Fine, hop on, it’s not like I have another passenger anyway, my dad said, waving at him. Fifteen’s better than zero. You’re helping me pay for my son’s weekend lessons.

My dad rolled the throttle forward, and the motorbike merged onto the main road. Without turning around, my dad shouted back to the man, his voice carried away by the blasting wind, Dude, you better not throw me under the bus if we run into the police. I’m telling them we’re visiting an old friend together. I’ll be completely screwed if I lose my bike. I need to pay my family’s bills!

The man’s voice came from behind my dad, No need to worry, my man. We’ve got time to get to know each other and figure out what to say. I’m Xiao Shubin. I used to work in the flour factory cafeteria.

I used to work in the transformer factory, my dad said. Is the flour factory still doing okay?

Okay my ass! The factory’s made no flour for years, said Xiao Shubin.

It’s early afternoon on a weekend. Why are you going to Wulihe? my dad asked him.

Going to a football game. Shenyang Sealions’s first home game. I’m going to inspect it.

Inspect? So you’re one of those government higher-ups, my dad teased.

C’mon, man. Do I look like a higher-up? I’m inspecting my old co-workers. I worked in the Sealions cafeteria after the flour factory gave me the boot. I know the Sealions people very well, said Xiao Shubin.

Isn’t there a new goalie from South America on the team this year?

I hear you, man. You know ball. Yes, Miguel Miranda from Peru. I’m going to see if he’s any good.

He probably has really good vertical, my dad added.

Of course, South American players have flexible bodies. Think of René Higuita, the scorpion-kick guy, from Colombia. Look at how he dives, how he folds his body mid-air!

If I’m being honest, my dad commented, the Sealions need to be careful they don’t get relegated.

Relegation shouldn’t be a problem, but what kind of future do we have to look forward to if that’s all we care about? We aren’t playing to win, we’re playing to not lose. That’s why we live at the bottom of the league table, Xiao Shubin lamented.

My dad rode his motorbike very fast, as if he was riding the wind. In the rear-view mirrors, he saw Xiao Shubin sit up straight, his gaze level above my dad’s helmet. He watched out for road signs and mud puddles and directed my dad to the fastest routes down the steepest slopes. They drove through red lights, passed intercity buses, and went beneath bridges without running into the police. A few minutes before kick-off, they arrived at Wulihe stadium safe and sound.

Xiao Shubin hopped off the bike and took off the helmet. Standing in front of the stadium, he stared at the high concrete wall solemnly. A few wet strands of hair stuck on his scalp. He turned to my dad, paid for the ride, and handed him the helmet with both hands.

Why not join me for the game? he said to my dad.

Not today. I still need to pick up my son, but let’s go to a game together this year for sure. My dad nodded to him, before heading home.

That evening, after my dad and I got home from cram school, my dad parked his bike in the garage, dusted it with a dry towel, and headed to the neighbourhood store for a beer. I tagged along, and that was how I met Xiao Shubin. He was sitting on a stool in front of the store, picking his teeth. I thought he looked hideous – under the dim street light, his hair looked as if it had never been washed. He spotted my dad and greeted him. My dad asked how come he was back so early, to which he responded that someone had given him a ride. My dad asked him about the game. Xiao Shubin answered, Nil–nil, nothing exciting, but our goalie had a few crazy saves, it’s a shame you missed out. By the way, guess who else was at the game? China’s number one football fan, Rossi, the man who lost his job and family because of football. He was wearing that fucking cowboy hat and going bananas after every shot. It was just as you’d expect.

My dad changed the topic and asked him if he lived nearby. Xiao Shubin answered that he’d recently moved into the NE Pharm dorm across the street, and he’d come to the store to watch the sports news because he didn’t have a TV at home. My dad nodded and went into the store, grabbing two beers. When he came back, Xiao Shubin pointed his chin at me and asked, This your boy? My dad said yes. Xiao Shubin asked how old I was. Eleven, my dad answered for me. Xiao Shubin stared at me for half a minute, before suddenly raising the pitch of his voice and saying, Kid, why you got that briefcase under your arm? You love going to school, huh? My dad said that I’d just returned from cram school, and that I loved watching TV more than going to English lessons. Xiao Shubin responded, I also got a boy with me, he hated school, never did any homework, I sent his ass to a sports academy, now he’s the starting forward for the academy’s football team. My dad said, Your boy must be very good. He’s got a bright future. He’ll at least become the next Li Jinyu, and who knows how high his ceiling might be? Xiao Shubin said, But he’s short, he could use a few more centimetres, other than that, he’s got the best technique on the team. He can beat any defender, hands down.

 

In the next few months, Xiao Shubin took my dad’s bike to every Sealions game at Wulihe. There were a few times when he brought a long pole with a flag wrapped around it. Sitting on the back seat of the bike, he held the pole by his waist as if it were a spear. My dad always dropped him off in front of the stadium entrance. Xiao Shubin jumped off the bike, stood with his legs wide apart, and swung the flagpole with full force. As the flag opened in the wind, he began to slowly march into the stadium and sing the Sealions’ anthem. In his low, peculiar voice, he roared out the two lines of lyrics printed on the flag: We are the Sealions, breaking the waves! We are the Sealions, cruising ahead, cruising on!

It was a special time in Shenyang’s history – everyone was enthusiastic about football, and every company had a football fan club. My elementary school even took my class to a Sealions game. I told my dad about it, and he decided that he’d go to the game as well. When he next ran into Xiao Shubin, he said that he was going to the next game and offered him a free ride to the stadium. Xiao Shubin was ecstatic. Every time he saw my dad over the next few days, he reminded him to bring his lay-off certificate. One-yuan tickets in the laid-off worker section of the stadium, he said, his eyes beaming with excitement. My man, you gotta bring your certificate to the game. Unless you want to pay five for the same ticket?

The Sealions’ opponent that day was Shenzhen Ping’an. We took the lead in the first half, when our centre-back Chen Bo scored. Early in the second half, Shenzhen’s Li Weifeng evened the score with a header. It took the Sealions only a few minutes to respond – our Brazilian star striker Ribeiro tore apart Shenzhen’s defence and sent the ball into the back of the net. The packed stadium erupted in thunderous cheers, singing the team’s hype song in deafening unison. The section in front of us was occupied by cadets from the Artillery Academy. They kept their hats on their laps and sat in military posture, their green uniforms drenched in sweat. When the stadium wave reached their section, they stood up and sat down all at once, completely disrupting the flow. But the crowd was impressed by their synchronised movements and responded with cheers. The section across from us contained the biggest local fan club: an ocean of yellow Sealions jerseys, with a scattering of half-naked people, jumping up and down, beating drums, tossing confetti into the air. The west stand behind the goal was reserved for laid-off workers. It was the least crowded section. This was where my dad and a few other middle-aged men watched the game quietly. They were all dressed in dark clothes, and they either crossed their arms in front of them or kept their hands in their pockets. None of them talked to one another. They all remained standing, as if they were ready to head out at any moment. The exception was Xiao Shubin, who was waving his giant flag from kick-off to the final whistle, as if he were the captain of a lonely ship, breaking the waves, cruising ahead, cruising on.

After the game, Xiao Shubin found me and my dad and insisted on treating us to dinner. We went to a diner near the stadium. Xiao Shubin set down his flagpole against the wall, picked up the menu from the table, and asked me what I wanted. I said anything was fine. He ordered a pepper and tofu skin stir-fry, a pot of pork-bone stew with pickled cabbage, an offal wok-fry, and a spicy cucumber and cilantro salad with extra chilli oil. He then picked up the two small glasses on the table and went into the kitchen. When he returned, the glasses were filled with transparent liquor. He handed a glass to my dad and said, Try this. It’s made from green beans. It’s sweet and won’t give you a hangover.

Xiao Shubin was in great spirits. He waved his chopsticks in the air and began a long monologue about the Sealions, from their tactics and performance to his prediction for their next few games. His expertise was exhausted after two glasses of the green-bean liquor. My dad changed the subject and asked him if he lived with his family.

I’m divorced, don’t have custody, Xiao Shubin responded.

So you only need to take care of yourself. You can go to games and have a few drinks every day. Men dream of your life!

But I still have to pay child support. It’s expensive to have a boy who plays football. I’ve got almost nothing left of my buyout money.

Well, it doesn’t sound like you’re trying to get a job. There are always people looking for good cooks like you.

Exactly, my man, you know me well, Xiao Shubin grinned. I’ve breathed in too much cooking smoke in my life already. I deserve a break. If I cared enough to look for a job, then the other cooks in the neighbourhood would need to start worrying about getting fired. And you know who’d be the first one to go? The cook here. Just look at this plate of tofu skin on the table: where’s the meaty flavour? They forgot to add braising stock before velveting the dish with cornstarch. I’m giving the cook a D-minus.

You’re right, braising stock would’ve made a big difference. Anyway, one more beer, and then I should probably get going. My son has school tomorrow, my dad said, pointing at me.

Xiao Shubin took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and handed one to my dad.

Don’t be in such a hurry. It’s not like you’ve got things to do at home, he said, lighting up a smoke for himself. I’ve got a story for you. Remember the Three Stallions? The three North Korean players from a few years ago? They played so hard that they were bleeding at the end of every game. Do you remember them? I’m bringing them up because I was the Sealions’ team chef when they first arrived. They’d just left North Korea, and probably hadn’t had any meat for a while, so I cooked a pork knuckle for them. I’m very good at cooking pork knuckle. You deep-fry it, then braise it with soy sauce and sugar – you need both to add colour to the meat – then you steam it, and finally, you glaze it with the braising juice. I’ve never met anyone who said no to my pork knuckle. Anyway, back to the Three Stallions. I’ll never forget the look on their faces when I set the pork knuckle down in front of them. They couldn’t pull their eyes away. It was like they were staring at a pile of gold coins. They each grabbed their chopsticks, picked up a large chunk of meat, and stuffed it into their mouths. Oil dripped from the pork skin dangling between their lips. You’d worry the dish was too fatty, but it wasn’t a problem for them at all. From that day on, all they ate were my pork knuckles, three meals a day, no vegetables, only pork knuckles and steamed flour buns. The Stallion named Lee was in tears after that first meal. He grabbed my arm and babbled in Korean for ten minutes. Of course I had no idea what he said, so I patted him on his shoulder and said, Okay okay, okay, good, I gotchu man. Go play hard on the field, and you can eat all the pork knuckles you want. But two weeks later, they suddenly stopped eating pork knuckles and refused to touch any meat on
their plates.

Sounds like they’d had too many pork knuckles, my dad said.

It came out of nowhere, Xiao Shubin continued. The coach was worried they weren’t eating enough. He asked me for help, so I went to the Korean neighbourhood in Xita and brought back a few jars of gochujang. That was all it took to solve the problem. For the next few weeks, three meals a day, all they ate was rice with gochujang, so spicy that their lips puffed up. But they trained and played as hard as usual. Well, of course they were fine – they’d lived on the North Korean diet before! By the way, there’s one more thing about the Three Stallions I haven’t told anyone. There was a supervisor who’d come with them from North Korea. He was an old man in his fifties, looked harmless, spoke fluent Chinese. He was like a political commissar. He oversaw every minute of their lives outside football. What did he do? He made them watch North Korean patriotic war movies every night in their dorm. And what did he have to do with me? I got fired by the Sealions because of him! Let me tell you what happened. So, Mr Supervisor and I got to know each other pretty well. It was a few months after the Three Stallions had joined the Sealions, there was one evening, the players were having a film session, and Mr Supervisor came to the kitchen through the back door. We went outside, had a few smokes, and talked for a long time. I told him my boy was also playing football, and he said he could get the Three Stallions to train my boy. I asked him, Wouldn’t that get you in trouble? And he answered, I’m their supervisor, I get to decide everything they do. I was very happy to hear that, I brought my boy to the team facility the next day.
The Three Stallions trained my boy really well, and I couldn’t have been happier.

Xiao Shubin took a sip of his drink and resumed. That evening, when I was going to sleep, bam, bam, someone was banging on my door. It was Mr Supervisor. I put on a jacket and followed him outside. He turned to me and gave me a wink and said, It’s too early to go to sleep. Why not show me around? I was like, You know what time it is? All the shops are closed. He said he wasn’t interested in shops and gave me another wink. The wink made me uneasy, and I asked him what on earth he meant. He winked at me again, and started teasing me. He mimicked the way I always made boned chicken jokes at the lunch table. Ah, so Mr Supervisor wants me to get him a hooker, I realised, finally clocking what his winks were about. Well, how could I say no? My boy needed his help to get into the youth academy of a pro team. But I know now that what I did that night was stupid. I took him to a random massage parlour down the street. I wanted to go back to sleep. I was too lazy to take him to a good spa across the city. Anyway, we went into the massage parlour. The boss lady turned on the pink light, and there were about half a dozen girls lying on couches. The boss said, Pick any girl you like, and Mr Supervisor made himself at home. He was touching the girls’ thighs and flipping their bodies around as if he were at a fish stall. He was taking his time. I got annoyed and said, C’mon man, they’re all the same. Keep your eyes shut, and you’re boning Maggie Cheung. He finally made up his mind and picked a girl. He took her by the waist, and they went into the back room. Two minutes later, just after he’d taken off his pants, the police suddenly stormed in. Damn it, we’re screwed, I thought. Well, it was a police trap, but what could I do about it? Mr Supervisor pretended he knew no Chinese and roared in Korean, but it was no use. The police handcuffed us and took us to the police station. The next afternoon, the Sealions sent someone to pick us up. I went into the team office, and my boss told me I was fired. Damn it. But you know what was funny? They told me I was fired because I’d harmed the friendship between China and North Korea!

Xiao Shubin was so excited by now that he was completely oblivious to my dad’s displeased look. All right, my dad said, waving his hand at him, That’s enough for today. No need to go into all that detail in front of my son.

 

Two weeks later, on a weekday afternoon, I saw Xiao Shubin again. When I got home after school, he was having a drink with my dad on the balcony. He was sitting sideways, and his face and neck were completely red.

A gold ring this fucking big. Why did I just give it to him? My boy only got fifteen more minutes of playing time! he cried, waving his bottle, spit flying out of his mouth.

But what can you do? Football’s an expensive sport, my dad said.

Xiao Shubin put his hands behind his head and let out a deep sigh. This fucking coach, all he cares about is money! There’s nothing else I can do, really. What else can I do?

Yeah, you’re absolutely right. But who else isn’t going through something like this? I also have to deal with my son’s teachers, my dad said, taking a sip of his drink. Times are tough for everyone. But things will get better soon. I’m sure you’ll figure it out.

Xiao Shubin cast a quick glance at me and said, Your boy is back. I should probably get going, time for him to do homework. My dad told him to stop by any time. Before Xiao Shubin headed out, he smiled to me and said, Kid, I got you some snacks. I put them in your room. My dad made me say thank you. Xiao Shubin said, Keep up the good work. Don’t disappoint your dad.

My dad and I stood behind the door and listened to Xiao Shubin drag his feet downstairs, his slippers slapping the ground. It took him a long time to reach the ground floor, as if he were mulling over his next move with each step he took.

I asked what had brought Xiao Shubin to our home. He needs money, my dad said. He’s got nothing left in the bank to give his son, I couldn’t kick him out.

I suddenly remembered that I’d seen Xiao Shubin’s son just a few days ago by the NE Pharm dorm. He was talking to his dad, I said.

My dad took a sip of his drink and asked me what they’d been up to. I told him I wasn’t sure, but that in the end I saw Xiao Shubin’s son suddenly kick Xiao Shubin in the back of the leg.

And then? my dad asked me, a surprised look on his face.

I don’t know if his knee buckled, but he bent down to clutch his leg. And he kept talking to his son from the floor, with his hand still on his leg. I don’t remember seeing him stand back up.

My dad appeared lost in thought for a moment. At last he said, His son is probably just another sports student with a bad temper. I wouldn’t worry about it too much. Now, go to your room and do your homework.

Xiao Shubin picked the wrong time to visit my family. My mum had been having sleeping problems for a few weeks. She would wake after just a few hours of sleep, and from then on all she did for the rest of the night was stare at the ceiling in the dark. During the day, she could not stop yawning, and had no energy to do her work. After two weeks, she started having migraines. She had to massage her throbbing temples every few minutes. The migraines worsened until one evening, when she was in so much pain that she couldn’t even get herself out of bed, my dad rushed her to the hospital. After a night of scans and tests, we were handed a diagnosis none of us were prepared for: there was a tumour in her brain that could only be removed with a craniotomy.

It was a huge blow. My dad’s work as a bike-taxi driver would not be enough to cover the expenses. From that day, he continued to leave home early in the morning, but instead of joining his bike-taxi friends by the road, he headed to our relatives’ homes and asked them for money. After signing a bunch of IOUs and getting some additional help from friends, he managed to raise enough money, and my mum’s craniotomy was scheduled for a few days later. During the surgery, my dad and I waited outside the operating room. We stood there for a long time, until my dad handed me his parka and told me to take a nap on the plastic bench. I couldn’t fall asleep, so I kept my eyes open and stared at the doors to the operating room. Doctors and nurses went in and out through them, speaking to patients’ families in low voices. Their murmurs echoed in the empty hallway, like the quiet, tumultuous buzz of radio or insects.

My dad paced anxiously through the hallway, going to the balcony for cigarette after cigarette. He was in the middle of one when my mum’s surgery ended. The nurses wheeled her out of the operating room and looked for him, but he was nowhere. The air in the hallway was cold, so I took over from the nurses and pushed my mum’s bed towards the elevator. It was heavier than I’d expected, and one of the wheels was broken. The liquid in the IV bottle kept sloshing around. When I reached the elevator, my trembling arms lost control of the bed. The rails hit the metal door with a loud bang – my mum’s head jerked to the side. That was when my dad finally appeared, reeking of tobacco. I turned away from him and punched the ground-floor button. The moment the elevator doors closed, all I wanted to do was kick him hard in the back of his legs and watch him grab his knees in pain.

It took a few days for my mum’s vision to recover after the surgery. Her world was coated in a layer of fog – she needed someone to take care of her. My dad parked his bike in the garage, brought a camp bed to the hospital, and moved into my mum’s room. I went to the hospital after school to help out, and support my mum in regaining her coordination. My dad and I picked up food from the hospital cafeteria and ate dinner together by my mum’s bed. At night, we took turns sleeping on the camp bed.

One evening after dinner, I was doing homework and listening to the news on the radio. The announcer reported, Local communities can finally rest easy as three men from Changchun have been arrested for connections with the Pao-ben Gang . . .

Who are the Pao-ben Gang? I asked my dad.

They hit you on the back of your head with an axe.

Why would they do that?

To rob you. People are desperate for money. If you get hit, you should pray you die on the spot. Otherwise, you’ll end up in a coma and never wake up again.

I should mention another thing that happened during our time at the hospital. One afternoon, Xiao Shubin came to see us, carrying one plastic bag of apples and another of bananas. We were all surprised by his sudden visit. He was wearing his old slippers, and his white shirt looked unusually baggy on him – he’d lost a lot of weight. He found himself a plastic stool and sat uncomfortably on it, casting furtive glances around the room before fixing his eyes on the floor. He began a long rant about the medical system, but nothing he said made any sense. It seemed like he was more concerned with finding a place to rest his hands.

It didn’t take him too long to run out of conversation topics. How’s our sister doing? he asked my dad, referring to my mum.

She’s doing fine, she’ll be good to go home in a few days.

Nice, nice. Does her health insurance cover everything?

No, just a little bit. We have to pay a lot out of our own pocket.

That’s exactly what the hospital wants! Do you know how much you’re paying for things that have nothing to do with her recovery?

But what can we do about it? my dad said. Have you been looking for work?

I have, my man, but I haven’t had any luck. You know what happened? Every restaurant and diner I went to, they said my dishes don’t look elegant. Elegant, what the hell does that mean? It means nobody wants my cafeteria food any more.

Take it easy. You’ve got this, my dad said, to comfort him. Have you been to a football game recently?

Oh, hell yeah. Nothing can stop me from going to the games. But it’s been rough. The Sealions are at the bottom of the league table. Here we go again, playing to not get relegated. Damn it, what were all those expensive international signings for?

Before Xiao Shubin headed out, he took out a fifty-yuan bill from his pocket and tucked it under my mum’s pillow. My dad tried to push his hands away and said, Please don’t do that, dude. I appreciate you, but I can’t take your money.

It’s nothing much, but I want to help. Our sister had a big surgery, she should eat well, Xiao Shubin said, insisting that my dad accept the money. My dad had no choice but to put the bill in his pocket.

My dad headed out with him to send him off. As they were walking downstairs, Xiao Shubin turned to my dad and said, My man, there’s one thing I’ve been thinking about. I wanted to get your thoughts.

Don’t beat around the bush. Just ask if you need help.

If you don’t need your bike in the next three days, any chance I can borrow it? I’m trying to go to another game and take my boy on a day trip.

My dad was reluctant but agreed. Fine, it’s not like I need it in the next few days anyway.

Only three days, I promise. I’ll bring it back with a full tank of gas and without a single scratch, Xiao Shubin said.

The next morning, my mum was cleared to go home. My dad packed her bags and went to the hospital pharmacy to get her prescription. I grabbed our bowls and went to the cafeteria to get lunch. When I passed through the ground-floor lobby, I was caught in a crowd of doctors, nurses and patients. The healthy ones among them were running outside through the front doors, followed by the others who were moving more slowly, dragging their legs. All of them had uneasy looks on their faces. Before I understood what was happening, I too found myself standing outside.

A light drizzle made the humid summer day feel hotter. Raindrops fell to the ground only to evaporate without leaving a stain. I followed other people’s gazes and looked across the street. Dark clouds of smoke billowed above the trees, bringing flames and sparks that flashed and crackled like lightning. Beneath the clouds of smoke was the large metal frame of a trolley bus. Steam rose from the vehicle, carrying screams of horror and despair. I looked around – everyone’s eyes were fixed on the bus as the disaster unfolded.

By the time the fire trucks arrived, the heat radiating from the burning vehicle had evaporated the puddles of rainwater from the surrounding asphalt. The wind had blown smoke across the street, causing the people around me to cough. The screams and cries inside the trolley bus had by then quietened down. The clouds in the sky had thickened, and the light drizzle had become a downpour. But the crowd didn’t disperse. People continued to watch the burning bus, as if they had been trapped out there in the rain.

The evening news reported that the poles of the trolley bus had disconnected from the overhead wires and fallen against the high-voltage cable. The pole ropes had then caught on fire, and the current collector, mounted on the trolley’s roof, had turned red from the heat. Nobody was aware of what had happened, however, until the bus pulled into the next station. Six passengers stepped from the bus and were immediately electrocuted. They collapsed on the ground, their charred bodies lined up in a row as if waiting for another bus. I thought about the crowd in front of the hospital. People around me had been standing on their toes, trying their best to get a look at the bones protruding from the victims’ burnt skin. I remember hearing people count the bodies, one, two, three, four. And as smoke was blown across the street from the bus, those people simply wiped the tears off their eyes and resumed their count, one, two, three, four, five.

 

Three days passed. My dad was still waiting for Xiao Shubin to return his motorbike. He was ready to get back on the road now that my mum had returned from the hospital. He went to the NE Pharm dorm, but Xiao Shubin and the bike were nowhere to be found. None of us was prepared for this. It seemed as if Xiao Shubin had vanished from the world. My mum was too sick to lash out at my dad. All she could do was lie in bed and sigh.

My dad was in complete denial. He came up with every possible excuse for Xiao Shubin: a traffic accident, a personal emergency, a scratch on the bike, an incident involving the police. He needed to convince himself that sometime in the next few days, his bike would miraculously reappear in the garage, completely intact, with a full tank of gas, and without a single grain of dust on the surface. But miracles don’t happen in my family, and the bike never reappeared. A week later, he finally accepted the truth: that he had trusted the wrong person. Without the bike, and without a way to make money, he locked himself away at home and sullenly paced on the balcony. I heard him murmuring to himself, Why the hell did I trust him? I didn’t even know him. I’d only had drinks with him twice!

Summer came to an end. I entered sixth grade and began studying for the entrance exams for the city’s magnet schools. One evening, after finishing another practice test, I was looking for my study guides, only to find them on top of the washing machine. Someone has moved them around, I thought. I’d always kept the study guides in my briefcase. It was made of artificial leather, with zippers on the top and handles on the side. The words celebrating forty years of the shenyang transformer factory were printed on the bottom-right corner – my dad got it from his factory. It was a spacious briefcase, and I took it with me to my cram school every weekend.

My dad came home later that evening, completely drunk, with a gloomy look on his face. He was holding the briefcase under his arm. It looked much more worn than before, and something long and bulky was protruding from inside, causing white stretchmarks to form on the leather. I was upset that he’d gone out drinking again. He ignored me, went straight to his room, and hid the briefcase in the back corner of the closet. Something doesn’t feel right, I thought. I need to find out what’s going on. When he wasn’t paying attention, I went to his room and pretended to look for my jacket. I reached my hands into the closet – my fingers touched something sharp. A metallic edge sliced my skin through the leather. I remembered what he’d told me about the Pao-ben Gang.

The next morning, my dad left home very early and went on a new search for Xiao Shubin and the motorbike. Relying on his hangover-impaired memory, he found his way to the sports academy that Xiao Shubin’s son attended. He roamed in front of the academy and examined every motorbike parked by the gate. Another thirty minutes of playing time for his son, he said to himself, touching the back seat of another bike that was not his. His search was fruitless, but he did learn one thing from his visit to the sports academy: not every kid in the academy was tall and strong, there would always be those who fell behind. He watched them run slowly on the track, swinging their noodle arms and dragging their legs in pain, and perhaps those boys reminded him of me. Then he found himself on the other side of the school gate, continuing his search for the bike behind the classroom building and inside the garage. The security guard stopped him and asked who he was. He ran away in the direction of the school wall without uttering a word, holding the briefcase tightly under his arm. The guard chased after him but soon stopped. My dad climbed over the school wall and escaped safely. He kept running, until he finally collapsed on the ground out of exhaustion.

His search continued the next day. He left home early in the morning and headed to the NE Pharm dorm. He knocked on the front door of the apartment building, in the morning, in the afternoon, after sunset and at midnight. No one answered. He sat on the front steps under the doorway and waited, holding the briefcase tightly under his arm, smoking cigarette after cigarette. His back was smeared with lime wash from the wall, and cigarette butts were piled up in front of his feet. Residents of the building ran into him when they went to work in the morning, only to see him again when they returned home at night. Everyone greeted him with a look of suspicion and disgust. No one told him anything helpful.

The search continued for weeks, and it completely sucked the life out of him. His eyes became dull, and everything he wore looked as if it were hanging on a skeleton. The only thing that didn’t change was the briefcase, which he took with him every day. I worried, every time I saw it, that at any moment he might take out the sharp, metallic edge.

One evening, when I got home from school, I found my dad sitting in the kitchen by himself, staring listlessly at the drink in his glass. When he finally remembered to take a sip, he gestured me to come over to him and said, One–nil.

What do you mean? I asked.

The second-to-last round of the season, the Sealions versus Shandong Luneng Taishan. One–nil. We won. We did it. We aren’t getting relegated.

I asked if he’d gone to watch the game in Wulihe, and he nodded. Was Mr Xiao there? He shook his head. How about the bike? He shook his head again.

That’s enough, Dad, I said. You’ve tried hard enough, now it’s time to stop.

I just don’t get it, he said suddenly, raising his voice.

What do you not get?

He took another sip of his drink and fell silent again. It took me many years to understand what was on his mind: How can anyone simply give up something they’re so deeply in love with?

 

The final game day of the season was in the last week of October. As my dad had said, the Sealions were safe from relegation, regardless of the result of the last game. That morning, my dad suddenly asked me if I wanted to go to the game with him. I wasn’t particularly interested, but I wanted to make him happy. We went to Wulihe by bus, and I slept the entire ride. The bus dropped us off in front of the stadium at around noon, hours ahead of kick-off. My dad took me to the ticket office.

Two regular tickets, he said. I looked at him in surprise. That day, he never took out his lay-off certificate.

No one else had arrived when we took our seats. A large shadow had moved from the east balcony to the west balcony by the time the game finally started. We had a great view, but the game was boring. The players strolled around the field for ninety minutes, and the head referee checked his watch after every pass. The stadium was mostly empty. Needless to say, the score was nil–nil.

The game ended around sunset. My dad and I needed to go home and make dinner, so we hurried out of the stadium and boarded the first trolley bus. The bus was packed with Sealions fans wearing the yellow jerseys. I was squeezed into a corner, my face pressed against the window. The old vehicle was nearing the end of its life – after the incident that summer, the city government had ordered all trolley buses to be retired by the end of the year. The giant beast we were on was too old to move fast on the streets. Dragging the two poles above its head, it shuddered beneath bridges and through tunnels, as the cold wind seeped through the cracks of its doors and windows. We drove past diners, karaoke bars and spas. A few small stores by the streets were under renovation, with fresh heaps of dirt piled up before their front steps. My dad clenched the handrail and quietly stood behind me.

It had rained earlier in the day, and the air remained cold and damp. Our trolley bus stopped frequently. It began to wobble and bounce as it moved along the muddy road beneath Liangdong Bridge, as if we were driving on a trampoline. Above us, cargo trains from the north carrying steel and timber haphazardly covered by tarps slowly crossed the bridge. The deafening sound of train wheels vibrated on the tracks and echoed powerfully in the tunnel, as if the bridge was about to collapse. I let my mind be swallowed by thunderous noise, and I looked out the window – a familiar figure was standing by the tunnel wall. It was Xiao Shubin.

He was wearing a white headlamp and a thin jacket, and the cigarette between his lips shivered in the cold weather. I couldn’t tell what was on his mind from the strange look on his face. Next to him, my dad’s motorbike was leaning against the wall. The October wind swirled in the tunnel, the city’s lowest point, blowing garbage, rainwater and fallen leaves into the air. He spotted our trolley bus and suddenly stopped shivering. His hands reached for his giant flag, and he began waving it with full force, as if he were a commander, calling his troops to battle.

I knew my dad had also caught sight of him and the bike. But neither of us said anything or looked back. The bus quietly moved past Xiao Shubin, before coming to a sudden stop. The passengers behind us fell against our backs, like waves crashing on the beach.

Other people in the bus had also spotted Xiao Shubin and his flag. One Sealions fan began singing the team anthem. Another fan joined him, then another, and another, and another, and many more. Their synchronised voices echoed in the bus like a sacred prayer: We are the Sealions, breaking the waves! We are the Sealions, cruising ahead, cruising on! Shenyang’s sisters and brothers, we’re always by your side! Arm in arm, hand in hand, we march ahead, march on!

The singing came to an end as our bus pulled into the next stop. Many passengers got off, and just a few got on. The bus was no longer crowded. The remaining passengers got off one after another before my dad and me. When we arrived at the final stop, the rain had started again.

The next day, my dad went to the central heating company and found a job. He knew nothing about pipelines and had to learn everything from the beginning. He emptied his briefcase and refilled it with pencils and stacks of paper. Unfortunately, he only kept his job for less than a year, before losing it again. He bounced around a few different jobs, then, and learned many more things from the beginning. Until, suddenly, it was time for him to retire. He’d become too old to land a long-term job. He’d become old before I was prepared for it – those difficult years went by much faster than I’d expected.

There’s one thing I’ve never told my dad: that winter, I ran into Xiao Shubin’s son many times near the NE Pharm dorm. He had a medium build and pale skin, and I thought he was very handsome. He looked only a few years older than I was, but he already had a girlfriend. They seemed very close and had already moved in together. He had probably left his football team by then. If I’d never heard about him, I’d never have been able to tell that he’d been, once upon a time, the star striker at a sports academy. Each time I saw him, he was wearing a long down jacket and holding his girlfriend around her waist. I remember spotting them everywhere near the NE Pharm dorm, from the back alleys to the railway bridge, from the farmers’ market to the neighbourhood park. Sometimes he held a cabbage in his hand, sometimes she had a plastic bag of instant noodles hanging from her fingers, other times neither of them carried anything. His girlfriend was very skinny. She always wore heavy make-up and tight black leather pants, and put her bleached hair up in a high ponytail. One time I ran into her when she was on her own. It was snowing heavily, and she was walking with her head down, taking small and uneven steps, shivering in an old sweater decorated with plastic beads that were no longer shiny. She grasped her collar tightly, pursed her lips and squinted. A sudden gust of wind blew the snow on the trees into the air. A few snowflakes landed on her fake eyelashes. At that moment, I thought she was the prettiest person in the world."

    "text": "When the injection took hold and the drilling started, he began to dissociate. He was no longer himself but merely a dental patient. The events that led to this moment need not be dwelt on. One afternoon during quarantine, there was a tectonic shift in the lower left posterior region of his gums. Disturbing yes, but nothing loose, nothing unfixed. There was, periodically, pain. He self-medicated. All of these alarming private phenomena were unaddressed, ignored, denied, but never entirely forgotten. Like many things, they were put off. A year passed and then another and then another. Sometimes his mouth reminded him of the Acropolis, once glorious and now crumbling, but in no danger of annihilation.

One morning in Tirana he woke up full of hope. He had finished a pile of work. Money was coming in. He was a free man in the world. Then, while he was eating lunch, the top of one of his molars went its own way. Around midnight it capsized, and he placed the tiny shard of himself in his pocket, the little one on the right side of his corduroys that he used for small precious things. That night he got lost coming home. The cab drivers kept taking him to the wrong street, one that sounded like the one where he was living. It was a hazard of being in a place where you only knew the words for ‘thank you’, ‘yes’, and ‘cheers’. He should never have left New York City.

He woke up on Saturday morning. His appointment with the dentist, made the previous day with the assistance of his friend E, his main informant and guide to the country, was on Monday. Her boyfriend, a novelist he thought of as the Martin Amis of Albania, had assured him that the dentists here were expert, reliable, and non-exploitative when it came to their fees. His social obligations for the weekend vanished. His hope dwindled. He edited somebody’s short story. He read somebody’s novel. He went to the movies. On Monday afternoon he went to see Dr L.

‘You haven’t been to the dentist in a long time,’ she said. ‘Are you frightened of me?’

‘Have you seen the film Marathon Man?’ he asked.

‘I haven’t,’ she said. ‘What happens in it?’

‘A Nazi dentist tortures a long-distance runner in an attempt to recover stolen diamonds.’

He had never possessed a diamond, stolen or otherwise. She examined his teeth.

‘Mostly good,’ she said.

‘Really?’ he said. ‘I thought I would have to have all my teeth knocked out and replaced, like the Hollywood producers told William Holden’s character in Picnic.’

‘No, that won’t be necessary,’ said Dr L. ‘No Hollywood for you.’

‘I would need my hair replaced, too,’ he said.

‘Very true,’ she said. ‘There will be some fillings and a couple of root canals and of course the extraction. There is a lot of tartar buildup in the vicinity of the salivary glands.’

‘You mean the geography of the mouth is a cause of tooth decay?’

‘The cause of tooth decay is the human body itself,’ she said. ‘Have you not visited the dentist recently because of the American crisis of masculinity?’

‘It’s just very expensive there, and I’m a freelancer.’

Dr L began scraping his teeth. ‘Tell me if it’s painful,’ she said.

‘It’s not painful,’ he said. Then he spit blood into a drain next to his chair. Dr L used a foot pedal to operate a fountain from which he filled a plastic cup to rinse his mouth.

As the cleaning continued, he felt shelves of residue fall loose from the pillars in his mouth. He felt sensations in zones where he hadn’t thought sensations were possible. He contemplated all the time that had passed since he’d had his mouth wide open with another person scraping inside it while another held a vacuum tube to suck up his spit. He had fallen in love, had his heart broken, moved to England, and returned, had his heart broken again, and again. The heart was something that healed, but the best you could do with a broken tooth was to keep it in your pocket. His youth had not been misspent, exactly, but it was gone. Above all, he had written many book reviews.

‘Do you smoke?’ Dr L asked.

‘How could you tell?’ he replied.

She continued her work. ‘Do you feel pain?’ she asked.

‘I never feel pain,’ he said. ‘I don’t believe in suffering. It has no meaning. How long have you been a dentist?’

‘Three years,’ she said. ‘Before that I was six years in school, since I was eighteen.’

‘When did you know you wanted to be a dentist?’

‘Since I was twelve,’ she said. ‘I didn’t know it would be so difficult.’

‘Did you have to learn a lot about chemistry?’ he asked.

‘I know the chemical reactions,’ she said.

He spit out more blood. He became aware of the radio playing. ‘This is a funny song,’ he said. The song was ‘Gangsta’s Paradise’ by Coolio.

‘One of my favorites,’ Dr L said. ‘All done today. Let’s make you another appointment. Are you free tomorrow?’

‘Yes.’

‘Come back at the same time.’

‘OK, how much do I owe you?’

She typed a number on a calculator. He wasn’t sure what currency she meant. He pulled out a wad of cash.

‘Oh no,’ she said. ‘Only twenty euros. This isn’t America.’

‘Faleminderit,’ he said.

 

He went to a cafe, one of a chain that seemed to have a spot on every other block in the city. He ordered a peanut caramel latte, took a seat at a table on the sidewalk, and lit a cigarette. He had never had that sort of drink before, but he wanted to taste something and he liked peanuts. The taste was odd. The cigarette was excellent. They were all excellent but this one was better than usual. His mouth was full of novel sensations, not entirely unpleasant. The drink and the smoke seemed to be entering his system through his newly raw gums.

He walked home passing the dwelling of Mother Teresa’s family on Kavaja Street, where the mother and sister of the saint once lived. He went to bed early. When he woke up he took a biography of Enver Hoxha to the cafe across the street. It was a catalogue of disgrace, infamy, and salacious tittle-tattle. When Hoxha was a schoolboy, his classmates called him the ‘donkey’. Aspersions were cast on Hoxha’s sexuality. He was said to have seduced the glamorous wives and daughters of powerful men or to have been a secret homosexual. There was no proof that he had written articles he claimed to have contributed to revolutionary periodicals while studying agriculture in France. Those who knew Hoxha in his youth thought of him as a talentless nobody, not even a committed partisan, just a cashier at a tobacco shop, but then, they said, it was always such nonentities who seized power in the end and wielded it brutally. Hoxha’s official birthday was the same as his, 16 October, but the biographer said he made it up and was more likely born in the springtime. The biographer, E told the dental patient, was a television presenter who could be categorized as ‘an Albanian Wolf Blitzer’. The opening pages detailed Hoxha’s death, of natural causes, at age seventy-six, in 1985, after surviving a lifetime of assassination attempts. How many of his teeth did he have left?

He went to join the Californian, a foreign correspondent visiting from Skopje, for lunch at the cafe outside the Opera House. She was entertaining an invitation from a man at the next table over to his family’s home in the countryside. The dental patient ordered a cheeseburger. It was the worst cheeseburger he’d ever had. He only ate half of it. He went home and brushed his teeth and returned to the offices of Dr L.

‘Do your gums hurt?’ she asked.

‘No,’ he said. ‘You are an excellent dentist. Have you won any awards?’

‘Not yet,’ she said. ‘Today after some additional cleaning, we will do some fillings. I will administer an anesthetic to half your mouth and you won’t feel any pain, unlike yesterday.’

She spent twenty minutes renewing her efforts at scraping, then pressed her fingers on his lower front teeth. ‘All the tartar and plaque caused you to lose some bone around these teeth, but they’re not loose, so it’s OK.’

The prospect of ‘losing some bone’ alarmed him, but soon the needle was in his mouth, piercing his flesh and seemingly making a deep journey into his jaw. He felt the lower right part of his face disappear. He heard the sound of the drill. It sounded like she was playing a musical instrument capable of producing only a single irritating note.

‘First, I will drill away the decay,’ she said. ‘Then I will apply a binding agent to the tooth. Then I will fill the hole and my assistant will shine a UV light on it, causing it to harden immediately. Then I will use the drill again to shape the new teeth.’

‘What is the material of the filling?’ he slurred, his mouth half asleep.

‘It is plastic and something else,’ she said. ‘I don’t know the English for the other thing.’

When she said ‘plastic’, it sounded like ‘plastique’, and he thought of Semtex in his mouth, something that one day might explode, not merely crumble.

‘You should,’ she said, ‘try to avoid swallowing because you don’t want to choke on this stuff.’

As the drilling continued, he focused on breathing through his nose and suppressing any impulse to swallow. Dr L and her assistant wore paper masks over their mouths and plastic masks over the rest of their faces. He tried not to look into their eyes. He sensed that his tongue was making involuntary spasmodic movements, like a modern dancer with an experimental choreographer whose work was destined not to stand the test of time. He grunted in order to request a chance to spit. The women’s heads and hands floated away from his mouth and he spat in the drain.

‘Sorry,’ he said.

‘It’s OK,’ Dr L said. This exchange occurred dozens of times during his ongoing acquaintance with Dr L.

‘What’s your favorite part of being a dentist?’ he asked. ‘Is it the drilling?’

‘No,’ she said, ‘the drilling is not my favorite. What I like is building the new teeth.’

‘You’re like an architect.’

‘Yes, I am.’

Back in the waiting room, he paid her €80 for the two fillings. Then they discussed the extraction. Dr L explained that there were two options for repairing the zone of the missing molar. He could get a bridge, which would cost €300 and require the removal of the molar in front of the one that had cracked along with the molar behind it, and whose roots she would soon extract. Or he could get an implant, a two-part process that would cost €600 and would not involve the gratuitous demolition of any of his teeth.

‘What do you think is better?’ he asked. ‘I trust you.’

‘The implant is the best solution,’ Dr L said.

‘Then that’s what we’ll do,’ he said.

He looked at the wall and saw a poster for children, a jumble of cartoon teeth with bright flowers growing from them and the surrounding gums.

‘Are the flowers that grow out on the teeth a sign of health?’ he asked.

‘Yes,’ said Dr L.

He told her he would see her next week after he visited Prizren for the documentary film festival. She told him to visit the castle there because it was beautiful.

 

He and the Californian met the next morning at the international bus station. The ride to Prizren across the border into Kosovo would take four hours on a new highway that cut through the Accursed Mountains.

They had been told the festival would render Prizren cosmopolitan and hedonistic. They got their bearings at Bar Hemingway – there was always a Bar Hemingway – and checked into their respective rooms. Everyone he knew in Albania had come to Prizren for the festival. He and the Californian went to a Danish film about teenagers in Moscow who were unhappy. They walked out after twenty minutes. She thought it was neoliberal propaganda. He thought it was boring, though it was nice to be able to smoke in the outdoor theater. They got a drink and then went to meet their Kosovar friends, M and V, for dinner.

The dental patient enjoyed the stuffed peppers, which weren’t too hard on his tender teeth. After dinner they went to the bar. A few rounds in, a large party arrived, among them an acquaintance of M and V’s, the deputy foreign minister for diaspora affairs. She was accompanied by her boss, the prime minister. M, V, and the Californian were excited to meet him. The dental patient was embarrassed to be meeting a head of state, even an only partially recognized one, whose name he didn’t already know. The prime minister was friendly and happy to meet an American literary critic. They chatted briefly about Ismail Kadare. The prime minister was in the habit of giving Chronicle in Stone to visiting foreign dignitaries. It was not among the several novels of Kadare’s that the dental patient had read, another embarrassment. The mood was very festive and pictures were taken, but soon M and V had to drive back to Pristina. They said goodbye and the dental patient promised to visit them in America. The Californian kissed him goodnight and went back to the hotel.

At the bar, a Polish filmmaker invited him to a rave. He walked with the filmmaker and his friends along the riverside until they reached the rave and were issued wristbands. The music was loud and the dental patient recalled why he hated raves. He left and walked along the riverside, looking up the wooded mountain slope at the illuminated fortress of Prizren, and returned to the bar. It was last call. A few of the crowd around the prime minister remained. They invited him to join them at ‘the secret bar’. They snaked down the hill into an alley and entered an establishment with a neon sign that read secret bar. He bought a round of drinks. When he finished his Fernet, he walked back to the hotel and went to bed.

The next morning he and the Californian hired a driver to take them a couple of hours to Mitrovica. The bridge that led to the Serbian side of the river was guarded by a squadron of Italian carabinieri. It was quiet on the other side. D, a friend of the Californian’s from Skopje, met them and drove them to a restaurant by a lake where they ate a large fish. The lake was emerald green and surrounded by steep wooded hills. D talked about the war. He’d worked for an agency that was meant to save children but wasn’t doing a very good job of it, so he quit. Now in a ‘post-conflict society’, there were too many roadblocks, which were upsetting, but nor were there enough military-age men for another war. The young men were all abroad, seeking their fortunes.

The next day was Sunday, and he spent it reading his ex-girlfriend’s new book. The writing was wonderful, but there was so much about the online world, something he didn’t believe in. His phone rang, which was a surprise. It was a call from New York City.

‘Christian?’ the familiar voice of an old man said. ‘It’s Gordon Lish.’

‘Gordon,’ he said, ‘I can barely hear you. This is a bad connection.’

‘Where are you?’

‘I’m in Kosovo.’

‘What the fuck are you doing there?’

‘I’m at a documentary film festival.’

‘Jesus Christ, man, don’t be a hero.’

‘The war is over.’

‘Don’t be a hero, Jesus Christ.’

‘It’s fine. I’ll call you when I’m back in New York in a couple of months.’

 

He did not make it to the castle. Two days later in Tirana he was back in the chair at Dr L’s office. It was the day of the extraction of the roots. The roots, she explained, had separated from each other years ago.

‘As a dentist,’ he asked, ‘are you very self-conscious when you eat?’

‘Eating is not so much a problem,’ she said, ‘but when I am in that chair, all I can think of is complications. Students can only think of the complications that might happen, even though they happen less than one percent of the time. It has a name, something like student’s syndrome.’

‘You’re all hypochondriacs?’ he said.

‘We just know the worst that can happen,’ she said. ‘Don’t worry, today you will feel no pain. If you do, I will give you a second injection.’ And she plunged the needle into the lower left rear of his mouth. She pulled out her pliers. She pulled out her wrench. His tongue again danced. She pulled out her hammer. She put the hammer in his mouth and knocked around. She pulled the hammer out of his mouth. Now it was a bloody hammer. He grunted and slurred and she delivered the second injection. Once more with the pliers. She said, ‘There, I have it!’ And he looked up at the long bloody yellow remains of his vanished youth."

    "text": "By eight, the guests are all on the second garden deck, clinging to their drinks as to the edge of a swimming pool after a long day of laps. The men have established themselves about the place.

In the kitchen Lettie had encouraged Maeve to boss her around, but Maeve said that was precisely why she left the restaurant business. Its brutal intensity. Its sadistic efficiency. It’s like with cows, she told Lettie – you can taste the pre-slaughter adrenaline in the food if it’s come from a stressy, stratified kitchen. Maeve had no real authority figure growing up, so she could never get used to having one in her workspace, let alone being one. Besides, in the rest of her life, she’s impulsive and a bit frantic . . . but she’s chill at the chopping board. The trickier the dish, the more it centres her. Nah, Lettie’d said, stress is the pressure I make diamonds from. No pressure, no diamonds. Her teeth had shone. She’s adapting to the lack of pressure now, though, telling Maeve about her daughter while rapidly laying out the miniature bowls and plates for the first courses. Her sense of humour is legit! she says. Like, last night I asked her: what’s your favourite dish? And there was this epic pause, and then she shouts: Bowl!

Lettie laughs at her own story, and Maeve is spellbound. What a gorgeous, precious thing you have.

She’s ace.

Don’t ever let her leave, Maeve says.

Lettie catches her own pride in the silver serving platter she’s wiping the edge of. Love her. The dirty little prick.

Oh, they’re gross, aren’t they? Maeve says. The Q-tips! The tampons! Toothpaste spit in the sink! Towels covered in bronzer! And that sharp fart smell of singed hair.

With mild disavowal, Lettie says, Thank God Ella loves her skin. And her ’fro.

Maeve’s eyes go to Lettie’s never-idle hands. Wow. What a brilliant thing to be able to say. Go her.

You have daughters? No, I . . .

You want one?

Maeve squints. I thought you said you like her?

Lettie laughs and glances at the clock. I mean kids.

’Cause I, too, have commitment issues but that was pretty quick to offer her up! Like: Take her!

So you want one, or what?

Ah, Maeve says. Maybe. Yeah. I’m . . . I have sisters. She fiddles with the canapes, which are already spaced perfectly and ready to go. They always licked their plates, so I could never tell which ones were clean . . .

You mean –

. . . or if it hadn’t been enough.

– little sisters?

Not anymore. We’re all adults, we keep telling each other. But I’m not sure I’m responsible enough to have –

Oh my days! Lettie is peering out to the patio. Mrs Charles just put out nuts.

What? Maeve goes to the window, to situate herself in the moment. To remind herself of the participants, that a meal is something communal. It’s not a one-way tender. But the kitchen is lit up like a showroom, blinding her to anything outside of it. She points to the canapes, tells Lettie, These can go down now, and – if you can – collect the nuts. Or don’t bother. It’s their party. This is red mullet with anchovy-rosemary sauce on a cabbage leaf – a fancy fish taco. Gluten-free. This is Welsh rabbit terrine on prune and cardamom sourdough from Bristol. And for the vegetarians: kale and cauliflower tots made with almond flour; and the pastry is English mushroom and dark ale from Staffordshire Brewery.

Yes, Chef! The gold hoop earrings brush off Lettie’s cheeks.

After another twenty minutes of preparation – minutes that are squeezed for every second – Maeve makes her appearance at the long table to announce the menu. Even as she addresses the company, she is rehearsing for the cutting, piercing, brushing, layering, reducing, resetting, pouring, piping, grating, turning, drizzling, shaving, dusting, whipping, enrobing, adjusting, placing, plating choreography of her hands, which will commence the second she’s back upstairs. They all pay her their full attention, with a sort of bovine curiosity and gastrological suspense.

We’ll open, she says, with an amuse-bouche: a celeriac medallion with a puree of Swiss chard and truffles from Dorset. We’ll follow with a classic vichyssoise. Our primo will be native lobster from the Cornish waters, in ravioli with saffron and pinot blanc foam, and sturgeon caviar . . . in place of salmon roe, which would have had to come from Alaska . . . For our vegetarians, we’ll have canal-side nettle and ground elder ravioli in butter and sherry. Our main plate will be roast Nottingham partridge in a chestnut and cassava nest, with a cider and caramelised onion gravy, served with a smoked beetroot and tarragon salad. For the vegetarians, the same chestnut-cassava nest will be full of Brussels sprout ‘eggs’ with runny Red Leicester yolks! At this, the party breaks into chatter – amused to the hilt with this egg proxy; relieved to have moved on from the non-native roe. Maeve continues over the din as Lettie arrives with the celeriac dish, on a tray borrowed from the restaurant. Pudding, Maeve says, glancing at Lettie, who’d instructed her not to say dessert, will be a mascarpone semifreddo with a fig and crab apple compote with flaked Kentish cobnuts! Finally, I look forward to taking all your complaints over cheese and sweet wine also from Kent. Enjoy, folks.

A smattering of gemstone-protective applause, a few knee slaps, a wager won on the absence of chocolate (cocoa beans don’t grow in Britain), and a factless spat about the origins of cassava. There’s no music, Maeve notes, but then it’s not her party.

In the kitchen, her eyes never leave the food except to give instructions when Lettie can’t sense what to do next: when to turn something; when to dress it. Maeve works surgically, intent on livening the food at a precise point in the future: it must revivify the moment it meets the palate, not a second sooner. She moves along each plate, tapping a strict cluster of sturgeon roe on each, reminding herself perversely of rationing; there was a cherry tomato pasta she’d make as a teen, but she could only use two tomatoes per sister, because the punnet contained a dozen and the next day’s lunch could use the spare four.

Lettie trails her with lobster leg garnishes. This is extra, Lettie says. Next time I read Ella Hansel and Gretel them bread crumbs is getting upgraded.

Temperature control being a challenge, Maeve removes her apron and they both serve. All it takes is the costume alteration for her to become invisible at the party: the conversation doesn’t pause to receive them. One man barely leans aside to make way for his plate as he bitches about his friend’s son. (And he marches to the wine bucket, extracts the bottle like . . . King Arthur’s sword, and cries: That bottle was not to be opened; it was for studying!) At the dietary-restriction end of the table, Tony Blair is the subject of conversation. These ladies do make way for the plates, smiling graciously. Tony’s one big mistake was going into property too soon, a lady says. You must always wait a significant amount of time, because – she hushes – the people don’t like it.

I blame the wife! declares an elderly lady with a baritone voice; not a vegetarian. Maeve keeps her eyes down so as not to invite interaction. I blame the wife, because she’s greedy!

En route back to the kitchen, Mrs Charles catches Maeve by the aura and whisperingly suggests she get Lettie to call Beverly. If she turns up quickly, it would relieve you both.

I think she’s already on her way, Maeve lies, doubting that Beverly can afford to skip whatever she’s busy with.

Oh good. In the meantime – Mrs Charles still has Maeve by the air – perhaps Lettie could fetch more wine from the cellar. I’m afraid to step away and let this go chilly.

 

–

 

Night has foregrounded itself by the time Maeve is seated. The firelight gives the winter air a formaldehyde quality – pointed incisors and pocket squares and ivory brooches float around in the glow. Wood burns neat orange in a glass cube at the table’s end. A six-foot flue carries the fumes beyond them. The tabletop firestones are set to maximum. Set between the flames are cheese platters, each with three cheeses; a tiny jar and spoon; a block of pale jelly; a dish of oat-thyme thins; and lightly candied walnuts.

Joining the party at last, Maeve feels herself subject to the eerie glow too. A placid Irish specimen. Relieved not to be at the head of the table, she is congratulated on all sides: What a performance! Well done! Mrs Charles, seated beside her, pivots her body to Maeve to prompt some sort of speech. A man at the other end of the table asks her to stand if she intends to speak, he’s hard of hearing. Oh, Henry! the hostess responds, she’s been on her feet for hours. Do let’s be considerate. Maeve demurs and stands, feeling a crackling ache already where her cheeks meet her ears.

Thank you, everyone . . . for sending nothing back to the kitchen! And to the Charleses for inviting me, and to Lettie, without whose help the meal would have ended with soup. She’s a Michelin star in the making. Lettie smiles sweeter than the wine she’s pouring. The pearls on her earrings hang over the flames as snowflakes that won’t melt.

Now. If I told you that one of these cheeses is vegan, Maeve says, could you guess which?

An elderly man pats his breast for spectacles, and a few people exclaim, Oh my! Goodness, really? What? I missed that. Some lean in for a closer look. Some cut tidy corners and enact scrutiny on their forks. Watch your cuff, Benjamin, you’ll singe it!

What does that mean, vegan cheese? asks a lady who’d had no query about amuse-bouche. Her neighbour privately explains the concept of food that isn’t animals.

I . . . I . . . I know what this is! says a shiny-faced man with a peeled-plum mouth. One cheese is one of the cheeses is not in fact cheese but cake. When you cut it!

It’ll be the Wensleydale, Sir Charles announces from the other end of the table, having tried the other two and now balancing the Wensleydale on his knife as plainly inedible. What is it, then? Tofu?

Ghastly! A lady seated beyond the rampart of men now scowls at the Wensleydale.

No. Maeve shakes her head. No tofu anywhere, I promise. Fermented cashews, yes. If you’d like to try them, the pear jelly should go with the Roquefort, nothing with the Wensleydale, and there’s a Tydeman’s Late Orange apple mostarda for the hard cheese.

Lord Howard Gillies, the alleged raconteur – seated opposite Sir Charles and exchanging beleaguered glances with him – addresses the company: I’ve never heard the word vegan uttered from anywhere other than a high horse. You’re not about to make us all feel miserable, Ms Flattery, are you?

Maeve, who has her eyes closed to savour the blue-blooded Roquefort, opens them and turns to Lord Gillies. He doesn’t face her. He doesn’t need anyone to reply, only to receive his assertions. I’m not a vegan chef, Maeve says, but London has some fabulous ones. There’s a place in Bethnal Green called –

What I cannot fathom – Lord Gillies says in lieu of shut up! – is why one would eschew the real thing for an imitation. We don’t have cocoa trees in Britain, I’ll grant you. But we do have plenitudinous heifers.

Quite right.

We bloody well do!

– a few million in commission still, I hope?

In my experience, Maeve says, all or nothing doesn’t make for great cooking. And it’s my job to expand people’s –

Your cooking is fine, Ms Flattery. But cheese isn’t cooking. Cheese is cheese. And if it isn’t, it isn’t. It’s a compromise.

Now, now, Jeremy, Mrs Charles says lightly.

The French melt it and call that cooking, a lady says.

I hope it’s OK to point out, Maeve says in one go, that it doesn’t come out of the udders as cheese! Cheese is made. If we food makers don’t challenge ourselves to improve and perfect new alternatives, excellent alternatives won’t exist. They’ll be just compromises, as you say.

Whereas what we’ve got here is excellent compromise.

Maeve’s head ducks back, as if to avoid a tomato thrown at her. She scans her end of the table, but it’s a lot of ladies’ wrists and people staring into their crystal port glasses, waiting for the queen’s face to ghost forth and reassert the food chain. Maeve asks the party lightly: Does my food taste of compromise?

The I-blame-the-wife elderly lady declares boomingly: There you have it, Ms Flattery! The proof is in the pudding, which is capital. To Mrs Charles, she says: Petulance shan’t sour it. (Her expression reads: try lending your husband the other side of the bed to get out of on the morrow.) What of it if our Wensleydalean friends have been pooh-poohed this evening? Even Turner saw fit to denude North Yorkshire of its cow pats.

The Roquefort’s also vegan, Maeve says gamely. It took me eight weeks to make it, on my boat. But the hard cheese is goat.

Gasps and gollys meet this information. Someone by the name of Clement, as the proprietor of five thousand acres of idyllic North Yorkshire moorland, takes offence. Another man’s eyes dart to Maeve’s breast for a sign of plumpness, as if she might have nursed the Roquefort into existence herself. The dominant expression is one of bamboozlement.

Well, you had me fooled, says one of Mrs Charles’s friends seated nearby. It’s delectable, and just right with the pear.

Mrs Charles uses this positive beat to inform the guests that Maeve and her three sisters are all doctors! Maeve’s degree is honorary, so she’s coy about it, but the others are de jure and I just think, how wondrous – four female doctors in one Irish family. I mean, it’s highly unusual! Your parents must be so proud!

Maeve bites into a cracker so she won’t be expected to hold forth. Various conversations rouse along the table: honour being an indefatigable subject. Though he speaks at a moderate volume now, Maeve can make out Lord Howard Gillies telling his audience that it’s like his new neighbour in Suffolk, a certain Jay Lee. (The monosyllables are given as if they are not phonetic.) The Baron of Cowdenknowes or some such Scottish purlieu. He bought his feudal title at an auction!

No matter how she tries to steer away from personal questions, the ladies surrounding Maeve want to know her story. They must expect it’s very different from theirs, and seemingly it doesn’t end badly, so they’re inclined to hear it. When did she first know herself to be a chef; what are her aspirations; is she aware that she has an admirer in the MP Sir David Anderson? Though she doesn’t really want to, Maeve is tired, so it’s easier just to tell them:

When their parents died, she explains, she was thirteen years old. Her younger sister, Nell, was nearly twelve; her older sisters, Rhona and Olwen, were fifteen and seventeen. Various relatives moved in and out, looking after them in shifts. This angered and confused the girls, who resisted management, who preferred unsupervised sadness. Their parents hadn’t been typically parental. So when Olwen turned eighteen, she became their legal guardian. Funereal lasagne and shepherd’s pies and gooey casseroles arrived by the bucketload for the deep freeze, but Nell was already a vegetarian and Maeve said the microwave made everything taste of cabbage. They made a pact: if Maeve would agree to be her sisters’ dinner-lady, she would never have to strip a bedsheet or clean a toilet bowl again. (She would also become the grocery shopper, which came with the dilemma of what to spend when her older sisters weren’t being open about how much they had. Envelopes would drop from extended family like overripe fruit with no predictable season. To eat this one, or hold onto it?) The four of them got along best when each did her own thing, then came together for intense, dizzy judgements of one another, of their various lives. Well, the three others liked it that way, and Maeve put up with that fact.

Most days, to prolong their being hysterically, bickeringly together, Maeve made them all three-course meals. It had seemed like magic, sprinkling grated ginger and chilli onto honey-roasted squash for the first time, prompting Olwen to go droopy in pleasure and Rhona to clasp her raging throat and hiss words like public liability insurance. Olwen had got special dispensation to do the first year of her degree part-time, so she could stay with them, while she drove back and forth to Galway once or twice a week. By the time Olwen had earned an MA scholarship, Nell was nearly seventeen. She assured her older sisters that she was ready to move, to let the house be sold, as Rhona – ever mercenary – had proposed. So Maeve had known very early on that she’d work with food. But after culinary school, she learned that restaurant kitchens – with their aversion to the chaos and happenstance she so enjoyed – wouldn’t suit her. Several years in enough Dublin and London kitchens to count as a sample settled that. The very last restaurant where she’d been head chef was run by such uninspired, micromanaging pedants that, when she arranged for a leftovers charity pickup after a particularly wasteful New Year’s banquet, she was fired. They’d cited food safety standards, to which she’d replied that, as far as she knew, food was safer than no food.

Despite its relative precariousness – she tells the Ladies now – she doesn’t mind her freelancing setup. The catering keeps her learning. Her subscribers keep her passionate; they’re a sort of family. Besides occasional bursts of income, her followers also gifted her the opportunity to write books. Which is a really amazing thing, she says. And then, she hears herself revealing: And maybe the reason it’s going wrong now is because the opportunity came to me, rather than me seeking it out . . . which means the relationship with the publisher to begin with had a totally different kind of . . . love, and power dynamic. But . . . well, now we’re struggling to agree on a direction. And it seems I’m not the one who gets to lay down the bread crumbs.

The women are, ever so subtly, swaying; travelling in some sort of carriage, separate to Maeve’s train entirely. They observe her across the tracks, through several windows. One lady holds her head, dizzied by this disturbing sequence of images. Another reasserts her cashmere shawl, a shade of blue she has had lamentably described to her as ‘baby’.

When the first verbal response to Maeve’s outpouring is an appalled inquiry into the nature of her parents’ tragic deaths, Maeve dabs her mouth with the wrong side of a napkin and excuses herself to help Lettie with the coffee."

    "text": "Everywhere J traveled in the country with the government press attaché, people would turn to the attaché and say, ‘But you should explain the background to him, after all he’s not from here.’

One day, exasperated, J said to the attaché, ‘Will you tell me why people keep acting this way with me? Do they sense something about how I walk? My clothes? My accent hasn’t changed at all since I left.’

The attaché smiled. ‘But they know you live abroad.’

J, an internationally syndicated columnist, had been invited by the government to write a report about the country’s progress.

‘But does that mean,’ J said, ‘does that mean I’ve lost my connection to the country, that I’m not capable of understanding it? After all, I’m from here. I grew up here. In fact, that’s why the government invited me back for this work.’

The attaché said, ‘That’s a good point,’ though he clearly didn’t believe that.

J couldn’t let it go. ‘Millions of our people live abroad. Is this how you want them to feel?’

‘But there are certain things, sir, only a local –’ The attaché held his tongue.

‘But that’s what I’m saying. What is this magical thing I don’t understand? OK, fine: I’m not aware of the name of the latest cricketer or whatever sidey politician is in charge of this district. But why is that even important? This obsession with proper nouns – that’s not wisdom. As far as I can tell, the basics of the place – the corruption, the pettiness – have not changed.’

‘It seems like you have decided on the content of your report, sir,’ the attaché mused.

‘This habit of putting people in categories. Inside, outside; upstairs, downstairs. And as far as you’re concerned, I’m outside. How could I – some foreigner with zero connection to this place – possibly understand anything about this great country? Why even invite me to make a report?’

‘No, sir, it’s so you can understand,’ the attaché said.

J was beginning to comprehend the attaché’s humor. ‘You think this, all this that I’m saying, it’s proof of being a foreigner,’ J said, ‘getting bent out of shape like this –’

‘Not in the slightest, sir,’ the attaché said, but J could swear he saw his eyes twinkling.

‘OK, let’s continue on our tour,’ J said.

But as they drove around the city, J got angrier. He remembered now why he’d left in the first place: the people of this poor hot country were smug when they had nothing to be smug about. They were petty and possessive.

I’ll write the damn report, he thought. And it’ll be damn negative.

 

In the middle of the night, when the attaché was asleep, he received a call.

‘I knew it!’ the voice on the other end was shouting. ‘I knew it! They don’t say this to foreign journalists, only to people like me who left!’

After getting his bearings, the attaché said sleepily, ‘Perhaps they feel you’ve outgrown our little country, sir.’

‘No, no, no, not at all! They’re angry. Angry that I got away from this place. They want to pull me down!’

‘The visit is arousing feelings for you, sir,’ the attaché said.

‘All you bloody people are!’

Then the phone was slammed down.

 

‘Who was that?’ the attaché’s wife asked.

‘Some foreign journalist.’

‘Oh,’ she said.

‘But he grew up here,’ the attaché said.

‘Ooof,’ she said.

‘And he’s angry people don’t treat him like he’s from here.’

‘He might be the first person I’ve heard of who wants to be from here,’ she said.

They both snickered.

‘Goodnight,’ he said.

‘Goodnight,’ she said.

Then, suddenly, the attaché got up. ‘Is that really what you think of our country?’"

    "text": "The farm was in one of the fourteen green-purple wet deserts, in a dent six miles wide with its shoulders covered in scree and a rainy season that lasts twelve months a year. Always acid in the water, always vinegar in the ground. It’s a hanging land known for its lakes but we live in its hills. Cloudeaten mountains named fells. None of it is tall but all of it is steep and the slopes are topped with dwarf grass and soil thin as tea stains.

We raise our flocks on the sides of cliffs and teach each sheep to clear its plate – took them five thousand years, but they did it. Left nowt but bare rock, soaked black, and learnt to love the taste of moss. Everything fell down to the floor of Curdale Valley, back when meadows had wildflowers, and there it was flat enough to sell your sheep. Some folk decided to stay and build a village called Bewrith. It was a market at first, then they got at the coal under the fells, and then the slate, and when that was gone, it was where offcomers came to eat ham and chips on their way through to postcard country.

It’s all in Cumbria. The valley and the village and the farm. A made-up county with the border of England and Scotland to its north, though fitting into neither so well. Yorkshire and Northumberland to its east with the ridge of the Pennines keeping us safe from their inbred eyes. The Irish Sea to the west and the Isle of Man if you’re wanting a swim. Then to the south there’s the South and that’s never far enough away. People in the fells are as friendly as any that can be found. So friendly, they’ll spot your house up by a rock face and make sure theirs is built far enough away you can’t spot them back. Miles of nowt makes thick walls.

 

I don’t get into the village much now, and less back then, some thirty years ago. It never changes. It’s got two wet-dash pubs, one painted white and the other yellow, and that’s one pub for every twenty houses, and the homes are built of slate, jagged to look at, and the bricks are green on dry days and grey every other. The people in Bewrith, all two hundred-odd, they’d tell you all they had was the view and that was fine by them. All that’s needed to keep going would take care of itself since folk watched out for each other. Take your washing in if it starts mizzling, get the sandbags stacked when it’s flooding, keep an eye on your nan or your kids or your bloody wife. Keep their eye on you. More than one way to watch out for someone. Got to know when they’re ready to boil over so you can keep your boots dry.

That’s my way of introducing you to William Herne. The only one of us anyone wants to hear about. A sheep farmer. When people get talking about him – it’s always what a mad old bastard he was, like we saw him walking about with thieving and killing in him and just took shy at asking him to stop. But that wasn’t the William I knew, and I did know him, for longer than anyone still living and, since he’s dead now, I suppose for longer than anyone will get to. When I tell you he’d been a good sort for the most part, that’s because I think it’s the truth.

He was a farmer, a shepherd, better than some but no more special than most. The son of a farmer and the dad of a farmer and the husband of a farmer. He was quiet so we thought him principled, when he did speak it was to the point as if he read the paper too much. Kept to himself or his family as he could. He was houseproud yet never cleaned. Near the same age as me but you’d not know it. First hairs that grew out his chin were grey, and he never aged while always being bloody old. He wore this wax coat for the last seven years of his life and it fell dress-length. He buttoned it all the way up, so he looked like a man of God. His wife, Helen, she’d not let him keep it in the house, the coat, it stunk so bad of muck and wild mustard.

Like a lot of the hill people, the village didn’t see too much of him. Knew he was out there doing his work and you might run into him if you got lost in the fells or kept an eye on his stool at The Crown. He was well liked, though, respected even – was always a man you never wanted to bother with owt, but knew you could if it was needed. Took his role as a tourist attraction a touch serious. Would find more than a few offcomers talking of a farmer they could swear was staring them down a field away, or else they found him pointing to signs he kept about the place reading, Dogs off leash will be shot. If they laughed, he’d start barking at them like a dog himself.

Which is to say he’d always been some sort of mad bastard. To tell the truth we all are. Only thing in our heads is what’s about us. The sheep, the dogs, the fields. And when there’s only emptiness about, then I guess you’d call us empty-headed.

I’ll start with telling you about foot and mouth. Most won’t talk about it, worrying if they do that’ll make it come back. But without it, all you’ve got is what William did and not what made him do it. It began early spring in 2001. For us here in Cumbria anyroad. I gather it all started months before with some pillock in Northumberland feeding his pigs up on bits of other pigs from parts of the world where folk don’t look after animals. They say pigs will eat owt, sickness and all.

At the time I was back living on my dad’s farm. Montgarth it was called, a small place that peeled back from the road, scarce a thumbprint on the valley. The house we lived in and this storehouse next to it were forever sinking, inch by inch, year by year, pushing out the draining soil till the land pushed back and formed a banking all about it. From the way he kept it, my dad, you’d be forgiven for thinking it’d been left empty till you walked near and heard his dog yapping. The field walls were left to fall in on themselves and the gaps shod over with wood pallets and rolls of wire.

I’d been there maybe six months at that point, helping him out. He’d got so weak with it all that it made me forget why I left. Like everything he did he got weak in his own way. Was heading for his late sixties, what he’d call his eighties in workingman years. Could about lift a ewe above his head but was ten minutes getting up the stairs to take a piss. Three fingers on his right-hand curled inwards for good, and he could still work a pair of shears with nowt save his knuckles and thumb. He never asked for help, then you’d find yourself getting yelled at for not giving any. I tell you how it was with him. I’d been away for years as a driver. Working crop fields in sowing season, trailing clouds of lime the length of the east coast. Ground so flat you’d go for ten miles and still see the dust settling from that morning. Busy with all that, and he gave me a call, no clue how he’d got the number, and said, ‘When you coming home?’

‘I’ve no plans to,’ I told him. ‘I’ll be getting a place of my own soon, earning some cash. You ever heard of that? Making a life for myself like you always talked about.’

‘Doesn’t sound like it.’

‘You going deaf?

‘Less than you might think,’ he said.

I was back in my old room the week after.

 

We were waiting for the new year to bloom when we started hearing about it. Not on the local news. Radio even. But whispering, foot and mouth’s back. For people who spend all day with nowt but sheep for company we don’t half get some gossiping done.

Foot and mouth. Only folk old as my dad remembered what it was.

A letter turned up. Sat on the floor all morning before we gave in to take a look. It was full of pictures, a catalogue of raw-mouthed stock showing us what to watch out for. The sheep getting lazy, getting skinny. Lying like their bones are nests. Legs not moving, head and eyes not moving. Blisters on their feet, feet white, feet rotten. Blisters in their mouths, on their gums or tongues. Hot and cooked all over. Lambs born dead like they’re smarter than the rest. All that and it said to keep our flock indoors, or as close to that as we could fix. Keep it from spreading across the fells. My dad looked at the letter and told it to eff off. ‘I’m not doing that.’

‘Sounds like that’s what they’re asking for. Doing nowt.’

‘None of it, then. I’ll let the flock go where it wants. Sheep can make up their own minds.’

‘Says they’ll die if they get it.’

‘Aye, and to stop some of them from dying they’ll all be fit for being killed. Make any sort of sense to you?’

‘More to it than that.’

He told me to eff off.

For the bigger places, the farms needing maps to find the toilet and barns that tunnel the length of a field, they could have indoor sheep. Nightlights to calm the lambs and slam gates crossed to make hotel rooms for every gimmer, gummer, tup, and wether. Take them for daily walks on leashes through their feedlots and less crowding to be found about the bed straw than at a post office. That wasn’t us. If we called Montgarth a smallholding, then others called it a hobby plot. Only two hundred sheep left in the flock then. You’d think that’d make it easier, but we were headed into lambing. You couldn’t ask the mams to hold their bellies a few months while we locked them together in the two fields close to the house.

Our flock was living wild on the open fells a thousand foot atop the valley. We left them to wander the slopes and crags beyond the last stone walls – ones built to keep back the mountain fog. They made their dinner of what curled about rocks and lumped trees, skins of lichen on the faces of outcrops, some of it glowing greener than what spills out Sellafield. Sedges, whipping grass, string-stem ferns hid in the cracks of boulders, and winter heather that sprouts pink and reddens with the cold. My dad was being maungy and locked himself indoors in place of the stock, watching telly and swelling his chilblains on the hotlamp heater, with the only dog we had by his side.

I set off while it was still night. The sheep slept higher than where the flycatchers and doves roosted in cragfolds, and higher than where falcons nested watching their dinner below, and they’d lie on bare ground with steep rims at their backs, pressing their ears to the floor, listening for tumbling rocks. No place for quad bikes and if you’re talking sense, no place for people. I climbed over the pasture gates as practice for what was to come and there were two domes of rock that let you know you’d left the grasslands of Montgarth. The first slope past them is what we called eating your crusts. Wind stuck to it like a river, and you knew the end was close when you were rubbing grit out your eyes. Once you’d crawled over that, you came to a wide crest that made every gale fresh and there was a slow ridge along its back to the top of Gum Knott. I kept one foot in scree and the other on spongy turf. Walking steady. Before day comes over, you don’t know how alone you are out there. There’s no edge to the ground and any bump could be a bluff and there are boulders big enough to mistake for the sky, but it’s not so hard going when the only trail is the one your family’s spent sixty years treading out.

I saw the flock when my torch caught one of their eyes on a wide ledge of bracken. Lying in a pile to make windbreakers of themselves and taking turns as blankets. Had to wake them. Yelled loud enough to taste my throat and heard their bleating back. Waited as the lot of them clambered over, counting sheep on sheep dropping down the ledge, yan, taen, tedderte, medderte, pimp. Trick of moving a herd is to get them on a leader, on a bellwether, so the rest will follow. We call them sheep for a reason. In normal times, that leader would be me and they’d walk close enough that if I took a plunge off a cliff, they’d go down with me. But it was my dad they were used to, and a bucketful of pellets only kept their minds for so long. Left me the bloody dog work. Clapping under their chests so they skipped through my arms, shouting so they learnt the words, stick slid across their ribs shunting them like their mams once did. Held my crook in both hands to collar the jumpers and steer them off the mountain. Ewes in lamb are as keen for listening as any pregnant lass. By the time we were back at the domes of rock, I was wearing one of the bastards over my shoulders."

    "text": "I thought about my father. Long ago, I had asked him how he came to be my father. He sat poised in thought, before finally answering that he was, in fact, a foreigner, an officer who could pick locks and pilot aircraft. Before I was born, he had been a fighter pilot during the war, and he had been shot down during a sortie and crash-landed on a remote island in enemy territory, where he was captured. The islanders held him in a large dog cage under a banyan tree by the village square, awaiting the day when someone would convey him to a prison camp. And there he remained, for three long years. Every night, when he could not sleep, he would lie face down and imagine that it was all a dream. When the scorching rain fell from the sky, he would strip and shower in the downpour that came pounding through the leaves above him, which reeked of death. When they brought him food to eat, he devoured everything on the plate. When they came to throw a leash about his neck and take him out to an open field to relieve himself, he dutifully followed and shamelessly shat in full view of his captors. But wait, wasn’t he an expert at picking locks? Indeed, during the three years that he was caged, he had become so familiar with every steel bar that he could have set himself free with a flick of an eyelash.

But here’s the problem: the island was far too small. From within the dog cage, all he could see in every direction was the sea beneath the bowl of the sky, offering no escape, as if he were trapped in a giant ladle. And even if he were to slip from his cage in the dark, evade the guards, and hide himself in the windbreak, he was certain that these hardworking villagers – who had as little to occupy themselves as he did while waiting for the war to end – would run him to ground in whatever corner of the island he fled to, before dragging him back, dead or alive. My father would be fighting a losing battle, and so he planted himself within the cage like a seed, quietly awaiting the moment when he could breathe freely again under the sky. His wait went on and on until three summers later when, with the finger-wide band of the Milky Way spilling across the night sky between the Weaving Girl Star Vega and the Cowherd Star Altair, the two sorrowful lovers gazing across the celestial expanse that separated them, it occurred to him that life was absurd. Next to his cage was a sentry post, where the village head himself stood watch from four to six each morning. After his shift, the old man leapt upon a nearby dirt mound and delivered a spirited speech to the entire village, and thus became my father’s most dedicated playmate.

What my father remembered best, among these and other diversions, were the festive assemblies, when the elementary school teachers brought their students to observe him in the cage. On these occasions, he always tidied his garments, sat cross-legged, and put on a cheerful air to welcome them. On their respective sides of the bars, he and the students listened to the teachers pontificate about their nation’s inviolable dignity, about humiliation and hatred. After that, the teachers invariably ordered the students to step forward to the cage, one by one, and gaze down upon his face, the face of their enemy. When their eyes met, he composed himself and made a concerted effort to smile. He observed those little kittens in front of him learning how to deal with prey, insulting him with freshly acquired phrases, spitting at his face. There were always a few inventive ones, like those who struck the steel bars with their little caps in an attempt to scare him, which drew admiring looks from other children and transformed the event into a competition. None of this troubled him. What made him smile, and what he wanted to confirm with his smile, were the moments when a child who faced him showed signs of hesitation – a trace of confusion, or perhaps, as their eyes shifted and lips trembled, pity. He voraciously soaked up these moments, which gave him the conviction that he would one day, once again, become human. This was no exaggeration, he said, recalling that throughout his entire war-torn imprisonment, it was these moments, these signs alone, that sustained him. They might seem insignificant, but they were the only thing that made him feel touched.

He lived for those moments. Which was why, when the losers of the dare competitions returned the next day to humiliate him, pelting him with slingshots, he let the pebbles strike him without making a sound. Which was why late at night, he would sit with the village head and calmly, without a drop of self-pity, discuss the best way to raise well-mannered children. Which was why no dreams disturbed his sleep, why his meals were always delicious, and why he remembered, distinctively, every child’s face. It was because doing all this allowed him to be at ease. He did not dwell upon the past or future, conjure up crimes he had never committed, or subject himself to sufferings he did not deserve – that would have snapped his last thread of hope. Each time he was let out of the cage, all he concerned himself with was taking in the fresh air; each time he showered, all he cared about was getting clean. Perhaps the sole purpose of those isolated moments, in the continuous and eternal flow of time, was to allow him to survive, to occupy the only possible mode of existence for such a forlorn man. To some extent he, too, like all the villagers, had become a child of the war. And yet among them, he was somehow the only one capable of laughing aloud.

And there he lived until that morning, when the village head leapt again upon his dirt mound and declared, in a woeful voice, that the war was lost and they had surrendered. Which meant that the nation my father fought for had won. And which also meant, on this border island that had never been invaded and suffered no more than a single downed fighter jet, that my father had inexplicably become, after his long years in the dog cage, the solitary victor. My father tried to grasp the meaning of all this, but for some reason he could not wrap his head around it. Gazing upon the villagers on the square, he thought that they too were mulling their defeat. There was a calmness about them, as if a long-suffering toil was silently draining away, through the veins of some hidden aquifer. The villagers gathered into small groups, and the village head approached them one by one, murmuring in their ears a few words, exchanging a few thoughts. Now and then, someone raised their head and looked at my father from a distance. Apart from that, no one approached him at all, let alone talked to him. And then, as after every village meeting during the war, the crowd dispersed, going their separate ways, leaving my father alone on the boundless square.

He did not know what to do, so he remained in the cage and awaited whatever would befall him. He waited and waited yet more, but no one returned to stand sentry, and no one came to release him. The sun slowly reached its zenith, and cooking smoke began to rise from the chimneys around the square, soundlessly and delicately, matter-of-fact, as if evaporating whatever tension remained in the air. Completely drained, he lay down in the cage and fell asleep. It was a long and profound sleep, in which he dreamt of things being destroyed, though not anything worth cherishing. He awoke near evening, when the gentle breeze was combing through the silvergrass by the cage, and the smell of the ocean, like moldy dust, was drawn from the air by the westward light. He felt the salt crystals on his skin shedding themselves flake by flake, as if departing on tiptoe. He turned, and in the bottom of his vision, which had lost its sense of depth, he noticed the cage door gently swaying on its hinges.

That was it: the dog cage was open. While he was sleeping, someone had quietly come and unlocked the door. The world around him was so serene. He took a hesitant step out of the cage, and then stood tall on the open square. On the vast ocean enveloped by sky, scattered fishing boats were strung together along the tidal lines. His eyes winced in the strong light, and he noticed that the stacks of withered grass had been removed. Melons were quietly sprouting on the sand, like so many chubby deformed babies, their bodies and vines growing madly on this first day after the war. He left the square and walked into the village. The stone pavement was damp, and house gates were wide open, as if it was washing day. The women were busy with their work, diligently beating either their rugs or their children. At least one person from every household acknowledged him from a distance with an innocent smile, the simple smile they reserved for the rare visitor. A figure was waving and rushing toward him with large steps: it was the village head. The old man gave him the most innocent smile yet, the big smile that could only belonged to the head of an innocent village. Walking with appropriately powerful strides, his feet making appropriately brusque noises on the stone slabs, the old man came to a stop before my father, rested an appropriate hand on his shoulder, and invited him to sit down with him for a light dinner.

My father rubbed his neck, and his throat felt tight. The village head seemed so hospitable that my father became clumsy with his words, not knowing how to refuse, unable to utter anything in the local language he had long since absorbed. The village head smiled, a simple smile that meant, ‘I’m not quite sure what you mean, but I know why I don’t understand what you’re saying.’ The smile reminded him that he was, after all, a foreigner. And so he began speaking to the old man in his mother tongue. The village head continued to smile, revealing a simple expression that meant, ‘I’m honestly not sure what you mean, but I think you know why I don’t understand what you’re saying.’ This new expression irked my father, but the old man maintained his innocent smile. My father fell silent and began to feel anxious. He turned, desperate to escape the village and hide himself in a secluded corner of the island, should there remain a corner yet unfilled with smiling faces. He wanted to return to his cage. He went back on the village square, only to discover that the cage had disappeared. That was it: the dog cage was gone. He turned again and began walking. He had no choice but to head toward the shore. Because really, everything on the island, dead or alive, was smiling at him – even the wild flowers by the path were smiling so happily that their leaves trembled. He did not dare raise his head. He trudged through the windbreak and sat down on the beach, where the sun was finishing its descent beneath the sea."

    "text": "In the course of my countless journeys through the archipelago, I once encountered an island surrounded by green waters, hexagons of light dancing in the sun. The land was pale in comparison with the litharge of those seas, and with the wings of giant albatrosses sliding across the immaculate sky, the scene would have enchanted any human eye. You could only wonder whether that craggy place was not home to the untouched palace that the diminutive locals, with their fezzes of brick-red felt and stilettos in their cummerbunds, spoke of during the hour of siesta, while you squatted beside a wall and dragged on a shisha. There were, they said, many chambers in the palace, full of unknown wonders, but it was not these that merited risking your life, not these that were worth the trouble, to write a story with a needle in the corner of your eye. Rather, in the center of the palace was the Exit, blocked by a ferocious guardian, whom none could pass. No one had ever vanquished him, and the defeated warriors returned wizened and raw. What was beyond the Exit no one knew, but the angels who occasionally descended to the islands, be it to bless a procession of tear-stained icons, or to rebuke a fool who slept with his wife while she was unclean, or to run various other errands, told of a depth as endless as the ocean floor littered with shattered wooden boats, their holds filled with treasure, and surrounded by fish with pointed beaks, and octopi, and ancient statues of marble flesh.

Any sailor, it was said, might reach that island once in his life, guided by the zodiac charts consulted at his birth. I was thus not surprised that, at the age of fifty – when a man whose skin has been thickened by salt and storms is drawn toward home – it was given to me to place my foot on the burning sands of that storied island. I was not afraid, nor was I pleased: thus it had to be, as I always told myself when facing a new day, a new woman, a new stranger with my knife in his chest. One cannot do anything but what heaven compels. In a man’s last moment, he regards his life and understands: thus it had to be.

I made land on a dinghy, leaving the barque a hundred cubits’ distance from the rocks. The sun was high, I saw no shadow. Fig trees grew wild, full of violet fruits. In the middle of the island was a ring of cliffs, as slim and irregular as a giant’s teeth. With much effort, I found the narrow through which I could penetrate. And there, rising between the rocks, with yellow walls bracing an arched cupola in the shape of a skull, was the palace built by inhuman hands. I entered it as much in search of shade as of adventure, the sun having become blistering, and my clothes and hair were soaked with sweat as though I had swum there. In the vast halls I found shadow, much shadow, thick shadow, of the highest quality.

The palace was immense and deserted, its walls covered with arabesques. In the interior courtyards, fountains lay still, their waters long since evaporated. In their spiral basins, spiders wove dusty cobwebs. The halls were lined with doors; I opened as many as I could. Each led into a chamber with a window facing the sea. Each had a stone cube in its center, where a baffling machinery churned, a golden fish flapped, suspended in a crystal sphere, or a girl sat with her feet hanging, her face sulking at me, like a strange fruit of the sea, wearing a breastplate of rose ivory. Another chamber held a lobster the size of a large dog; it pinched beads of water between its claws and regarded me with blind eyes.

There were more and more halls, but soon I stopped investigating the closed doors, abandoning the surprises that might have been waiting in the chambers behind them, because I was impatient to stand before the Exit. I advanced for hours over the gentle tiles of polished stone. Here and there I passed large, symmetrical openings in the exterior walls, where I saw the sky and sea on every side. Pelicans rested on long ledges, peering inside with one red eye, but not daring to violate the shadow with their flight. Just when I began to lose faith in the stories of the island and to ruminate a return to my ship, I passed through a high arch of porphyry that led into the chamber of the great portal. The chamber was perfectly round, and in its perimeter I counted eleven entrances like this one, buried in the same scarlet stone. The opposite doors could barely be seen across the room’s immensity. I reckoned I was in the palace center, under the skull-like dome visible from the shore, and which, now I marveled, had its hemispheric ceiling painted with the volutes of a brain – the living and mortal throne of the human soul.

In the precise center of the room something flashed like lightning. A perpendicular column of pure light descended from the large round hole at the apex of the cupola, a sign that the sun stood constantly above the island. Flickering in the distance was the portal; its flames blinded me as I approached the central depth of the chamber with my arm across my eyes. In this same posture, once in the days of my youth, had I thrown myself from the ship’s prow into the flashing ocean, in the center of its roundness, and swam toward the sun on its path of fire and water, the rays and wetness quivering in ever-changing proportions.

When I reached the Exit I was so stunned my heart stopped, because at the same moment, as though waiting for me since the beginnings of the world, from the depths of the Exit appeared the guardian. Now we stared at each other fiercely, determined to stand our ground. He had sworn an oath to the gods to repel intruders, even at the price of his life, and I was constant in my desire to know what lay beyond, and my will was equal to any oath, and any god. We stood face-to-face, with the portal between us, our eyes glaring at the other ferociously.

The guardian was a hearty man about fifty. A scar, similar to the one that furrowed my left temple, also furrowed his, but on the right side. His clothes matched mine, but he was evidently left-handed, because he wore his hilt on his right hip. His boots had perhaps been made by the same bootmaker as worked mine, but then he had mistaken the two initials of his name, printed near the top of the leather: the guardian’s were strangely reversed.

I took a step forward, and he did as well. I attempted to pass him, and he blocked my way, rushing toward the side where I advanced. I shoved him and he shoved me, with his hands braced against my own. Scarlet with fury, I drew my dagger from my waistband and he drew his own at the same moment. I aimed the tip of my blade at his heart and – who will believe me? Who could believe in curses and magic? – our blades met in the middle at their finest tips, as had never before happened and could never happen. I threw my weapon onto the floor, convinced it would be of no use, and he did the same, perhaps relying more on the diabolical power of his spells and charms.

We stood face-to-face, two men huffing with the weight of their years, looking hopelessly at each other. I rose again, reengaged the battle with all my power – but to no end. It was as though he had a thousand hands and a hundred bodies. His bearded head, his broad chest, his large belly, his sculpted thighs filled every corner of the Exit’s shimmering expanse. Hour after hour passed in clenches, huffing, groans and sweat, our bellows cast against and resounding from the chamber’s distant walls.

I faced the guardian, who had exhausted all his previous adversaries, and I searched for a way to prove myself more cunning than he. I studied his movements. I dropped my head and looked at him through my eyebrows, and he did precisely the same. But if I leaned to the right, he leaned to the left, remaining my opposite. I leaned forward, and he did the same. I raised my left arm, he his right. I put my hand over my heart: his heart was on the right! The monster only appeared to be human, under his skin he was inverted, as the left hand is to the right. I stood again before the Exit – the only one in our world, as the all-knowing and tight-lipped women had told me in the fruit market – and I leaned my chest against his, my eyes on his eyes, my mouth on his mouth, my hands and feet on his hands and feet, pressing with all my might against his strong and immobile body. We pressed our foreheads against each other until our browbones were bruised.

I could not pass. My amazement knew no bounds. I had expected a hard battle with the omnipotent guardian, I had thought that in the end I would writhe in my own blood, but such direct and stubborn opposition completely disoriented me. I was about the same stature as he: why couldn’t I send him to one side so I could finally pass beyond him? Was it my fate never to see the treasures of the sunken galleys, the pale statues, the deceitful glints of the depths?

I stayed there for days on end, first looking for a crack in the defense of the terrible guardian, then lying on the floor resigned, and then overwhelmed with fury and kicking and punching against the ever-potent refusals of his feet and hands, then again hopeless, stretched over the floor . . . I sat one evening on the cool tiles, and he did the same. I lay my entire body on the floor, and bracing my chin in my hands, I pondered until I felt my mind would explode. The brave guardian was obviously as strong as I was. Bodily vigor had proven pointless, I would not get rid of him but through some ruse, which I should devise as quickly as possible.

Through the large, azure opening in the peak of the cupola, swarms of angels constantly descended, bathed in light, as irritating as mosquitoes. They gathered around me, they offered asinine advice, they spoke of dogmas and mysteries, they bored me with their ashen faces that knew neither laughter nor tears. Others, identical and evasive, perched on the sills along the chamber’s narrow windows, dangling their legs inside, written like icons in two types of blue, that of the sea below and that of the sky above.

Angels, in that summer, had infested the entire archipelago. In other years there had been harpies, and before that there were soft, transparent rocks that would swallow a man whole, and then spit out his bones only a few moments later. The old people remembered the depraved women of the sea, who in ancient times emerged from the foamy waves to show the fisherman, in an extended palm, their lemon-like eggs, each with a person crouched inside. And each tiny person resembled the fisherman and called him Father, begging him to take them home to his earthen hut. The angels were not the worst infestation the archipelago had periodically experienced, but they were the most insufferable, harping on endlessly: thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not murder, thou shalt not covet your neighbor’s wife . . . The old tars often claimed the man-eating stones were more humane. Now the angels sat like pelicans on the windowsills, twisting their heads to either side, perhaps laying bets on the eventual victor, because I often saw, from the corner of my eye, the flash of coins being flipped in the air and dexterously caught with a smack of the right palm on the back of the left. ‘Heads,’ some shouted, ‘Tails,’ said others, but I could not guess the battle’s denouement until one of them shouted loud enough to echo through the dome, in agony or in triumph. He had driven his coin, which in the air resembled a dandelion tuft, impetuously into the flesh of his left hand, where it had landed on its edge. He could just make out the ridges, like those of a giant fish, on the back of his bloody hand. When I heard the unlucky angel’s cry, like a wounded bird, I received a blessed thought from on high.

Heaven’s stars do not bestow on us, we human beings, merely resilience and courage; they also give wisdom. Often a small and nimble ship, with well-sewn sails, may sink the heavy galleon that vainly blasts its cannons at flies. I remembered one afternoon the story of a muezzin, on one of these islands, who only descended from his minaret to milk his goats. He had heard, and told the same to others, that in the wilds of other lands, a small creature resembling a weasel bested the great hooded snake with a wondrously devious tactic: face-to-face with the giant serpent, overshadowed by its hood, this creature of God called the mongoose began to dance, up and down, side to side, while the evil worm did the same, its head raised and tail twisted into the dust. To and fro, left and right, to and fro, left and right, to and fro . . . always the same and ever faster, until the snake came to believe that it knew, a moment ahead, what its enemy would do. When the speed reached the point you could barely see the two heads moving together, the mongoose suddenly changed its movement: instead of right, it went left, and the reptile, leaning to the opposite side, for a brief moment revealed its neck. In a flash it pounced onto the snake’s back and killed it with a cry of victory.

This idea reinvigorated me. I leapt in that moment to my feet and once again moved toward the great Exit, the only one in our world. As I fully expected, the guardian appeared, determined and also reinvigorated, from his hellish hole. I stood a few moments without moving, pondering my tactic, assembling my plan from forty steps, in the six directions in which the human mind can think: forward, back, left, right, leap, crouch. Difficult to learn, but easy to remember (because the steps repeated in a delicate order whose import slowly came clear), my dance was as symmetrical and subtle as a spider’s web. When I lifted my eyes, I met his gaze and thought I saw a chill flash through his body. Taking one step to the left, I began, as slowly as in a dream, the deadly dance, the final dance, the dance of all dances.

I laid, ten times in a row, the trap of steps, each time slightly faster than before. Then another ten times. And another. The monster came forward, moved back, leaned his body to the right and to the left without mistake, he leapt and crouched at the same moment I did, with the precision of an astrolabe. I started the series of movements again, with re-energized speed, until I thought my shoulders would pop from their sockets and my knees would split apart. After the fortieth identical repetition, heated as though enveloped by flames, I made the first foreign movement. Sudden and bewildering, as though I had grown an extra hand, or my body had grown an extra body. But the monster made no mistake. At the same time, in the same split second, he also turned from the beaten path, following the unknown. We found ourselves again chest-to-chest, we saw our eyes again full of hate, we broke our fists on the other’s fists, our screams echoing the other’s screams.

I began again, with the strength of ten men. I laid the trap hundreds and thousands of times. I suddenly changed my movement in so many ways and at so many different moments that the change itself became part of the dance, just as easy to predict as the trap’s forty steps. For that reason, perhaps, the guardian never made a mistake, however deft my movements. One thousand times, one million times, more times than grains of sand and more than all the tears the world has ever shed, I started the dance over again, without understanding that I had been caught in my own trap and that I danced a petty, fruitless dance that would lead to no victory.

When I suddenly understood what the angels had shouted, that battle is not battle but a dance without beginning, without end, and without limit, I gave up on the trap and the mongoose stratagem. I forgot about the guardian and did nothing other than live in the eternal fire of the dance, with no goal, with no desire, with no memory. I danced with all my might, I danced with twenty hearts and eight arms, I danced with thousands of feet, I danced with the six dimensions that grew from my kidneys and time’s lance emerging from below my left breast. I didn’t dance, rather I was danced, I merely placed my hands and feet inside the hands and feet of the dance. With my body, my strings of guts, my veins, my blood and my bile, with my spine I filled the entire chamber of the great portal, leaving not even the point of a needle unfilled with blood, sperm, teeth and nails, with thousands of eyes and thousands of ears and thousands of fingers and thousands of lips. I danced the Archimedian spiral, I danced the golden ratio, I danced the Fibonacci sequence, I danced the Lie groups, I danced the sacred dance of quaternions and octonions. I danced the genesis of space on the Planck scale and the birth of time in causation, and the hideous screams of Bekenstein scales and the 10, 500 possible, impossible, probable, improbable universes, and the dust of galaxies from Laniakea, the dust of dust of dust of galaxies, the dust of dust of dust of worlds . . . I danced the eternal flame, its eternal return of spark and snuff, furiously consuming the logical space of the mind. I danced the melted gold icon of the Godhead.

As I danced to one side and the other of the Exit, I was the portal, I was the guardian, I was the wheel of angels, I was the palace, I was the sea. The brain, heart and sex, so often pitted against each other, were now a single organ, whose thought flowed into sensation, sensation into pleasure, and pleasure back into thought, and everything broke through my skin and poured into the skin of the world, and broke through and poured, wastelaying and torrential and unstoppable, into the icon of the All, which it also broke through to pour itself into the eternal and ineffable Nothing.

When the dance finished, I found myself again on the threshold of the great portal. Beyond it now was no one. But I could not find within me any reason left to enter. I turned back and crossed the chamber again, under the eyes of angels in the windows, I left through the porphyry archway, I retread the long corridors, without the desire to open a single door. I came into the steady sunlight of the afternoon, crossing the ring of cliffs, passing beside the fig trees with violet fruits to reach my dinghy perched on the shore. The archipelago with its glassy sea, blazing against my sight, with its forested coastlands, seemed to me beauties beyond our power to express. I reached my ship ready to pull the sea air into my chest, my skin wizened by salt and storms. And this is what I have done until today, because this is man’s fate on earth. At some moment I will turn homeward, but not as long as I feel a trace of life left within me. And with my last breath, I hope I will be able to say to myself, in peace, with my hand on my right breast, over my heart, unafraid: thus it had to be."

    "text": "Midway through the nineteenth century, as the rivers filled with evangelists and explorers in anticipation of the rubber fever soon to come, the voices of dozens of false millennialist prophets began to be heard through the Amazon rainforest. Visions of the end, speeches of redemption and repentance that would not have been out of place in the mouth of a European swindler, but that in this case were spoken in Indigenous languages. Of those that Juan Gómez has heard, the story of Awacaipu is the most memorable. A former assistant to the naturalist Robert Schomburgk, whose intrepid British team forged its way over those tumultuous rivers just a few years before, Awacaipu had managed by the 1840s to congregate hundreds of Amerindians. The name he gave to his settlement, located in a clearing between two rivers, was Beckeranta: ‘land of the whites’. As a talisman of his divine power, he distributed pages from the Times of London to loyal members of the flock, pages that his former boss had used to wrap exotic flowers, but that now illustrated a millenarian promise: his devotees would someday have white skin, marry European women, and carry pistols rather than bows. In exchange, the false prophet asked for only one thing: those who wanted all of this first had to die. On the night of the full moon, they would drink and dance beyond the limits of their reason, after which they would have to end their lives by their own hands. The next day they would be reborn on Mount Roraima, transformed into white souls, their skin as pale as the moon.

 

Even though he is a historian, Gómez sometimes feels that history bores him. He gets tired of events threaded one after another like the beads of an old rosary, proposing causes and effects where initially there existed only the furor of the present. Maybe for that reason, leaving his coffee to one side to again confront the image staring at him from the pages of the newspaper, which shows hundreds of migrants crossing the Darién Gap, he thinks of Awacaipu’s Beckeranta and tells himself that it is prophecy, delirium and senselessness that interest him, not history itself. The echoes that history produces against its will. He looks at the newspaper and thinks of the migrants making their way through the tangled jungle of the Darién, and he remembers how his father, during the nights of a now distant childhood, told him stories of those lands, and the way they seemed to inhabit another world. His old man spent his entire life working for the ships that crossed the Panama Canal. The canal is only a few hours away from the Darién, but when he spoke of the territory, it was as if it were a magical world that would take months to reach.

This is how Gómez grew up, hearing tales of a supposedly impenetrable jungle so dense that not even the ants could cross it. More than once, at the end of a story, he asked his father to take him one day, only to hear him laugh as he explained that it was impossible, since the highways did not stretch that far. Later, at school, his geography teachers backed up this claim: the Darién Gap is the only point where the Pan-American Highway that runs across South America all the way to North America is interrupted. ‘That is the reason we are Panamanians and not Colombians,’ they would add with a hint of mischief, gesturing toward the map to emphasize the proximity of Panama to the United States, a sarcastic movement that seemed to suggest that they were closer to the gods.

Looking at the images of the migrants, who seemed to be crossing that gap so easily now, Gómez thought of his father. He had reached an age when he could look with tenderness at the older man’s errors. Not as flaws, but as relics of an earlier age. His old man was no longer there to look with him at the thousands of people launching themselves across that territory every month, rucksack in hand and child on their back, no longer there to call it a recreation of the feat that for his father bore a single name: Richard Oglesby Marsh.

Maybe that is the reason that Gómez has been dedicating his afternoons to rewriting, in secret and in the form of a novel, the story of Marsh, a story he first heard in the hoarse voice of his father. In his father’s telling, Marsh’s crossing seemed otherworldly, blameless and mythical, more of a dream than a reality. It was a fairy tale that as a young boy had made him think of the books of Julio Verne.

 

The truth is that Marsh never imagined he would end up a revolutionary in the Darién. How could he have imagined it? He didn’t know there were people there. He thought the jungle was virgin territory. Later, he would be called a traitor for siding with us, the Kuna, instead of the Panamanian state. But that was later. In the beginning, Marsh arrived with a simple mission, one that had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with money: he came looking for fertile land where rubber could be planted, financed by none other than Henry Ford and Harvey Firestone. Their factories needed rubber, simple as that. Marsh had previous experience visiting plantations in Ceylon and Malaya, so Ford asked him to explore new lands. The Darién at that time did not even appear on maps, though we had always been there, navigating its swollen rivers and jungle. Marsh had the luck, or perhaps it was a curse, to arrive and see the few of us among the tribe with fair skins. ‘White Indians’ he called us.

Marsh did not find what he was looking for. The jungle in the Darién is resistant to crops. Our land is incorruptible, our rivers furious. Marsh found no arable land, but he did find a myth – a fantasy, a chimera. White Indians. Sometimes one can move the world this way, chasing dreams. The rumor of our existence spread through the jungle and beyond, and sometimes we laughed at the fascination we exerted. But it was only later, when I came to know Marsh better, that I understood how deep the enchantment truly went.

For me it was different. This was how I was born. Ever since they watched me enter this life, the tribe called me Chepu, which for us Kuna people means ‘white’. They separated me from the others and forbade me from marrying. They put me in a shack with those who were like me. For me, whiteness was damnation. But for Marsh it meant purity and elegance.

There were evenings in Washington when he would become nostalgic and reminisce about his adventures in the Darién. I laughed when I heard him tell his gathered associates, always with passion, the story of how he came to discover our existence. He would light a Havana cigar and say that instead of rubber, he’d found something far more valuable: thousands of white Indians, never before described by science. A lost tribe of Europeans.

Now that he is no longer here, I sometimes sit down with the book he wrote about us: White Indians of the Darién. He published it in 1934, more than a decade after the events it describes. I settle into the rocking chair and pursue his fascination like someone stalking a delirium not his own, watch him mounted in the canoe with his team of Black guides and explorers, heading up the Chucunaque until he reaches the village of Yaviza. For Marsh, it was all strange: he had been sure that the Darién was a virgin land, innocent of the sins of history, but wherever he looked there were ruins. Vestiges of an old Scottish colony, abandoned huts of a German radio station, works of the Sinclair Oil Company, debris produced by the United Fruit Company. He had traveled to the Darién trying to escape history, and all he found was its rubble.

In Yaviza he saw a handful of dilapidated bamboo cabins. Muddy land crowded with flies and Black babies, dogs and trash. Marsh detested anyone who was not white, it must be said, for all it pains me to do so. Maybe it was for that reason he looked away, toward a clearing that extended into the jungle. This is when he witnessed the scene that would change his life. In the clearing, he glimpsed the silhouettes of three white Indigenous women, all of them adolescents. Long, blonde hair falling in perfect cascades over semi-naked bodies. Scandinavian bodies, as he describes them in the book. White bodies that disappeared into the jungle, giving way to the obsession that Marsh would pursue for years to come. He knew that we existed, that we were not just a myth. And if today I am here in Washington, it is because Marsh knew that nobody would believe him if he didn’t put a white Indian like me in front of his compatriots, an Indian as pale as those girls he saw vanish into the tropical forest, a sight that left him with the sensation he was losing hold of the threads of a dream. It was a twisted dream, that became clear to us rather quickly. His dream turned us into souvenirs brought from afar, objects of science rather than men.

 

In the afternoons, while writing, Gómez often remembers with perplexity the way his father, who was even darker than himself, used to narrate the story from the perspective of Marsh. The triumph of crossing the Darién, the vindication of finding his ‘white Indians’, the stand he made in the end on behalf of the Kuna, fighting alongside them against the state. The irony of it all seemed lost to him. Did he not see that Marsh had been mistaken? That there had been no lost tribe of Europe? That might be why Gómez has decided to narrate the story from the perspective of Chepu, the Kuna boy that Marsh brought to Washington in the name of science when he was only ten.

Gómez had landed three hours late. The old man was already gone. Later that day, with the funeral preparations under way, he had distracted himself by inspecting the fifteen or so books on his father’s shelves. Lost among fishing manuals he found an old copy of Richard O. Marsh’s White Indians of the Darién and, within it, a magazine clipping with a photograph of Marsh in Washington, accompanied by a Kuna boy. The caption read: ‘Marsh alongside “Chepu”, a ten-year-old White Indian boy from San Blas.’ Looking at the young, pale boy, his face expressing discomfort and confusion, Gómez smiled briefly, thinking how obvious it was that this was a simple case of albinism. In his father’s telling of the story everything had been so mysterious. So much larger than life.

Now, pausing in his writing, he wonders from what position someone like him, a Panamanian mixed-race man who has never been to the Darién, should narrate this history of dreams and wars. From what position should a Panamanian mixed-race man who has spent thirty years lost in the Anglo-Saxon academy narrate this history of borders and migrants? From what position should someone like him, a mixed-race man that Marsh himself would surely have looked upon with contempt, narrate this story of racial chimeras? The thing is, for all he knows it is not his place, sometimes he also sees himself as a kind of ‘white Indian’, a paradox forged by the strength of others’ dreams and by his own repression. He thinks of himself as a man who has learned to be white by living among white people, though all it takes is a look in the mirror to realize his error. Perhaps that is why he finds his way into the story alongside Chepu, now a man, taken from one place he didn’t belong, to another.

 

As soon as Marsh saw those pale adolescents disappear into the jungle, he set himself the task of finding them. It mattered little to him that neither Ford nor Firestone cared about our existence. Marsh pursued us with the force and ambition with which others seek riches. We were his delirium. He went back to the United States and looked for funding. It came easily. The Smithsonian, the Natural History Museum of New York, and the University of Rochester all took his side. The world of science wanted us to exist, they wanted a mirror that would show themselves reflected everywhere. A short time later Marsh was back, navigating the Chucunaque with a twelve-person team despite everyone in his path advising him against it, saying that the Kuna were fierce, and that no white man had survived the crossing. He didn’t listen. Accompanied by the crew of scientists and soldiers the Smithsonian had provided, he crossed the Darién heading south.

We all know the way fantasies work. To pursue them in reality is enough to see them disappear behind the veil from which they emerge. So it happened to Marsh. He did not find white Indians anywhere. All he found were the suspicious gazes of a crew that, tired of exploring, spent their hours measuring out the dangers that surrounded them. They were right to do so. I am sure the jungle would have devoured them had it not been that Marsh, always perceptive, knew how to strike up friendships with the peoples he did find. Marsh had long since perfected the knack of the gift: he carried a trunk with him everywhere, from which he took out small offerings brought from the Western world. Nobody dares say it, but I will: Marsh was the only one who could win over the Darién, uniting tribes in peace that until then had been fighting. He was blind to his true motives, to the force of his malady, larger than any conflict and any rivalry. But history is often made by people who blindly follow a vague intuition. It was this intuition that finally brought him to what he was looking for. The intuition that if what he was looking for were white Indians, he himself had to turn Indian, and that is what he did, in a manner of speaking. He deepened his friendships with our leaders, he began to understand our problems, he made our battle his own. The government wanted to us to speak their language, dress like them, go to their schools. But for Marsh, all this was pointless. We were pure and white already. Any association with Panama could only stain us. The chiefs heard him and understood they had found the man they needed to declare war on the state. Only then did they grant him the mirror he was looking for. That was when we were made to appear.

I will always remember my first impression of Marsh. He seemed to me an exhausted madman. In his eyes I read the fatigue of all he had seen and lost. But his exhaustion jolted into energy when we started to arrive by the dozens. In exchange for promising us the independence of the Kuna peoples, our leaders granted him the vision that had escaped him for so long. White Indians. I was only ten years old, but I remember looking at him from top to bottom, dressed with absurd formality in the mud. White like us, but infinitely distant.

 

Gómez likes to think he has preserved some of his father’s ways of narrating the story: the snapshot-like, episodic quality of narrative, the atmosphere of reverie that pervaded his storytelling. But his old man’s story was straightforward and epic, the tale of a white man saving a forgotten people, while his own is opaque. He has grown rather fond of Chepu, of his contradictions and his ambiguities. Often he thinks of the face he saw in the magazine clipping, the bewildered countenance that looked at him from the page. Chepu, a boy who must have felt foreign everywhere. Maybe for that reason, as the image of the Darién migrants silently interrogates him from the newspaper, he remembers his first months in the United States, and the sensation of foreignness that invaded him then. He never said anything to his parents. He never complained. He had fought hard to win the scholarship, and a return to Panama would have been a failure. But he felt nausea and anxiety, and his consciousness was focused on a foreign language that always eluded him. Even so, the pride of being there, in halls filled with portraits of distinguished academics, had helped keep his insomnia at bay. He had adapted, little by little, learning the forms and references, slowly forgetting his difference, learning to be one among many. A ‘white Indian’, he thinks, laughing to himself.

If his peers at the university found out about his novel, what would happen? Telling the story from Chepu’s position. Adopting the Indigenous voice. It was appropriation. He can’t see how they would understand that all of history intuitively leads him back to that same place, to that figure of the young boy turned middle-aged man, remembering his guardian with that contradictory mix of affection and reproach.

 

Perhaps my name is what allowed him to project his dream upon me. Chepu. They gave it to me as soon as they saw I was white as milk. I think it is the reason why, at the end of the trip, Marsh decided that out of all of us who had traveled to Washington, I would be the one to stay with him. Maybe he felt my name captured the essence of it all. We were twelve: nine with brown skin, there to represent the political interests of the Kuna tribes, and three of us who were white, brought as subjects of scientific investigation. Mimi, as beautiful as the moon, must have been fifteen or sixteen. Olonipiguina, with whom I had spent my childhood, was fourteen. I was the baby. A ten-year-old forced to stand in front of the eyes of science, as if he were a strange flower brought from afar. Marsh brought me to Washington, proudly presented me, and then left me behind. He kept his promise. It was his responsibility to return to the jungle, to lead the uprising.

I didn’t ask questions. I looked around, confirmed how different this new world was from the one I had left, and sat down to wait. Marsh gave me his home, but deprived me of mine. I remember thinking how huge the house felt, how empty and vast. Then it began to fill with the rumors and stories that arrived from the isthmus. It was said that Marsh had helped our leaders draw up a declaration of independence. It was whispered that he had helped supply our peoples with arms for the approaching battle. I heard all this and imagined Marsh amid the stormy, treacherous rivers of the Darién, fighting in our name. As winter arrived in Washington, we found out more. The Kuna, led by a Marsh who had begun wearing Indigenous attire, took Panamanian forts in Narganá and Sidra. We heard how after a tough battle they occupied the island of Parvenir. When Marsh returned, we learned that it was there, in Parvenir, that the meeting had been held. A meeting convened by the United States ambassador to which Marsh showed up late. The two representatives were already there and seated, the North American on one side, the Kuna on the other. I will never forget how Marsh sat on our side during that meeting.

Marsh returned to Washington a few months later, carrying the newspapers that announced his expulsion from Panama at the hands of President Chiari, the same dignitary who was promising to evangelize and civilize the Darién. Marsh held the pages as if they were jewels, proud of the news that they did not carry: the triumph of the Kuna peoples, the agreement the government had reached with our leaders. Marsh was transformed. It was as if something in him had broken while he fought in the Darién, or perhaps it had been lost in that clearing where he saw us for the first time, and where for the first time I saw him. More than once, in the years that followed, I saw him sitting in front of the trunk he brought back with him from Panama, that trunk he’d filled with the gifts that had gained him the friendship of our peoples. He sat there and reread those newspaper pages, and the letters he’d received from our leaders, poring over the strange story that he had lived. And I wondered, watching from a distance, if he had ever really seen us, or if we had never been more than a reflection of his self, and of his racial malady.

 

Sitting in the professors’ lounge, sensing that the hour has nearly come for his lecture, Juan Gómez confronts the photograph in the newspaper one last time. The Darién of his boyhood had turned into a migratory route. If only he could tell his father about it, say that the migrants were managing to do what the engineers who had conceived the Pan-American Highway could not. He wonders how his father would have received this new story, how he would have narrated it back to him. What voice would he have adopted, what perspective. Where would he position himself in this new epic? He tries to imagine the migrants on their arduous journey, heading toward their own delirious fantasy of an America that no longer exists, but at each step the silhouette of Richard Oglesby Marsh intrudes. With the bitter taste of coffee still in his mouth, he lays aside the newspaper and stands up, conscious for a moment of the dozens of portraits of white men looking down at him from the lounge’s walls.

    "text": "After hearing a phrase of music, memory suddenly rises in front of you like the clearing mist of the blue Northern Range.

The heavy smoke of pitch-oil flambeau.

The smell of rain on warm asphalt in the night.

The wail of your father. The silence of your mother.

Some nights you will not forget, even though you feel you bury it deep enough.

Is a brand to the back of your skull, somehow still burning, still on fire, hiding up in layers of flesh, follicles, a web of nerves. Then suddenly it come back to malign your mind with misery and guilt.

Is like that for me now, stick up in traffic on the way to San Fernando, and a station start to play a song that feel like a knife plunge in my belly.

Me eh know what old time disc jockey dig up this old-time song from my youth. Gogi Grant’s The Wayward Wind.

The song is a pull to my navel string. The way eating the flesh of the armoured cascadura does call you to come back home to die in Trinidad – that song pull my soul back to Chaguanas.

Old Chaguanas, from sixty years back. A flood of memories erupting and fighting for the spotlight in my mind – the smell of burning sugarcane and rotting bagasse – that scent like festering flesh. The splash of cold water from a gleaming copper basin on the days that boiled us in sweat, roaming through the rows of Woodford Lodge estate looking for adventure. The sizzling crack of a film projector, the unnatural firmness and coldness of the Anglican cemetery.

The bellowing of a bison, his voice vibrating down the thick muscles of his neck. The Chaguanas I did only know about was the one from the early fifties, when a talk did start up bout electricity coming to the village. Back then it was a village, but oui papa, today them does call it a Borough.

To help we understand what this electricity did mean, they had was to set up a Delco generator and a silver screen in the Woodford Lodge Cricket Field to play a flim.

I could remember that day good, man.

Me and my pardna, Jaikaran, had gone down early in the morning to gawk at the equipment. A huge scaffold coming down where the cricket fielders woulda be posted. A string of bulbs wrapped around the massive appamat trees, an untethered silk screen whipping out in the breeze. And reel, man, reel ah flim offloading from a cart.

We ask the man, what it have dey on them flim?

He say it go show a man and his wife tending to a farm with the use of something none of we had – electricity. The flim wasn’t meant to be science fiction, but it did feel like that way to we.

We did live in darkness. If you did forget to light your home flambeau, you was getting suck into the oblivion every night.

Papa did tell me it was a good thing that we was going to get electricity, because the kinda darkness we in, it does let the mind run mad with superstition.

Papa was a logical man who did follow the see it and believe it platitude of life. Mammy was the opposite – according to my Pa, she find great solace in the greatest superstition of all – religion. Never see a woman so deeply committed to the tenets of the church and feel she self more missionary than parishioner. She favourite story revolve round the evangelising and conversion of the savages.

But here in the heart of Chaguanas, it didn’t have no such savages, so she find them in she own children.

She had us reading the Bible every morning, covering it end-to-end every three years. Up to now, I can quote everything from the wrath of Elijah to the temptations of Christ.

And as much as she believe in the angels, Mammy believe even more in the devil. She listen to every tale of myth, spirit and monster and did know of every practised way to outwit a demon.

Rub dog yampi in your eye, look through a keyhole and you would see a lagahoo.

If you meet a La Diablesse, strip yourself naked, turn your clothes inside out and put them on again, she eh go seem to trace you after that.

To see a soucouyant, put fowl shit in your eye and watch up in the night sky.

That last one, I make it up, but I sure I could ketch my mother with it.

Mammy did feed on every tale the neighbours had about the strange things they see while walking home in the night. The latest one was from Brother Lal, a fellow parishioner from two streets over. A few nights earlier, he did come across a bison while walking home from the train station. The bison was standing up on two hind legs at the crossroads beneath a wide spreading Samaan tree. He mouth was open long and low, almost big enough like a man could crawl in. The beast give a long, wide grin – teeth glittering in a rod of moon light, glittering like gold. When he watch good, this bison whole mouth was full of gold teeth. The lips curl back and a deep baritone voice rumble from the belly of the beast and ask – ‘How you coming home so late, Lal?’

Brother Lal say he dunno if he grow wing and fly, but he reach home in a panic and fall down in front he gate.

Mammy hold a long prayer session the next night for Brother Lal and he family, with she own offspring as congregation in tow. Brother Lal look like he couldn’t even raise up he head good, cold sweating on a bench under a pitch-oil lamp. He big daughter sitting on a peerha, massaging he foot.

‘The devil doesn’t come in person, he too full of spite and shame and laziness,’ Mammy say. ‘He does always send he son, that is who Lal see that night.’

‘Minds running mad with superstition,’ Papa say. He eh even try to whisper self.

Mammy never take he on, nah.

She see so much children dying of obeah-inflicted polio, and maljeaux tuberculosis, that she give she first born child a name that would strike fear into the hearts of any demon. To ensure the protection of any scion to follow.

The name was Gabriel and that unfortunate first-born was me.

As the oldest sibling, I always had to walk with a horde of children – three boys and five girls. Me at the head, bearing the name that meant Warrior of God.

We use to walk in order of birth. To church, to school. Eventually the line start to look uneven when my brother, Isaac, then thirteen, just three years younger than me, had a potent growth spurt. A whole head taller than me.

He throw everything off balance.

He whole existence used to throw me off balance.

If I say A, Isaac went with B.

He was prone to what he did call adventures, like if he had an irrepressible pull to wander every trace and tributary contained in Chaguanas.

He go come up to me and say, ‘Boy, you hear it have wild cat in De Verteuil Estate?’

‘Boy, it eh ha no wild cat there,’ I go say.

But come Saturday evening, this boy cover up in mud and scratch, eyes wide, mouth spreading, belly big with laugh, telling me he see the wild cat.

What I go say, Isaac live up to the meaning of his name, He Will Laugh. You couldn’t tell him to do nothing, no chore at all, he done disappear for the next adventure, and more laugh.

He exist without any kind of responsibility, waltzing and chirruping, full of songs, his favourite one being fit for his ceaseless wandering – Gogi Grant’s The Wayward Wind.

And then, every lick of trouble he get into, it was the Warrior of God collecting the blame and an even share of the licks.

Brother Lal was usually the one marching down to we house on Taitt Street to give my mother the scoop on what she eight children was doing that day. We did always know he was coming down the street when he start calling out, Sister Ragbir! Sister Ragbir!

That day I was in the yard, repairing a spade for my job with Mr Beharry by the cemetery.

It was a few years now I was working there with Jaikaran and some other boys around All Souls, fixing up the graves for the family and them to light they candle. Something about the slow decomposition of Chaguanas’ dead Anglicans did make the soil like steel and plenty times I did find myself having to replace the handle of my spade.

Around noon, Brother Lal find he way into the yard. He settled he-self on the wooden stool near the half open dutch doors.

‘Sister Ragbir, I had was to tell you!’

And so he start.

While taking he morning constitution round the neighbourhood, he stop at the Invictus Cricket Field to watch an ongoing match. And lo, he see Isaac squatting under the stands, creeping from spot to spot, like if is penny he was gathering up. Is only when Brother Lal stop to wipe he brow, he ketch that Isaac was quietly snatching up the cigarette butts as soon as the livid patrons was dropping them – collecting and then taking a long pull from each.

Mammy face look like somebody smash she head with a Coke bottle.

She thank him, wait for him to leave, then tell me to bring Isaac from the back of the house.

He was there staring into a huge puddle from the rain all the nights before. The water was tea coloured, stained from all the leaves that did continuously fall into it. Isaac’s hair was slick back with a dollop of petroleum jelly, he hand caressing the water, fingers sieving for inky tadpoles.

He touch he chin for a moment, a bristle of adolescent hair now emerging. When I call for him he look up doe-eye at me, but I pull him up rough, and haul him over by he magga shoulders to stand in front of Mammy. I lean against the wall, my ropey arm cross over my chest, waiting for she to let Isaac have it.

Instead she say,

‘Where you was, Gabriel?’

Me? Where I was?

I shoulda know I was coming as God’s warrior again, to protect this wotless child. I coulda lie, is only natural to protect yourself from danger – but I couldn’t manage to lie to my mother.

I confess to liming with Jaikaran. Silence hanging in the air now. Mammy looking up at me, and Isaac gazing down.

I start to explain,

‘Checking out the screen set up for the flim tonight –’

She hand slide down she shin, unhouse a leather slipper from she foot and Wallop! Wallop! I collect two hard slap in my face.

‘Watching them set up a Devil’s Screen!’ she start she bawling. ‘This is why you wasn’t watching the chile!’

I bow down my head, face burning like if a thousand jep now land their stingers on it. She push a hard hand on each one of we shoulder and had we on we knees.

Mammy did not give lecture. She did give sermon.

Describing to us the ways in which the Devil’s influence could leave the screen and pour into the mind of us, the innocent.

The Devil’s House, that was what she did call Jubilee Cinema – a half mile up the road from our house. Sometimes me and Jaikaran would break biche from work and bolt up the road to see the latest flim. Jubilee was a small, smoke-filled theatre, powered by a generator. The cheapest seat we coulda afford was Pit, sitting right in front the screen, you break your neck backwards to see Rita Hayworth tempting Tyrone Power in Blood and Sand. If that was the Devil’s House, then of course the set up in the grounds was call the Devil’s Screen.

Mammy bang she fist on the butcher’s board in place of a pulpit and we was sentenced to memorise Matthew Chapter 4, Verses 1-11. Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. We was to repeat it until she finish cook lunch.

I watch Isaac staring at the ceiling. A small smile creeping on he face.

I watch this boy, his voice turning to a sing-song thing.

I watch, and even though I couldna do it then, I imagine slapping him repeatedly, keeping rhythm with the verse.

Again and again and again. And I just thinking, this boy does get to live he life, and I does have to get punish for it.

Working in the cemetery for Mr. Beharry was gruelling. Twelve o’clock hot sun, sweat like the river of Jordan down your back, you could get delusional like you hearing voices from the graves. Especially on All Souls. Me and Jaikaran never understand how the rain coulda be pouring, and the earth of the grave couldn’t get any softer. New pools of water did erupt under we every day, so we was always dodging them while trying to finish the people wok.

We did also have to watch out for Mr. Beharry’s ill-behaved grey bison – whom he affectionately call Beta. And my God, the man did love the bull like he own son.

But the bison didn’t like nobody, not even Mr. Beharry.

In my mind, taking a page from my mother book, Beta real name was the Devil’s Son.

Beta didn’t want nobody crossing into what he perceive to be he land, walking through them fields near the cemetery. His permanent seat of residence was under the swinging branches of the jamun tree grove, slurping up the fallen berries, his muzzle permanently stained bright violet. Spat out the seeds right on the edge of the deep, deep ravine.

To be honest, nobody want to go near that ravine anyhow. We was lucky we was in the rainy season, it was always full of water, but then Mr. Beharry did tell we, the bodies of them long dead Anglicans does push out, and if you look hard in the dry season, that ravine floor full of bleach-white bones.

Sometimes we would take a little ease up, sitting on the generously broad headstone of Mr Lowen Bullen, ketch kicks on he name. Wondering who Mr Lowen was bulling there in the afterlife.

Where we wanted to be though, was under them jamun trees to ketch a break, but that was Beta liming spot, stretch out and shaded under long, thin boughs of the jamun trees – a massive pile of grey folded flesh, eyes like fire. Snorting out gusts of dust and phlegm, like something out of Stan Jones’s mind, a bison from the Devil’s Herd.

Jaikaran say Beta never properly get break in with the yoke. Instead, he nearly kill the man who try to train him.

Young bison does be out and bad, fierce and strong. Them could release a man from he life easy, easy, unless you break them in. Yoking them to a silk cotton buttress, let him run like the enraged beast he is for an hour or two, until he settle down to the docility of a lamb.

But Beta never settle.

He ploughed through the estate, head drive down low into the ground, scooping men up, throwing them off the crown of his horns. I hear he did pierce one man, and the foot had to cut off from the gangrene. But Jaikaran did tell me, the horn eh so bad, is the tongue that worse. That a bison tongue could lick the flesh off a man, as easy as peeling silk fig. Devil ting, I telling you.

Jaikaran say they was going and slaughter him for beef, but Mr. Beharry couldn’t let that happen, and say he would mind him, keep him as a watchman for the graveyard. And is true.

I never see Beta pull no cart, drag no plough, anyway. The bison’s job was to stare at we. Make sure we wasn’t slacking.

 

–

 

That night, Mammy was protesting – I coulda hear she from the roadside, going on about how they did set up a Devil’s Screen in the middle of Woodford Lodge Cricket Grounds, and how we would all be gazing up at it. And how she didn’t know what would become of the whole Ragbir family after this. But Papa was quick to shut she down.

‘Is something important for Chaguanas!’ he growled, ‘When electricity come, them boys could study in the night, you could read your Bible at any hour. No candles. Me meself, I could work better without straining my eyes in this darkness.’

Mammy face look like a mad baker had knead it into folds.

Papa left with us. Me in the front with my battery powered torch in hand, Papa at the tail with a flambeau.

It did feel like the whole of Chaguanas leave they house to come out and see. Everybody waiting impatient in front this flapping silver screen. The Delco generator finally did get crank up and a brilliant white illuminated us all. The title Fifty Acres bulleted across the screen. The booming voice of a Yankee accent echo over we heads. We was sitting here in Chaguanas in the late evening and, by some kind of magic, we was watching the sun rising over a homestead in a place called Illinois, in Foreign.

My heart was pounding watching men made into giants by the screen, this was nothing like the small screen in Jubilee.

These giants was hoisting electricity poles, tall lamps illuminating the trail from the house to the barn. Huge machines chipping wood, heating up water, streetlights pouring light over the workmen, all marching home at sundown. No burning flambeau over the skin; no torch to suddenly run out of juice.

Then was the glorious scene inside the house.

An electric stove.

Pots and pans, bubbling and simmering on the top. They had a few things cooking at the same time – hot saucy beans, chicken, steaming white rice.

‘Eating everything hot one time,’ my father murmured to we – neck pushed back, face silver in the light. ‘Too bad your mother not here. She woulda like that part.’

Everybody in the audience did love the indoor four-ring electric stove, until the chef put the spoon in he mouth, and put it right back in the pot. Everybody shout out, Oh geed! The chef jutaa the pot!

The final flim was a musical performance by Gogi Grant.

Adorned in a silvery threaded dress, her voice echoing the sound of Isaac’s favourite song. The Wayward Wind.

I could see Isaac shelve between my sisters, face long and bright, mouth parted, eyes wide, enraptured. There was a tender feeling about to bloom inside me, something that had the chance to crescendo into brotherly love. He was just a child after all, slipping off somewhere whenever the opportunity presented itself. He disappeared into it – away from us. The tender feeling evaporated as Isaac started staring into the distance. He was staring at Mr. Beharry, laughing with a beer in he hand, his thick moustache covered in foam, eyes bloodshot. Isaac was watching round cautiously. He make a crawl and slip away from we other siblings.

I see him exit the field through the small iron gate.

And I had to follow him.

Even though evening was softly passing into night, it still had a heat wafting out from the asphalt under my washikong shoes. The pitch-oil flambeaus lined the road and threw my shadow across the walls of cane lining the Woodford Lodge Factory.

I creep up behind Isaac and wallop a hard one to the back of his head. I pull him by the shoulders, turn him round to face me.

‘Where the hell you going?’

Isaac wriggled his shoulder free from my fingers. ‘I wait to see if that Bison could call my name.’

‘Bison? How you mean? Beta?’

Isaac grinned. ‘Is either Brother Lal gone mad or is Mr. Beharry bison he did see that night, standing on two foot, mouth full of gold. I want to see it for meh-self!’

He push off and start to make for the cemetery. I start running after him.

If we retrospecting, like how I doing now, this boy really choose a good night to make a mischief. Every man jack was gathering in that field, and the whole of Chaguanas Main Road was silent, dead. Only the wicked was out here in this hot night.

I see Isaac, jumping the water-logged drain, dropping to all fours in the wet grass, creeping behind the headstones, edging around the puddles.

‘Aye, aye! Yuh ass! Get back here!’ I call out in a harsh whisper.

He laugh and continue to crawl towards the silhouette of the jamun trees, branches long like tendrils, fluttering leaves edging each one. Within the base of the grove, I could see it, a slow heaving, large, black mass blocking the soft glow of the half moon.

I watch Isaac scrape he-self across the reddish-brown dirt of the graveyard, so near to the beast. I lunge at him and all I collect in my hand is the warm night air. He roll away from me, and into the darkness of the Jamun grove, and all I coulda hear was my own voice asking me,

Why it is I must get blame for this too?

‘GO AHEAD AND KILL YUHSELF THEN!’

My shout arouse the black mass, and it start to rise up. With a massive tremble of its flesh, it shake off the graveyard dust from the folds of its wrinkled grey skin.

I throw meh-self against the gravestone. I could hear the muffled snorting, but it was only when I throw the light of the torch I did see.

Beta there like a behemoth over Isaac, hooves digging rough into the hard earth, horned head tossing rabidly from side to side, thick foam flying out from his mouth.

Isaac’s chest was pinned under its front right hoof, his hands around its hock, trying to pull the hoof off.

He shouting something, but I was trembling so much, I drop the torch.

The light continue to shine on them as Beta bellowed – loud, deep, the pitch so low, it reverberating in my bones. He lower he muzzle over Isaac, thick white saliva gush into every orifice of Isaac’s face, his eyes, nose, his open screaming mouth.

And it was like Jaikaran had said, with the dragging of the tongue – He Will Laugh – his once smiling face was being torn into bloody shreds of skin and flesh.

Isaac’s scream went higher, like baby now born. No, like a small animal being gutted.

I cover my ears. I cover my eyes.

Not for this too, not for this too, I was whispering.

The sound of something dragging in the dirt.

Then, the splash beyond the jamun grove, beyond the graveyard. The ravine where the bones of old, dead Anglicans longed to push free.

The screaming stop.

I start to run out of the graveyard, slip in a puddle of water, and hit my head on the gravestone of Mr Lowen Bullen.

A faint presence of rain drawing lines down my muddy face when I wake. The earth and my blood congeal over my forehead and my eyes. When I stagger into the main road, I could smell the rain as it beat the warm asphalt, a soft mist curling above it. Through the drizzle, I see a hundred flambeaux coming towards me like a firestorm. Like the whole of Chaguanas looking for we. Within the crowd, I find my father, his face crumpled with the deep exhaustion that only comes when hope is lost at night. Eyes wet, red rims and wide, his mouth too, open wide and a low moan that has no beginning nor end, it goes up and down like the drawn out note of a hymn. But it never end.

‘Look he dey!’ Is Brother Lal, shouting and pointing.

Mammy push through the crowd, her face like stone.

Before words could come out, it was clout after clout. Her hands on my head, my neck, my arms. I let her do it, and I wonder if she will bless me with darkness again, but she suddenly pull back, breathless, sweat leaking down her throat. Somebody holding her back, not my father.

I cough. ‘We have to go to the graveyard and look for Isaac.’

My voice cracking, weak. I let myself collapse to the ground, scraping the warm, wet asphalt with my hands. Mammy stare down at me, I could see now it was a church sister holding her. I didn’t have no words, it didn’t have nothing there.

My mind wasn’t working right, but my mouth did start to forge a truth Mammy would listen to.

‘It was the bison,’ I say, looking up at the faces crowding over me. ‘The bison with the mouth full of gold. It was bellowing he name – he Christian name. And . . .  And he went to it.’

Whispers start shooting through the crowd like arrows carrying all my lies so quickly, I coulda never take them back.

‘Gabriel, this is what you see?’ Her voice was calm.

‘And he call he-self, the Devil’s Son,’ I muttered over and over. ‘He call he-self the Devil’s Son, he call he-self the Devil’s Son . . .’

The inferno of flambeau troop through the streets of Chaguanas. Every narrow road, alleyway, drain, no matter how shallow. Where there was darkness, a flaming rag found its way and devoured it. Revealing nothing, no trace, no Isaac.

The rain started pouring harder – reflecting orange against the fire of the flambeau. A horde of men descend upon the graveyard. I go with them, and Pa remains, the rain mix with his tears. There was a call for more pitch-oil, more rags, more rods. They illuminated the headstones, the red earth of the cemetery. Through the sheets of pouring water, I see the jamun grove, the branches torn away, the hoof prints under it.

Beyond, the thrashing water of the ravine turning wild, flowing away from us, away from me.

I watch and wonder if it did channel my sin down to the swamp where it would sleep for all the years to come.

The water around our ankles start to pool and the men cannot resuscitate each flambeau in time as the rain did worsen and storm upon we. The search for Isaac and Beta come to an end.

In the morning, the constable come, and the next day Mammy prepare for a service to be done in Isaac name. Then ten days of nightly prayer for his soul. Prayer to weaken the Devil’s hold on my brother. Prayer for some kind of release, some kind of sign.

The rains fall for days, and eventually everybody was ready to give up. Rescue party turn into recovery party to at least find a body.

Papa did continue to search for life. He hold on to me, wild eyes, grip my shoulders, asking: Did I ever call out Isaac’s name while I worked in the cemetery? Was Beta ever looking at Isaac when he walk past? Did I ever hear Beta speak before?

Had I ever seen his mouth open wide enough to show teeth glittering like gold?

Eventually Beta turn up again, once more taking he rightful place under the shade of the swinging jamun branches, consuming all the fallen berries, face still stain bright violet.

Papa took this as his own sign and told Mr. Beharry he had to cut Beta open, and there he would find his son in the belly. But Mr. Beharry did protest; call police on Papa.

Papa did not leave the house again.

Yet did not turn to drink.

He stopped working and then find he-self in the church.

Then, regular pilgrimage to the Mount, to light a black candle on Mr. Beharry head – Let it fall down dead! Let the beast, the Devil’s Son, split open and come bounding out, Isaac! Papa withers, wails and I could no longer bring myself to look at him or admire him.

One night, I steal away, like if my name is Iscariot, fold myself into the darkness and run deep in the south lands. I become an apprentice of the black gold we call oil and for 43 years I live in successful amnesia in the heart of Pointe-A-Pierre.

But now in the traffic, the haunting voice of Gogi Grant start to creep up, start to claw up into my own flesh and make me remember everything.

If I return to Chaguanas, would I go in the dry season?

If I look in the bare ravine, would I find him?

Would I find Isaac, find him as a boy, never age, standing there whole and complete, laughing back me?

Or would I find him – skin then fascia, nerves and tendon, flesh and fat, then the bare bones – all licked clean by the most corrosive of all elements, the tongue of Beta?

Beta, the one who bellows and vomits fire, eyes bloodshot, this lost bison still looking for its master.

And I, his brother in debauchery, aren’t I also the lost son of the Devil’s own herd?

I push the power button. I cut Gogi’s voice into silence.

The light turns green. The palm of my hand rotates the steering wheel.

I guide my car down the San Fernando Bypass, towards my home."

When a group of male dogs chased after a female, the locals called it ‘mounting the trellis’.

The males darted this way and that, forgetting food and drink in their single-minded frenzy for females, running around in the chaos of battle.

The earth had thawed, and their paws were thick with mud.

They clawed and bit each other, fighting over a bitch. As soon as one male had the upper hand, the pack abruptly stopped moving. The losers reluctantly shuffled aside and slunk away.

The rutting dogs spent a long time stuck together.

This was the moment that the educated youths chose to come running, shouting with their sticks raised, chasing after the fleeing dogs as if they were a man and woman engaged in improper behaviour, until the dogs uncoupled.

 

Isat at the entrance to our tent, scraping mud off my shoes with a stone, listening to the cries of men and dogs.

‘It’s springtime! Just like that, taken over by heat and madness . . .’

 

RABBITS

In the sixties and seventies, high-school students from cities across China were rounded up, labelled ‘educated youths’, and sent to desolate farmlands in the border regions to be reformed through labour. Over 2,000 educated youths gathered at the reservoir and a pair of rabbits (as gay men were known in the local slang) were hauled up onstage, bound hand and foot. When one of them struggled, he was knocked to the ground with a hoe, and didn’t stand again.

From the audience came thunderous cries of ‘Beat the wicked! Down with this nastiness!’

Whether it was a man and a woman, two men, two women, two dogs or two cats, as long as there was a whiff of sex in the air, everyone got incredibly worked up and started screaming attack slogans.

 

Qiao had been pent up for too long. He assaulted other people to release his feelings. He told me once that the whole time, he was mentally beating himself up. ‘Hey, keep a hold of yourself. If you think about that sort of thing, you’ll end up getting attacked too.

‘You have to keep it in. Endure, endure. Don’t let anything happen, or you’ll end up dead.

‘Beat them, go on, beat them to death. Harder!’

 

In springtime, there was blood everywhere.

 

WORKPLACE INJURY

 

The Harbin educated youth Big Eyes stood at the doorway of the barber shop, pointing at the upper bunk in the back room and quietly telling everyone who passed by, ‘Xu Dahuan is in there nursing a “workplace injury”. Ha! She was doing it with the Third Brigade Leader on a desk at the primary school, and they got caught in the act. Goddamn it! Of all places, the primary school! Kids go there!’

He was full of glee, using ‘workplace injury’ to refer to such an act.

 

The Third Brigade Leader was a local. In the days after he was caught, his wife cooked three meals a day and brought them to him. When they saw each other, she didn’t utter one word against him, but kept cursing her love rival as a nasty little vixen. Being female, it was better for her to rebuke the other woman.

The two of them were locked up for a few days, then they were released and that was that.

At the next assembly, the Branch Leader was obliged to say a few words to the young people from the cities. ‘Before you educated youths arrived, we had quite a few of these incidents. Just a squabble between two families, no big deal.

‘It’s forty below in the winter, really harsh, the sun goes down so early, and there’s no electricity. Two people hear each other breathe, groping through the dark to speak . . . You know? Do you know what I mean?’

 

FANG SI’ER

Fang Si’er was a child of Logistics HQ and Jiang Yong grew up in the Navy Compound. Military brats like them always went around in senior officers’ uniforms belonging to their elders, to show off that their parents had been high-ranking back in the day.

Fang Si’er came to Third Brigade from the fields, on a tractor, covered in dirt.

Whenever he came into view within a crowd, it brought to mind Mao’s 1957 address at Moscow University, where he told the Chinese overseas students, ‘The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours. You young people, full of vigour and vitality, are in the bloom of life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you.’

They were Pushkin, they were Nekhlyudov, they were the Brothers Karamazov, dazzling in the sunlight. They were the elite.

 

At Third Brigade, he ran into Big Ni in the bathroom. The two of them had gotten into a fight in the fields when they first arrived. This time round, they both looked a little startled as they brushed past each other. No more fighting. That’s how it is; if you don’t start brawling within that first second, it’s not going to happen.

The news spread among the men: Fang Si’er had come to Third Brigade. He was well known among the 20,000 educated youths on this farm as the sort of person who raised a plume of dust walking down the street.

At noon, the military brats of Third Brigade took him to lunch. They asked what he was doing here, but he wouldn’t say.

Afterwards, it started raining heavily, and he looked out the window.

Jiang Yong came to the men’s dorm, a raincoat draped over her head.

Fang Si’er went out. Huddled beneath the same raincoat, beneath the watchful eyes of over 300 educated youths staring from the dorm windows, they walked together to the feed store by the stables, went inside, and shut the door behind them.

We all knew exactly what they were doing in there. Fuck it! Couldn’t they at least try to hide it? They were meant to be the elite! The sun at eight or nine in the morning!

We couldn’t see what they were doing, which made all the men uneasy that rainy day.

‘Maybe they’re just chatting.’

‘Fuck you. Coming all this way for a chat? Why not say they’re discussing political ideologies?’

Over an hour later, they stepped out again into the downpour.

Jiang Yong was blushing so deeply we could see it through the rain.

 

Back at the Third Brigade dorm, Fang Si’er grabbed Ling Qiusheng’s leftover noodles.

He slurped them ever so loudly.

From his sickbed, Ling Qiusheng sat up and asked, ‘. . . Did you do it?’

Fang Si’er didn’t answer, simply ate his noodles.

Ling Qiusheng: ‘. . . Come on, tell us.’

Everyone crowded over, listening eagerly.

Fang Si’er finished the noodles, drank the broth, and lit a cigarette. He smoked and smoked.

Everyone wanted to know.

After a long while, wreathed in smoke, he said, ‘There are some things . . . You can do them, but you can’t talk about them.’

As he spoke these words, the rain stopped. He went outside and drove back to the fields.

 

‘He really was a shining sun . . .’

 

HYSTERISM

1. Washing His Sheets

Two years after we were sent to the Great Northern Waste, we started hearing about hysterical women.

The first was a woman in the Machinery Unit, from Tianjin – a large-boned, sturdy type in her twenties. Whenever she spoke to a man, even about the most mundane subjects, her words brimmed with emotion and her gaze was passionate, leaving everyone she talked to uncomfortable.

One day, she walked into the Arts Troupe’s male dorm in order to wash the bedding of handsome Liu Fusheng.

He gaped at her. ‘My sheets aren’t dirty.’

And yet she insisted on pulling them off his bunk and walking off with them.

In the dormitory courtyard, she began work with much fanfare. First the quilt had to be removed from its cover. Then she went to fetch some water and splash, the sheets were soaking in a tub. Next she strung up the cotton padding and bashed it with a wooden pole, pak pak. Finally, she put a washboard into the tub. Sitting astride a small stool, she grabbed a corner of a sheet, soaped it, and energetically scrubbed it, krssh krssh.

Everyone, men and women, watched from the windows.

She scrubbed with such force that all the filth Fusheng had left on his bedding was washed clean away.

Fusheng gawped at her. ‘Fuck! What the hell is this?’ Feeling hard done by, he lay on the bare boards of his bunk, unable to go on watching.

After the sheets and blankets had been thoroughly cleansed, she rinsed them a few times. No one came to help, so she painstakingly wrung them out herself, those long swathes of fabric. She shook them open and hung them up to dry.

A woman walked over and sneered, ‘Who are you washing those for?’

She didn’t try to hide it. ‘For Fusheng.’

‘Are they dirty?’

‘Not really.’

‘Why wash them, then?’

‘If you wait till they’re truly dirty, it’s too late. You’ll never get them clean.’

 

By evening, the sheets were dry. She placed the cotton padding back into the cover, sewed it shut, folded it neatly, and as if hugging a beloved person, delivered it into the men’s dorm, her face full of delight.

Fusheng, who had been lying on his bare bunk all day, took them from her with a murmured ‘Thanks’. Then he turned away from her.

After this, she’d come to the dorm every evening and call from the doorway, ‘Is Fusheng there? Is he in?’ If no one answered her, she’d go on shouting.

Fusheng endured this for a fortnight, then asked for leave to go back to Beijing.

In his absence, she began grabbing other men’s bedding to wash. In order to guard their sheets, the men took to locking their dorm during the day, even if there was someone inside.

When she couldn’t get her hands on anything to wash, she’d pound on the door, raising a huge racket. Her friends from Tianjin couldn’t bear to see her like this. They came and said to us, ‘Just let her wash your sheets if she wants. It’s therapeutic.’

This was the first time I heard of this condition, hysterism.

 

Her illness got worse and worse. She went around with her hair dishevelled, blushing whenever she saw a man, muttering something lovelorn. A truly pathetic state of affairs.

The local bachelor quickly got wind of this. He stopped her in the street and invited her back to his shack for a meal. She went with him, and her Tianjin friends had to run after her to bring her back.

That night, the Tianjin educated youths had a meeting. First, they set up a rota for the women to take turns to watch her. Next, they wrote a letter to her family, which they all signed.

Her parents hurried there, and when they saw the state of their daughter, they bundled her back to Tianjin without another word.

The local bachelor said, ‘Hysterism is just lovesickness. You young people don’t understand. Only marriage can cure this disease.’

 

2. Little Chilli

 

The Beijing educated youth known as Little Chilli was in Seventh Brigade. She was tall and slender, with a spicy temperament.

One of the symptoms of hysterism was writing a man’s name over and over on the same sheet of paper even after it was full, stacking the name high, layers and rows of them, oceans and mountains of man.

My name appeared on one of these, as ‘Moon Over Mountains’ – the title of a song I performed onstage that subsequently became my nickname.

On a sheet of paper, Little Chilli wrote over and over, Moon Over Mountains, Moon Over Mountains, Moon Over Mountains . . .

Someone told me, ‘Little Chilli from Seventh Brigade has you on her mind. She covered a piece of paper with your nickname.’

I had no idea what to say to that.

For some time afterwards, I tried to work out what kind of news this was: I was nineteen years old, and a woman I’d never seen before, more than thirty kilometres away, had grown fond of me. I’d never met her. I didn’t know what she looked like. Would I like her if we met? But she liked me. At the age of nineteen, a woman being fond of you, poring over your nickname, writing you out again and again . . . What could be more precious than that? This was glory! A medal for a nineteen-year-old to proudly pin to his chest! Isn’t this how a man lives his entire life?

I began to grow happy. Here was the taste of love and being loved!

I decided I would write a poem and bring it to Little Chilli at Seventh Brigade. I would accept her feelings in person, and express my own.

Before I could write the poem, unfortunate news arrived: Little Chilli was madly in love with an educated youth from Beijing, the tall and silent man known as ‘Housefly’, who’d grown up in Zhongguancun, where the Science Institute was.

This was all too sudden. I hadn’t even stepped onstage, and already the curtain was coming down? What the hell! Couldn’t this have waited a little?

 

Aguy from Seventh Brigade came and told me the pair of them were running off every night to the grain store in the threshing field, where they got it on. Little Chilli was radiant, more beautiful than she’d ever been. As for Housefly, the big man had plunged deep into the obsession and exhaustion of love.

It was as if Dulcinea had voluntarily given herself to Quixote without a hint of reluctance, without a coquettish refusal, without any preamble or poetry or play-acting. Does love like this have any meaning? Do the pair of you mean anything?

You wrote my name over and over, but you didn’t carve it into your heart.

The Seventh Brigade Bro told me she’d written many men’s names, and I was just one among them. His words made my medal throb. I looked down and saw instead a great scar on my shrivelled chest.

I said, ‘A scar! That’s the true medal of a nineteen-year-old.’

 

The Seventh Brigade Bro said:

They were copulating in the grain store every day, so of course some of the harvest got damaged.

Finally, the Brigade Leader couldn’t stand it any more, and criticised them during assembly, in front of over 200 people. ‘Imagine doing this sort of thing in the grain store. Seed scattered across the floor. Dogs only mount the trellis in February and August, cats are only in heat once a year, so why do humans need to do it every day? Haven’t you had enough? Do the two of you even have time to think about Revolution? You educated youths came to the Great Northern Waste in order to be reformed, not to make babies. There are plenty of us locals to do the baby-making! You’re destroying the grain day after day.’

The local bachelor heard about this and quipped, ‘It sure sounds like a lot of seed got spilled!’

Everyone burst out laughing.

Little Chilli heard the joke and laughed along with everyone else.

Housefly sat expressionless. He always was a quiet person, tender and steadfast.

One of the locals said, ‘Sir, they don’t go every day. They’re not there today, for instance.’ And everyone burst out laughing again.

 

After the assembly, Little Chilli and Housefly didn’t return to the dorm. As usual, they headed for the grain store.

The meeting had taken up their lovemaking time, and now they couldn’t wait to get moving. The educated youths of Seventh Brigade watched them in disappointment.

Much of the time, romantic couples got separated by political criticism and shame. Little Chilli and Housefly were unmoved. They stayed together, and eventually they went back to Beijing, where they got married.

 

Many years later, at a reunion for the educated youths of the Great Northern Waste, I saw Little Chilli for the first time in years. She’d put on more weight than I’d expected and was still beautiful. When I saw her, she was saying to a group of women, ‘It’s been more than twenty years, and we’re just as in love as when we first met.’

Hearing these words sapped my courage, and I didn’t go over to say hello to her.

She was showing off! But what could be worth bragging about more?

There’s a time for everything. At the age of twenty, when a herd of oxen couldn’t hold you back, that’s when you fall in love, even if that means going against the political slogans of the time.

As a young man, I wanted to learn how to love, but in the end, I did nothing. I wanted to torture myself, but didn’t know where to begin."

    "text": "Where the path cuts left, a black caterpillar was on the ground – on the move. It looked wooly and prickly and propelled itself with speed.

I picked up a dry leaf, and when the caterpillar climbed aboard, I carried the leaf to the safety of the grass and set it down at the base of a tree.

A man had stopped to watch me. When I straightened with a satisfied expression, the man was there, ready to pop my balloon. He pointed and said, They’re everywhere – but what he meant was, What’s the use?

And I saw that, ahead, caterpillars charged the path in mass, away from the trees, toward the busy road, all hellbent, it seemed, on the same obscure destination.

Who was I to tell them otherwise?

I thought of the traffic-directing hummingbird who likes to bully cars at the corner of Kirby and Bellwether. Stop! I could say to the runners, bikers, dog-walkers and stroller-pushers who rolled up. Watch your step!

But the man – this bald killjoy – was still watching me, and seemed to interpret my hesitation as interest in his sex.

Go on, I said to myself. I put one foot in front of the other.

I passed a person walking a small pig on a jeweled leash. When a jogger flew by, a drop of his sweat landed on my lip. Along an iron rail, a woman scraped shit from her shoe with a stick. In the path-people’s faces and postures were expressions of ownership and isolation – All of this is mine! – Get out of my way! – and as usual, I was thinking about what I wanted, too: silk trousers, calfskin mules, gold chains – geraniums in Gainey pots – nice cheese and a bottle of Lambrusco – a comfortable couch – a comfortable house – a comfortable life.

At the end of the path – or anyway, at the place where I typically turn around – a child-sized car, wheels askew, was abandoned. lvnlrg, said the car’s vanity plates.

Across the street, a man blasted spent white blossoms into massive dirt-plumes with the gas-powered blower strapped to his back.

The municipal trash bin smelled like a corpse.

The lake looked like a pewter platter.

When I returned to where the path cuts right, the crushed caterpillars were dirt-dulled and disfigured by the orange gut-bubbles that oozed from them. I stopped to look and was roughly shoulder-checked, without apology or acknowledgment, by a half-naked youth.

Then I spotted a lone figure, traveling. She was headed toward a patch of pigweed, which thrives in disturbed areas.

When fully extended, the caterpillar’s shape is that of the bold I – the first person – the mark of one who devours in order to transform herself.

    "text": "Ihad decided to allow my grandmother to take me shopping. Her campaign to go shopping with me had been unrelenting since I was two, around the time I announced I was finished going in my pants and wanted to learn about what happened in the toilet. Her desire to march me around department stores was so strong that she ended most phone calls with a reminder that I was a teenager with a body like a clothes hanger and that it was cruel and unusual not to let her, a short busty woman with a love of fashion and a waistline like a soda can, dress me.

I rarely let her take me shopping for two reasons. One: if I did, I had to take the train from New York to the suburbs of Philadelphia so I could spend the weekend browsing at a department store called Boscov’s, which sounded more like a type of chocolate-milk syrup than a store, and sold things made out of synthetic materials that looked like clothes for a suicidal-depression-themed Barbie. The other, much more important reason, was that she always managed to turn these shopping sessions into weekend-long summits on my hair, my relationships, my grammar and my future life prospects. Even if I did go, it was never just the shopping. Entreaties would be made: I needed to stay longer so she could take me to see the sculpture garden, the symphony orchestra. It would be expensive, but it would be worth it to teach her nail-biting heathen of a granddaughter something about life.

Planning my life was one of her life’s great joys. For a period she thought I should be a lawyer, like her husband, my Pop-Pop, but then sometimes she would get annoyed with him, and by extension the entire legal profession, and so she would decide I was too good to be a lawyer. Whenever that happened she remembered that everyone in her mother’s family had been a doctor, except her mother who was forced to be a nurse because of sexism, so I should be a doctor to right the wrongs against my great-grandma. The evidence was incontrovertible. I was in AP Biology. I was becoming a doctor. Then one day when I was in tenth grade she saw a science ethicist with fantastic hair on one of the cable morning TV shows. Of course, science ethics was my calling because it married the two passions she’d decided I had, law and biology.

Oh! Sweetheart! You’ve got to see this woman. She was so ELEGANT! she said after I finally picked up the landline at my parents’ house.

My brother and I usually screened her with caller ID because we knew that if we answered and it was Grandmom we’d never be able to do even a third of our homework before dinner. She mandated at least forty-five minutes on the phone, not as an official rule, just in practice. If you had to hang up she would say just hold on a minute in a way that was something between a command and a plea and so completely disarming that it never failed to get you across the forty-five-minute mark.

Once I actually answered, it was easy for me to spend hours talking to her on the phone, and clearly other people felt this way; her conversation was in high demand. Every once in a while she’d say hold on, don’t go away and put you on hold to tell Lorna or Edith or whoever had called her for some entertainment or advice that she was on the phone with her granddaughter and absolutely not to be disturbed. I’d hear the click of the phone line switching back to me and she’d say something like, anyway, her mother wasn’t as dumb as everyone thought she was. And boy was she built. But she had a horrible death. She was decapitated in a car accident. I can’t believe I can’t remember her name. This was always much better than my homework.

Even though I saw my grandma nine or ten times a year for the Jewish, American, and made-up holidays that we celebrated, apparently I never saw her. All my friends’ granddaughters come over every day after school, she would tell me as I was trying to write my lab report about the Krebs cycle. They bake cookies together and listen to classical music. I told her this was such an obviously fake thing for grandmothers to do with their grandchildren that I knew it was a lie. And even if it weren’t, I’d say, would you really want to have a granddaughter in high school who goes and bakes cookies with her grandmother every weekend? Appeals to normalcy always worked. She was all for anything we could do to be on the high end of normal. Her main aspiration was fitting in, but with a little extra.

Her own mother had bought her the nicest clothes they could afford in the hope she would stand out in the right way at the very best public girls’ school in Philadelphia. She was always remembered at reunions, she said, as the girl with incredible, tailor-made outfits, even though she grew up in a ramshackly multifamily in South Philadelphia, not on the Main Line like the rest of her cohort. Which was why, as an adult, she tormented my mother in the 1970s by making her wear pink cat-eye glasses and mustard-yellow, coordinated bell-bottom sets straight out of Mademoiselle magazine. My mother’s outfits didn’t have a similar effect on her classmates.

One afternoon in January, when I was sixteen, I was on the phone with my grandma and we were discussing the differences between Martha Stewart and the Barefoot Contessa’s recipe styles – the Contessa has a heavier hand with the oil, which explains the obvious difference in their appearances. My defenses were weak because it was winter break and I was bored and everyone from school had gone on various vacations while I was stuck at home watching my brother play video games, and so, without thinking too much about it, I agreed to take the train down and go shopping with her.

When I got to her house I remembered why this was something I didn’t do. I was presented with a three-ring binder full of photographs of female celebrities torn from magazines that I was forced to peruse as a sort of vision board of doom. The binder had separate tabs for me, my mother and my aunt. In my tab were J. Crew ads, pictures of Gwyneth Paltrow, and women with Republicanly thick blonde blowouts wearing cable-knit Ralph Lauren sweaters. Your hair looks like it’s been caught in a Mixmaster, she said the moment I arrived, grabbing my tangles and assaulting me with a brush.

I had agreed to come on the condition that we skipped Boscov’s. I had a suspicion dating back to early childhood that the gray-brown carpet was a sort of primordial soup from which the hideous gray-brown clothing on offer emerged. It used to give me visions of mottled wool rising up from the floor and racks and ensconcing me in a scratchy full-body tube sock. Instead we were going to a consignment store where the rich ladies like her friend Marlene Silverberg – who had great taste – sold their designer-brand clothing.

We were whipping around in my grandma’s massive silver Toyota, traversing her neighborhood made of near-identical houses, all constructed in the late sixties from a set of four plans that differed only in window, door and garage placement. We passed a few that looked exactly like hers, which she said was Plan B, the most elegant plan. Even I had to concede hers looked the best, with her elaborate landscaping of the standard suburban front yard, which she referred to unironically as the grounds. We were sipping our chocolate-flavored water ice, when she rolled her sleeve up and showed me a Band-Aid on her right forearm.

Remember how I had a disgusting brown spot here?

I didn’t.

Well I went to the dermatologist and he said it was nothing.

I was glad.

No, wait.

She swerved slightly into the shoulder of the road whenever she spoke because of her need to make eye contact with me.

So then I went to another dermatologist and she said I shouldn’t worry about it.

I was glad.

And then I still had a funny feeling about it because it was a raised brown spot, so I told her she should biopsy it, and she said she wouldn’t. So I went back to the normal dermatologist and said he should biopsy it and he did it.

So you won?

Hold on hold on – guess what?

She looked at me with her enormous, almost bulging blue eyes.

Thank God it was cancer!

She turned to me and smiled her big, winning smile. People always say that old people begin to look like children, but there was something so girlish about my grandma that I’d never noticed before. Her strawberry-blonde bob framed her full cheeks and her front two teeth were slightly longer than the rest, which gave her the appearance of a cartoon bunny. She wasn’t really looking at the road, and people were honking at us because she was drifting into the right lane whenever she turned to look at me. I estimated a 30 percent chance we were going to die in the car, but I didn’t mind because I was laughing uncontrollably. I repeated thank God it was cancer back to her as a question.

Yes, thank God I was right it was cancer and I made them check so that they got it off.

So you’re happy you have cancer?

Well I don’t have it anymore, they burned it off. And now I have an unsightly wound.

We got out at a strip mall with a kosher deli and a nail salon and a dollar store with a piece of printer paper that said or more in Comic Sans taped up next to the dollar. Next door was the consignment store with a jaunty sign written in loopy cursive and a mannequin with a fusty pink tweed skirt-suit in the window. I followed my grandma in and resigned myself to the suffering to come, which I knew was a part of life on Earth.

Shopping was generally a not fun thing for me. The girls at my school wore a uniform of riding boots, down puffer vests and a specific brand of black yoga leggings. At one point I considered adopting this uniform, but my mom said she would not pay the 100-dollar price of the yoga leggings. She said I clearly lived in a different tax bracket than she did and that I could get normal yoga leggings at one-tenth the cost. Obviously the point of those specific yoga leggings was that they were 100 dollars, so that left me nowhere. I didn’t even like how they looked, or much else about the girls in my school, but I still desired their approval for obvious reasons documented in all films and media about teenagers.

I wasn’t against fashion; I wasn’t one of those people who need to make it into a whole statement about their intellect. On Thursdays I swiped the Styles section from the newspaper on my way to school. But of course I didn’t really have the occasion to wear runway fashion in the tenth grade. Also those clothes cost much more than the yoga leggings.

Instead, shopping meant meandering with my mom around big stores in SoHo full of millions of random things, both of us feeling lost and frightened. I hadn’t even learned about hating my body yet and I still felt that way. We watched other mother-daughter duos in the store move about as if they had a purpose, fawning over tunics and accessories and selecting items decisively for one another as if this were an arena guided by logic and order rather than weariness and confusion. It could sometimes get very bad, like when my mom held up some item as a suggestion for me to try on and I said, Do you expect me to take advice from someone wearing a dress that ugly? Her dress wasn’t even that ugly. It would take a good half-hour of not speaking to each other from across the store to recover. We usually left with tops with big personalities and skirts I was convinced could be the secret to my new life, and then I continued wearing jeans and my dad’s overlarge sweaters to school.

My grandmother held up a navy pinstripe suit with big shoulder pads and said, Oh that is beauuuutiful in the grave and rapturous tone she used indiscriminately to refer to an oil painting or a particularly good tuna sandwich.

Where am I wearing that?

To school.

I’m not wearing a suit to school.

Why not?

I’ll look insane.

No you’ll look beauuuutiful. Like Katharine Hepburn. You should wear these things now before your breasts get too big.

I looked down at my chest and couldn’t understand what she was talking about. I had been waiting to grow this thing for years.

We could give it to Mommy, I said. She’d have more use for it than me.

Than I –

Than you what?

She was now using her fancy-diction transatlantic voice. No. The proper grammar is – she has more use for it than I. Don’t they teach you anything at that school?

You want me to speak like I’m in some kind of Shakespeare thing?

Her thin, strawberry-blonde eyebrows scurried up her face.

Shakespeare thing? What’s wrong with you pussycat? You should always speak the correct way even if other people don’t. You’re better than other people.

She thrust the suit at me and I stumbled through the synthetic satin curtain into the fitting room.

Most girls, I felt, had some guidance about shopping from their mothers, but mine had no interest in it. She had a lot of black clothing that made her look like a Left Bank intellectual who works on an organic farm. I mean this in a nice way – she looked like she didn’t care too much about her appearance, but was still attractive and strong. Aside from the Theory suit she bought with much fanfare to testify at a congressional hearing for work, every garment simply entered her life. They just appeared in her drawers and then on her body for all time. She wore sweaters her sister left at our house, a few tops her friend didn’t want anymore, and because I was taller than her by the time I left elementary school, most of the jeans I’d worn since the age of ten.

The girls at my school had mothers that gave them hand-me-down designer clothing – my friend’s mom took pity on me once and gave me an Agnès B bateau-neck top. With my mother I was always doing hand-me-ups. I understood why she hated shopping so much. It wasn’t that she thought it was frivolous, or judged women who spent lots of money and time on their clothes. She was scared of shopping. Even in a downtown boutique full of asymmetrical tunics or whatever, the kind of place my grandma would never go, my mom still felt her mother’s shadow following her around and saying on you, that blouse would have nothing to recommend it.

But grandparents don’t loom quite as large in the psyche as parents. Parents are your jailers, your tormenters and your superegos; they control your access to food and shelter and a curfew after 11 p.m. Grandparents are kindly benefactors who ply you with candy and presents in exchange for attention and kisses. They’ve already exhausted their energy trying to perfect your parents, it’s not your problem.

There was no mirror in the dressing room so I had to emerge for inspection. When I pushed through the silky curtains there were four women huddled around my grandma expectantly, one who had accidentally dyed her hair purple with the shampoo that removes yellow from white hair. My great-grandmom used to do that when I was little and I thought it was natural, like it was a hair color people were born with in the olden times that didn’t exist anymore.

UGH! You look GORGEOUS! Didn’t I tell you she was the full package? Come here just a sec let me fix you. THAT BODY!

My grandma, who was more or less a foot shorter than me, straightened the waist on the trousers, which were just above her eye level. She spent a long time preening around the lapels and smoothing my hair down. She was always petting me and my brother as if we were her pets but I never realized the extent to which she herself was like a tabby cat – her reddish hair, her mercurial temper, and of course her desire to clean her offspring. I looked at myself in the mirror. I resembled a 1980s talk-show host, but I didn’t mind. I felt like two little boys inside a suit to make an adult, though not exactly the kind of adult I imagined myself becoming. I guess I made some kind of negative face.

You don’t like it?

I like it but I don’t want it.

Oh you’re a fool.

No really, I don’t want it.

When you’re my age you’ll wish you could go back and never take that off! You look like Grace Kelly but even TALLER!

The chorus of old ladies came to fawn over me, and while I managed to escape back into the dressing room, my grandma basked in the compliments about her tall blonde granddaughter. Yes she gets her height from her father! We drove home empty-handed, my grandma lamenting our suitlessness the whole way home.

When we arrived at her house, the only Plan B on the street, my Pop-Pop was outside using a leaf blower to clear out the grounds. He was standing under the oak tree next to a koi pond that my grandma had begged my Pop-Pop to dig into the grass, but which only ever held fish for one spring in the early 2000s. I turned to approach him, expecting to be grilled about my performance in history class or about his two great loves, Winston Churchill and the US Civil War, but my grandma dragged me away as usual because as we all knew I belonged to her.

We went through the kitchen to the den, which she had transformed, over the course of her fifty years in the house, into a Louis Quinze-style salon, and down into the basement. The dankness of the basement made me uneasy – there are certain smells one doesn’t experience growing up in the city – and my eyes began to itch. I had already spent six hours as my grandmother’s captive, and I knew that after whatever she needed me to do in the basement there would be a mandatory screening of the film Gigi in what was once my mother’s room and was now an all-white mausoleum for cherub statuettes.

I paused at the bottom of the staircase. For some reason I had thought coming to my grandmother’s would afford me more personal space, but now I longed to be locked in my tiny bedroom as my brother and his friends consumed an entire ice-cream cake while playing video games about murdering people and my mom talked on the phone so loudly one wondered if she wouldn’t be better served just yelling out to whoever she was trying to contact. I could say I was too tired to watch the film, go upstairs after my tuna hoagie, and savor sleep’s respite until it was time to go home – but I knew that would mean my entire visit didn’t count, and my grandma would call demanding the completion of our date for the next few months. She seemed to sense I was thinking of ways to escape because she suddenly gripped my wrist, digging into me with her long painted fingernails.

Just hold on a minute, I just want to see something –

She fished around on a rolling rack full of clothes with dividers marked with my mom’s name, my aunt’s, my uncle’s, until she reached the marker that said mine, pulled out a gray garment bag and unzipped it. Inside was a black dress, made from a sort of swishy suiting material. It was short, sleeveless and simple.

Here, you little brat – in reality she used her special name for people she loves, but I won’t tell it.

I changed out of my clothes, careful to remain standing on top of my sneakers so I didn’t touch the cold basement floor. My grandma carefully put the dress over my head and zipped me into it slowly. It closed exactly over my waist, then the zipper snaked up my back until the dress fastened perfectly over my bust. The rigid material fit every contour of my body, as if it were spandex that had stretched to cover me, but it was inflexible and secure. I looked in the mirror and saw her small form behind me. The dress would have been knee-length on her but it ended in the middle of my thigh. I followed her directive to spin around. I let my feet touch the cold basement floor and the hem of the dress fluttered. I suppressed a smile. She grinned.

Just as I suspected.

    "text": "Two weeks before I lost my home, I found a coat hanging in the attic. It was a large coat of pilled gray wool, worn out from years of use.

The coat was not mine. The coat did not belong to the man who lived with me. I held it and thought, How? If this had been a film it would have seemed that I, the character who’d found the coat, would be the one for whom it would all go badly. But it did not. I am fine. I am telling you this story.

Alone in the attic with the coat, I did not know what was coming my way; I did not know that the days I had left in that home were numbered, that circumstances were moving toward me that would soon obliterate my quiet life, and in that ignorance I became entirely preoccupied with determining exactly how this coat had entered my home.

And while it is true that a person is always ignorant of the particular future moving toward her person, there will certainly be moments when this truth is truer than others, and such was the case as I spent several days calling all the friends who’d visited my home in the prior weeks and months to discern whether the coat was theirs; the precarity of my present was becoming truer and truer, darker and darker, yet entirely out of view. And though this story ends peacefully, I haven’t degraded that peace by entrapping it here. The moviegoer is best dropped some distance from a story’s true end, and told to walk the last mile alone.

None of my former house guests would claim the coat. No one was missing it; no one wanted it. I found this very difficult to believe. How else could the coat have arrived if it hadn’t been carried in by a living human being, a person who had entered my home through the front door, ascended the stairs, entered the guest room in the attic, and left this coat hanging on a rail in the closet? Unsatisfied, I called all my former guests a second time and still they said, No.

Pascal, my neighbor, most adamantly denied that his mother had been the one to leave the coat. A handsome Frenchwoman, Pascal’s mother had stayed with us while she awaited the birth of her first grandchild. She didn’t speak any English and mostly sat in the backyard, smoking and reading a series of pocket-sized books (or perhaps the same book, repeatedly). I could have sworn I’d seen her wearing the coat, or something like it, but Pascal told me his mother wasn’t missing a coat, and when I called back to check again he assured me that it was absolutely not hers, as she was never so careless with her possessions to leave them in places they did not belong. I had to agree. Of all our house guests, she had left the least behind when she left. She was the one most gone.

I hung the coat on its wooden hanger from a chain in the corner of the kitchen’s ceiling. I assumed the house’s previous owner had hung a potted fern or pothos from that chain, but the man I was living with held a moral objection to keeping plants indoors. I kept cactuses in my office out of his view, but they all kept shriveling away, as if sickened by some unseen smoke coming off that man’s inexplicable convictions. He said nothing about the coat at first, not even when he caught me staring at it, concentrating, trying to come up with a story for how it could have arrived in my life.

One afternoon when I turned away from the coat and back to the man I had been living with for years, I noticed he was sweating and breathing heavily, as he often was when he kneaded all that sourdough. Indeed, he was kneading yet another lump of sourdough. He kneaded and baked loaf after loaf of sourdough, much more than we could ever eat, yet he also complained about how much time and labor all this baking demanded of him and how ungrateful I seemed to be. I did not like sourdough, but he did not like that I did not like it and insisted that I did like it, that I did indeed desire sourdough bread, toasted and sandwiched and dunked in soup, and his insistence succeeded in creating a desire in me for sourdough, which I would eat absently for weeks until I grew tired of it, at which point he would remind me that though I had been taught by modern society to fear bread, bread was in fact the only real fact of life and to deny myself bread would be to embrace death itself. The repeated kneading had created chronic pain in his elbows and shoulders, but knowing how angry it would make him if I suggested he take a break from the baking, I never attempted to make such a suggestion.

The coat’s sudden, cinematic arrival made me feel like someone was filming my life right over my shoulder, a feeling that reminded me of a film director I’d been involved with a long time ago, a man who didn’t read books anymore but still had enough shame to pretend he might soon resume his literacy.

I liked his shame. I liked the way his shame looked in the morning and in the middle of the night. He read the news but was ill-informed. He did not speak the same language as his mother. He couldn’t cook, never made his bed, and was clearly unable to stop spending pointless evenings with women like me, woman after woman, women who differed from one another in only the most superficial ways, though none of us were ever around for long enough to have a chance to seem distinct from one another.

Nights with the director were usually well-written. Dialogue moved at a certain clip. There was enough forward propulsion to keep me there. He had his bits, his little beats, in those date scenes that would have endeared us to an audience if one had been watching. One night he suggested we each guess the other’s single biggest weakness in romantic relationships, write our theories on bar napkins, then exchange the napkins. I wrote of him, ‘Fear of Commitment,’ and he denied it. ‘Restless,’ he wrote of me, which I confirmed.

That winter I sometimes crossed paths with the other women, the women like me, that I knew the director had dated before or after or during my tenure. We beheld each other with grim respect, like actors up for the same role passing each other in the waiting room. Seeing them relieved me of the burden of being singular; I relished the romance of their loathing.

Those years felt entirely unreal, as if every moment was occurring in a film under his direction. Even the mornings I woke up alone at my own place, I could have sworn he was commanding the drift of sunlight across the bed, whispering instructions to the many crew members and assistants who carried out his every whim. He cued everything, it seemed, saturating every hour with his symbolism, transforming my life into an allegory for something more important than my life. What a relief when he stopped calling and I was allowed off set, allowed to return to the meaninglessness of things.

A steady decade passed, frameless, a sheer existence, a privacy that lasted right up to the moment I held that coat, and became burdened with the need to explain it, and with that burden came a frame, but no one can live in a frame. All you can do in a frame is wait for its edges to finally break and release its contents. Then the narrative ends. Then you’re free. In the meantime, you’re not exactly living.

For a week, the coat hung in the kitchen, and hung over me even when I was not in the kitchen. I wondered whether the man I was living with was ever going to say anything about it, or whether he was going to keep on baking loaf after loaf, but he said nothing of the coat and seemed to double his production of sourdough.

I began to ask myself questions such as, Am I living in an independently-financed and over-produced tragicomedy directed by a young and promising visionary who no longer reads books? The answer was always yes, sadly, yes, until the day I impulsively yanked the coat down and put it on. It was much too large for me so I rolled up the sleeves to reveal a dirty lining, silk the color of sweat-stained cotton.

The man I was living with told me he liked my new coat, though he didn’t believe in fashion, so this was just his way of saying he liked the person I appeared to be while wearing the coat. This was unsurprising since I knew he preferred me to look a little ugly, a little more like him. Recently I’d come home with a vintage silk slip that I’d bought for the way it felt in my hands at the thrift store, softened by such frequent use that it must have become meaningless to its last owner. When I put the slip on in front of him and looked briefly beautiful, the man became angry and took it off my body and fucked me.

Where on earth would you go looking like that, he asked, and I didn’t know.

Nowhere, I said.

I had no plans to be seen in that slip by anyone but myself, but the coat suggested I might have places to go, business to attend to.

Then came the day that he yelled my name from his den, yelling that he needed to tell me something. I yelled back that I was coming, and he said, quickly, come quickly, so I ran.

He informed me he had just taken a large dose of poison. This upset me.

He said the poison would take effect within the next five minutes, after which he would be gone forever so if there was anything I wanted to say to him I should say it immediately. This upset me further, upset me so much I smiled.

Had he been so miserable as this? Had he always been so miserable?

I can see you are upset, he said. You see, he knew me quite well.

My first thought was that he might have taken the poison because of the cacti I’d been keeping in my office. He was so sensitive, much more so than other people, and so very in touch with so very many important sensations. He could see things that were not there, or rather he could see things that absolutely were there though the rest of us were simply too blunt and blind to notice. He could know things about people he’d never met, people I’d only mentioned in passing, people he told me to avoid. He could see my thoughts, he said, and over time I began to think so too. Still, as he sat there dying I did not confess to keeping the cacti in my office, as I assumed he had already intuited that I’d brought plant life into our home in order to test his convictions and perceptions. Or, if he hadn’t known of the cacti, but would have preferred for me to think that he had known about the cacti all along, I knew I could have easily been convinced of that, too. And so, there was simply no point in confessing.

The poison was busily shutting down shop in his body. He sat there on his favorite chair-like object, something low to the ground he’d brought back from travels to a distant country, and he looked up at me with the profound relaxation of someone who had arrived in the place he’d long longed for. He lit a cigar, one he’d been saving for a special occasion. I watched him expire. I can’t remember what I said, or if I said anything at all, as I am so comically forgetful.

Just before he died, however, he told me one last thing about myself. He said it was a shame that I had not yet learned to be a precise person, that I should work hard to try to learn to be more precise, that I should be more patient and more precise, more precise (he was repeating himself) that I should try to find a way to say what I really meant without wasting so much time and energy. I shouldn’t waste other people’s time. I shouldn’t waste their time with my imprecision.

I watched the cigar fall from his hand. His eyes were still open. The curtains caught fire and he sat there staring at me as the flames grew overhead, staring at me like a perfect picture of apathy, motionless as the flames ascended his pant leg. This was not how I thought that Tuesday was going to turn out.

The house was growing smoky so the only reasonable thing to do was to take a walk, to commit to a direction without hesitation or regret. I wasn’t entirely sure where to go, but now I also lacked a place to return to, and in that homelessness I felt most at home in the coat. When I stood still with my arms hanging, my hands fit perfectly into its big pockets.

The coat was technically too big for me, but what did that mean, really? I knew I was larger than I appeared to be, like an object in a rear-view mirror.

Weeks passed, and I acquired, through no easy means, living situations. One of my best qualities at this time was how transportable I was, how I could fold up into the scantest little places, subsisting on hardly anything. Guest rooms, guest rooms, I cruised from guest room to guest room, making apple tarts in thanks, sleeping beside older brothers if that’s what it took, stripping the bed, dusting the coffee tables, rinsing my toothpaste out of the sink.

Without that man around to object, I began to wear the silk slip beneath that hideous coat, and I found that the suggestive beauty of the slip was canceled out by the mealy dilapidation of the Ghost Coat, the proper name I gave it that fall.

I was living in one of those guest rooms when the phone call came from the coroner. The autopsy revealed that he had been asleep when he died, that he had not suffered, that he never even knew he was inside a house on fire. The autopsy revealed he had a genetic predisposition to heroism, to omniscience, to clairvoyance. It was not his negligence that had burned down the house, the autopsy revealed, but rather it was a deliberate choice he’d subliminally made for my sake, a selfless choice of freeing me from his sway. The autopsy revealed that he did not love me upon his death, but extracts from his charcoaled marrow demonstrated that he had once loved me and, above all, he had for years enjoyed how I had allowed him the endless lease of my body. He had been thankful for that, thankful that I made absolutely no noise when he fucked me, thankful that I did as he said, lived as he said, ate what he gave me. There is so much joy in pet ownership. There is so much joy in the supplication of an animal.

No. What’s come over me? The autopsy said none of this. I should remember the vow I took, the vow the film director had taught me a decade earlier. Know that there are Great Men in this world whose thoughts you simply cannot understand. Great Men who rightly know the precise contours of the interiority possessed by any woman within his spitting distance.

Our house had been so cozy before it burned down, and his mouth muscles were so powerful that he could spit at me from almost any distance, a kind of certainty I may never live with again.

On Thanksgiving Day that fall, I wore the slip and the Ghost Coat to the lavish brownstone of a friend of a friend where a mother, a father and three daughters were hosting a holiday dinner for people without families, or people who’d been banished by their families, or people who’d banished themselves from their families. Seated among a group of strange men, I summoned a little sanity and asked each of them polite questions about their origins and occupations.

The men were all from France and they were all film directors, and some of them were wearing coats quite like mine, and some of them leaned toward me to study my freckled collarbone visible between the wool lapels as I sat there holding a naked secret at the center of me – how unwell I was.

Do you know Pascal? I asked, inferring from the sound of my voice that I was already a bit drunk. His mother is from – Something, France. I forget where –

They looked at me like it was a game, and maybe it was, my little game, yet I had no next step for it, no rules, no plot twist, so I changed the subject quickly to the only other French thing I could recall. Had any of them seen that recent film about the professional motor show dancer with a metal plate in her head who kills a man who is bothering her, has sex with a car, becomes pregnant, fails to self-administer an abortion, kills some additional people, burns down her family’s house with her parents locked inside, then goes into hiding by disguising herself as a missing boy, then climbs atop a fire engine in order to seduce an audience of homoerotically-charged firefighters?

The French directors looked at me as if I were truly stupid, as if I were a child sitting on the shoulders of another child, wearing their father’s oldest and shittiest blazer, which was, in a way, exactly what I could not help but be – a pile of small children, a pile of something within the body of a woman who had grown so tired. Tired of all the men who would only believe me if I believed what they believed, and of the haunted feeling all this disbelief left me with. I had tried over and over to understand their ways of seeing things, though it kept escaping me, a mere woman.

But I have always wanted to get along with everyone, to be a nice guest, so I smiled the smile of a cooperative woman, a woman just trying to make conversation since it was Thanksgiving. I, too, wanted to be thankful for something or barring that I wanted someone to be thankful for me.

The French directors began to sigh and complain in French to each other and as I listened to them I found myself faintly hoping that one of the directors might speak forcefully enough that I would be splattered with the tiniest fleck of his saliva. The director to my left translated the complaints of the other French directors: Yes, indeed, they all knew this film and they all felt they had been personally injured by its existence and further hurt by its success.

That woman, one of them said, what is wrong with that woman? For a moment I thought they meant me, what was wrong with me, and for a moment I thought they might actually tell me, once and for all, what was wrong with me. But it was the female French director of that film who stirred their complaint.

The French directors explained that the film had been grotesque and filled with gratuitous violence, that its tone had changed too often, its genre had changed too quickly, and the heroine had looked so unhappy the whole way through. They never understood what the metaphors were metamorphing, and though it was obviously an allegory, its allegorical objects were all garbled, and above all the film simply wanted too much, wanted to be much more than a single film should be, that it never asked for permission, that it kept breaking down locked doors, breaking promises, stabbing out eyes.

The French directors reminded each other of how they had all taken vows of purity and obedience in their calling as auteurs, but the woman who had made this film clearly had taken none of them, and this simply would not do. Being French, the French directors did not believe in God, but being a certain kind of man they couldn’t help but be God-fearing, prone to simply insert whatever was most convenient into the crucible of the idea of God.

As if by magic, or as in a poorly-conceived film, Pascal showed up right then and caught everyone’s attention by shouting my name and asking: What happened to you?

I wondered if he could see it now, how the Ghost Coat must have been his mother’s coat, even if it wasn’t his mother’s coat. It was simply the only logical option. But I couldn’t manage to tell him this, to tell him the truth about his own mother.

But I didn’t or couldn’t say anything to Pascal, busy as I was with managing this wild, new sensation, this raw and righteous anger provoked by an aesthetic disagreement with a large group of men. It had never occurred to me that anyone could have seen this film as anything other than a work of True and Troubling Art and the more they disparaged it, the more violent I felt.

It must make you all feel quite inadequate, I told the directors, to see a Cadillac doing what that Cadillac did to her. The sound of forks dropping on plates. You don’t know anything, none of you know anything about being the object beneath the subject, about being the container, about being a soft thing impaled by metal. Pascal looked confused. And you won’t, I continued, you won’t know anything about it, ever, because you’re so certain you already do! You’re everything that is wrong with the world! You are the enemy of progress and nuance and pleasure!

All at once I felt truly empty. The happy family that was hosting this lovely Thanksgiving dinner stared at me from their end of the dining table and their daughters smiled in conspiracy as I raised a fork and lowered it quickly into the shoulder of the French director to my left, which helped me regain my strength. He hardly said a word, just whimpered as he bled pints and pints of his mother’s blood, but I’d had quite enough of everything. I vowed to no longer mistake obedience for love.

I crossed my silverware on my dirty plate, the universal signal of being done, then I saw myself out of that lovely home. I closed the door gently behind me and I walked a long mile alone in the dark, growing sober as I thought through every extant variable of this one soft life I carry. I was no longer trying to make sense of the past. I began to consider the direction in which my human term would now move, and once I had walked that one full mile I shed the coat directly onto the pavement and kept walking.

    "text": "The founders of the Institute were not exactly sure what they were looking for. They were looking for a ‘live player’, someone who might stretch their legs or stab you, and you wouldn’t be sure of which until it happened. They wanted Barron Trump to be the new Caesar. They wanted Klaus Kinski to shill Bitcoin. They wanted eyes like his, boiling in their shells. Pressure would hiss from behind their leaching plastic contact lenses. And then: they’d open, plastic slick to the skull. A live player saw the rules of the game for what they were. The founders would not spell out these rules because they were impossible to sum up. Ancient Chinese philosophers had tried. Robert Greene had tried, with his forty-eight laws of power. But the live players had this knowledge almost primordially, the way a lizard understands how to move through grass.

The signs of a live player could be simple: majoring in political science was a negative sign, while pure math was positive. Being from a wealthy family was positive, especially if the wealth was stored or made overseas in a country other than Switzerland, which was a boring and obvious choice. Liking certain authors was positive: Habermas, Spengler, Borges, Goethe.

Knowing each country’s major imports and exports was essential, mostly so you could have an opinion on Vanuatu. Indonesian was, this year, a very good sign. German had been better last year, but was still superior to French. Chinese was practically a requirement. Certain colleges were known to produce certain types: Harvard had no one of value, except for a Belgian tap dancer who had once pledged to them that ‘many must perish so few may rise’. She assumed she would be one of the few. Princeton had a few contestants, disproportionately Comparative Literature students who ranted about Turgenev at Malibu pool parties. Oxford had some promising Turkish intelligence officers. Cornell was not reached out to.

The Institute was meeting at Yale, at a corner bar with a pool table and subpar beer. It was only a society at this point, attempting to build itself out. Many projects had been proposed: the largest organic beef farm in America funded by Chinese investors, nuclear fission in Canada, graphite mines in the Philippines, joining the international Ambergris trade, using LIDAR to dig in Afghanistan for wares to sell at indecent auction houses. Some of the founders were secretly considering grad school, but they would not tell anyone that. Most were currently assistants at think tanks, but they’d call their roles ‘chief of staff’ when asked, as if a think tank was a small country. Each of the founders secretly believed that, if dropped in a small country, they could quickly start running it.

The first candidate of the night would be arriving soon. The three founders sat in a booth in the bar, against a window. One was tall and skinny and oscillated between handsome and gaunt, depending on how much beef fat he cooked his morning eggs in. One was small and wiry, with pimples balletically arching over his brow. The last one was fat in the way comic book characters were, but he leaned into it, sometimes even wearing a porkpie hat. The tall one was quieter than the other two, who would drill facts out of their skulls as if excavation of their objects was necessary for the survival of the containers. They talked about synthetic palm oil, the upcoming Ecuadorian elections, South Korean ping pong champions. Two were wearing penny loafers, their sweating pinky toes rubbing against the leather. One was wearing a suit jacket found in his stepfather’s closet, custom-made on a trip to Vietnam. It was too small – his stepfather did CrossFit. They ordered beers for the table and let them sit, the glasses sweating.

A pale boy entered the bar, his eyes round and dark. He stalked over to the founders’ booth.

‘Are you the Institute? I’m Peter.’

‘You’ve got us,’ the fat one said, shrugging off the suit jacket.

‘I saw the posters about a reading group around campus, and I had to come. I love Spengler.’

‘Oh, really? Where are you from?’

‘Upper West Side. I study political science.’ These two facts canceled each other out.

‘Which high school?’ the gaunt one asked, stirring his beer foam.

‘Horace Mann, do you know anyone there?’

‘We have our guys,’ the small one assured him. They did not have anyone from Horace Mann. Peter would be the first.

It was clear that Peter was the son of a billionaire from the way he kept mentioning his ‘family friends’, of whom there seemed to be a rotating cast. He was vaguely rat-like and kind; the gaunt one liked him in the pitying way the children of professors admire the rich. His favorite poet was Percy Shelley. He said ‘wow’ a lot. He had made some short films in high school but put the camera down as soon as he started college. He had gone to Kyrgyzstan for a month, mostly to kill time. Going somewhere remote for a month just to look around was considered a sign of a live player, and Kyrgyzstan was a place on the rise, whether or not Peter knew it: he had struck gold.

‘We will be in contact,’ the small one said, going to shake hands with Peter, who was already skulking out the door.

‘He seems to be in a permanent state of defeat,’ the fat one said. ‘Bad sign.’

‘Lack of confidence can be a sign of low Magnesium,’ nodded the gaunt one. ‘We don’t want Deficients.’

‘Then that’s eighty percent of the American population out of the running,’ said the small one. They nodded gravely and awaited the next candidate. They picked up their beers and sat them back down. The fat one asked the gaunt one about his thoughts on the recent Danish election and whether it proved any of Bruno Latour’s theories. The gaunt one shrugged. The fat one guessed he had never read Latour. Realizing this, he felt a little triumphant.

A lanky figure opened the bar door and stared at them.

‘Do you three make up the Institute?’ he asked. They asked him to sit down.

The pale figure’s name was Mikael. He looked cancerous: his hair was patching off, he was junkie thin, his skin had the glassy look of a Christmas ornament. His eyes shook in their sockets, as if experiencing turbulence. Mikael explained, since his appearance needed an explanation, that he had been bedridden since he was fifteen. His disease, he said, was mysterious. It had allowed him to read almost everything worth reading – there had been nothing else to do. The founders tried to quiz him on Portuguese authors, the new Chinese century, Bougainville’s independence. He would interrupt them before they finished speaking.

He said he had ideas for the Institute, big ones. They would start by unfurling a large banner from a very high place. There would be someone on a horse, or in a helicopter. Something would be dropped from a great height onto an empty field. People would learn the Institute’s name. Mikael said he was willing to play any part, major or minor. There was something about him that was a little unreal, as if he didn’t yet know that taxes existed, or laws. Mikael said he knew some people high up in the Chinese government who ran a diamond mine in Tanzania on the side. He could introduce them. He said he knew TCB-2 suppliers in the Netherlands and that they could make the drug big in the States. He said he knew the Vyvanse-addicted daughter of an oil magnate and she would buy them a brownstone on the Upper East Side if they just agreed to be her friends. He said he knew some of the rationalist philanthropists in San Francisco who were throwing money around before their AI killed everyone on Earth. He said the philanthropists all had bunkers in New Zealand and he could get them into a bunker too when the time came. He said that time would come, they had to trust him on that one.

Mikael looked the founders square on when he said this. They shifted a bit in their seats – there was something about him that shamed them. He seemed to have been stewing in place, hardening for years. They didn’t have anyone with a waxy exterior like that, someone who could get burnt and keep walking. He seemed like he could regenerate, like he had regenerated several times already. He had a strange, stilted accent, like someone who had learned how to sound British from watching recordings of Shakespeare performances on the BBC. He claimed to be from a royal family, a branch that had been cut off and displaced to Reno, Nevada. He showed them a ring engraved with his family crest. There was a pot-bellied pig in the middle of it.

‘That’s Swedish,’ he said. ‘Traditional.’

Most of the guys in the Institute had vague dreams of being a Rockefeller: one had gone around touring plastics factories until he reported back that starting a factory was shockingly hard, even in the Philippines. There was a reason everyone just did consulting now. There was a reason everyone sold online financial planning courses or edited the college essays of high school students in Westchester. The founders couldn’t even imagine finding a banner large enough to unfurl off a building. They were waiting for the right donor to charm, someone who could throw money at them if they danced the right two-step, bowed deep enough, repeated the correct facts in the proper order. Mikael’s hair seemed to be falling away from him as he talked – he didn’t have time to wait.

Mikael’s sickness was infecting the bar; it was empty now, and the table felt sticky. There was a draft that penetrated even the custom Vietnamese suit jacket. The founders hoped Mikael was a pathological liar with a psychosomatic disease, one that would magically disappear when he got a girlfriend. They hoped he wouldn’t start a lucrative industrial shrimp farming company, or make it big in horse betting. He couldn’t become a lizard in the grass, not like this, dying. They wanted to get rid of him. No one would miss him, except maybe a bio-hacking group chat. Even then, they doubted he ever posted physique updates; they were sure he just lurked.

The founders looked straight at him, his curling, hard eyes volleying back. His skin seemed to turn more translucent as they watched, like an amphibian reacting to a change in water temperature – his veins and blood pulsing with expectation, his molars expanding in his mouth, his lymph nodes swelling up through his jaw. His ear twitched.

One of the founders held out a hand to shake."

Every summer, when the scholar trees were in bloom, Old Han the blacksmith from Zhangqiu County would put in an appearance with his two apprentices. They unloaded their cart under the big scholar tree at the entrance of the village, set up their stall and built the forge. Then the clanging would start up. The first thing they worked on was not an implement, but a piece of pig iron. They heated the metal till it was red-hot, beat it out, reheated it, beat it again, folded it, beat it into a long, flat strip, then repeated the process of folding it and beating it long and flat. Under their hammers, the red-hot iron was like dough in a woman’s hand, they could knead it into any shape they wanted. They beat that piece of pig iron until it became steel. When I was a kid, I saw a sentence that read ‘Well-tempered steel is flexible’ in my brother’s middle-school textbook. I immediately saw the blacksmiths in my mind’s eye, and their clanging echoed in my ears. This strip of steel would be filed into strips by the blacksmith and clamped to the blades of the villagers’ kitchen knives, sickles and other farm tools, to repair them. As long as the tempering was done properly, these steel-reinforced implements sat nicely in the hand and stayed sharp, which meant that the job could be done better and faster. That was why people in our village never went to the marketing cooperative to buy the shoddy tools produced by the farm-tools factory. And that was why Old Han had to come to our village every year. There must be children like me in the many villages to the north-east of Gaomi City, who think back nostalgically to the blacksmiths’ visits every year at scholar-tree blossom time, and remember how we were their faithful audience.

Old Han had two apprentices. One was his nephew, known by everyone as Young Han. The other was called Old Third. Old Han was tall and thin, bald, with a long neck and weepy eyes. Young Han was big and burly. Old Third was dwarfish and squat, with short legs and long arms, built like an orangutan. He was cheerful and talkative, in sharp contrast to the more taciturn Young Han. When they were working, Old Han held the tongs, Young Han swung the sledgehammer, and Old Third worked the bellows to raise the heat. When it was a big job, he also weighed in with a twelve-pound hammer. The three of them made an impressive tableau as they rained down the blows in quick succession. Young Han’s hammer weighed eighteen pounds.

My grandad was a skilled carpenter and craftsman, and he was a demanding customer. It was obvious to me that the blacksmiths didn’t like him, and that upset me. Once, Grandad went to them with an axe and asked them to reinforce the blade with a steel strip. He’d had the axe for many years, and the metal had largely rusted away and been absorbed into the wooden handle. Old Han took the axe and looked at it.

‘You call this an axe?’ he said.

‘What else is it?’ Grandad riposted.

‘I’ll make you another one.’

‘I don’t want another one. If you can’t do the job, I’ll find someone else to do it.’

‘Relax, old man,’ Old Third spoke up. ‘There’s nothing we can’t fix, fodder choppers, scissors, you name it.’

‘Can you do embroidery needles?’ Grandad asked.

‘Nope,’ said Old Third. Then he said with a smile: ‘Listen, old man, we’re in the same industry, right? I mean, you’re a carpenter.’

‘It’s one yuan for a new axe, and it’ll cost you one and a half to fix this old thing,’ Old Han said.

‘That’s barefaced robbery!’ said Grandad.

‘Take it or leave it,’ said Old Han firmly.

‘Okay,’ Grandad said. ‘But you better make a decent job of it, this isn’t any old axe.’

‘It’s Lu Ban’s axe, is it?’ Old Third joked.

‘Lu Ban is a folk legend, Guan Er is a real person,’ Grandad said.

Guan Er was my grandad’s name.

Old Third went to the rusty iron plate leaning against the tree trunk, cocked his head on one side, and chalked: guan er, one axe head, add steel, 1.5 yuan.

I piped up: ‘It’s written wrong! The “guan” should be 管 not 官, and the axe should be 斧 not 福!’

No one paid any attention to me.

Uncle Zhao the cowman dropped an old chopper on the ground and said, ‘Old Han, you’re late this year, aren’t you?’

‘No, we’re not, it’s the same day as last year,’ Old Han muttered.

‘I need this fixed, put a steel strip on it. How soon can you do it? I’m in a hurry,’ Uncle Zhao said.

‘Ten yuan!’

‘Are you off your head?!’

‘Ten yuan!’

‘I can’t pay that,’ Uncle Zhao said. ‘I’ll get the team head to come and see you in a bit.’

‘It’ll still be ten yuan,’ said Old Third.

‘Let me find you a wife, Old Third,’ Uncle Zhao said.

‘Pull the other one, Old Zhao! You said the same thing last year.’

‘Did I say that last year?’ said Uncle Zhao. ‘Well, this year I mean it. There’s a young woman from my wife’s family who’s fair-skinned and tall and has a nice figure. She just has a few eye problems.’

‘That doesn’t matter as long as she can see enough to cook a meal.’

‘She has no problem cooking a meal,’ said Uncle Zhao. ‘She can even see well enough to sew shoes.’

‘Then go and talk to them,’ said Old Third. ‘All I want is a wife.’

Old Han glanced at Old Third and heaved a sigh.

Hundred-Acres Tian turned up next, looking gloomy. ‘I need a sickle,’ he said.

‘And the old one?’ asked Old Third.

‘Don’t have one.’

‘You want a Jiaoxian sickle or a Yexian sickle?’ asked Old Han.

Jiaoxian sickles are narrow, Yexian sickles are wide. Jiaoxian sickles are light, Yexian sickles are heavy. People have their preferences.

‘I want a leftie sickle.’

‘A leftie sickle?’ asked Old Third. ‘What’s that?’

‘A sickle for someone who’s left-handed.’

‘But left-handed people use a sickle with their right hand!’ Old Third objected.

‘Gotcha,’ said Old Han. ‘We’ll make you a leftie sickle.’

Just then, Happy, the village idiot and Liu Laosan’s son, ran along the road stark naked, with his younger sister following behind holding his clothes.

‘Didn’t they get a cure-all woman in to see him last year?’ said Old Third.

‘Cure-all, my foot!’ scoffed Uncle Zhao. ‘She was nothing but a quack!’

Hundred-Acres Tian looked down and said nothing.

‘I told you all last year that real cure-all docs don’t walk around the streets ringing a bell. The family got screwed over, didn’t they?!’ said Old Third.

‘Get to work!’ Old Han said angrily, pulling a piece of red-hot iron out of the forge.

The boy squatting under the trees cutting grass left-handed was called Tian Kui. Five years older than me, he was the only son of Hundred-Acres Tian, and had been a classmate of my second older brother. My brother passed the exams and got a place in Madian Middle School, eighteen li away from where we lived. Tian Kui’s marks were better than my brother’s, but he had dropped out of school and spent his time cutting grass.

That was a job that a lot of kids in the village did. I used to do it when classes were over too. We took the grass to be weighed at the production team livestock sheds and earned one work point for every ten pounds. In those days, in the people’s communes, you earned work points not cash, and they were the main way that the year-end distribution to households was calculated too. We used to joke that work points were the ‘family jewels’.

I was not a born grass-cutter. My big sister could cut more than a hundred pounds a day and regularly earned a dozen work points, which was even more than the men. There was one day when I only cut a pound of grass. When I took it to be weighed, I was greeted with shouts of laughter. The cowman, Uncle Zhao, poked the grass with his finger and said, ‘You’re a real model worker!’ From then on, Model Worker was my nickname.

Over dinner that evening, the whole family weighed in with criticisms of their Model Worker.

‘Imagine us having a Model Worker in the family!’ said my grandad. ‘Were you harvesting lingzhi mushrooms or something?’

My father said: ‘You must have been sitting on the ground and picking the grass with your toes. No wonder it took you all afternoon to get a pound of grass!’

My mother said: ‘What were you actually doing all that time?’

‘Stealing melons and jujubes, for sure,’ said my big sister.

I burst into tears. ‘I spent all afternoon looking for grass, but I couldn’t find any!’

‘Tomorrow you’re coming with me,’ said Sis. ‘No running off.’

But I didn’t want to go with Sis, I wanted to find Tian Kui.

Tian Kui spent all his time working in the woods. It was full of graves and he used to go from one grave to another, cutting the wispy tussocks of cogon and themeda grass that grew on them, to sell for forage. I didn’t think these bits were worth bothering with but Tian Kui used to crouch down, or bend low, and patiently shave the grass from the graves with his leftie sickle. Normally, we used our right hand to swing the sickle and gathered the cut grass in our left hand. He cut with his left hand because he had no right hand. He had an iron hook tied to his right arm and he used the iron hook to pull the cut grass together. His hook seemed much more effective than my hand so I gave his leftie sickle a go, but it felt very awkward.

‘Have you always used your left hand?’ I asked him.

‘When I started in school, I held the pen in my left hand,’ he said. ‘But the teacher made me change to my right. I still used my left hand when the teacher wasn’t looking. I wrote faster with my left, slower with my right. Nice with my left, ugly with my right.’

‘My brother said that you were a good student.’

‘Not that good.’

‘Why don’t you take the middle-school exams?’

He pointed with his right hook at a grave in front of him and whispered: ‘There’s a big snake in that grave.’

‘How big?’ I asked fearfully, mussing up my hair. We believed that when a snake met a child, it counted the hairs on the child’s head. You had until it finished counting before it stole your soul away. So if you met a snake, you had to muss up your hair straight away.

‘Wanna see it?’

I followed him hesitantly to the grave.

There were several fist-sized holes in the gravestone, and he pointed to one of them.

I held my breath, ruffled my hair, and moved closer. At first it was too dark to see anything, but gradually I made out a huge, fat snake, dark-coloured with white stripes. I couldn’t see its whole length, only a part of it. I felt a chill of fear and crept backwards. I got as far away as I could before I dared to speak.

‘Have you ever seen it come out?’ I asked.

‘Twice.’

‘How long is it?’

‘As long as a shoulder pole.’

‘What . . . what does it look like?’ I asked. ‘Does it have a crest on its head?’

‘Yup.’

‘What colour is it?’

‘Sort of purple-red.’

‘Like a ripe mulberry?’

‘Yup.’

‘Have you ever heard it make a noise?’

‘Yup.’

‘What kind of noise?’

‘It croaked. A bit like a frog.’

‘Aren’t you scared of being here alone every day?’

‘I’ve never been scared of anything, not since my dad chopped off my hand.’

Ioften think back to that hot afternoon when Tian Kui was still a kid with two hands.

We were all at the village pond, on the south side of the village. We’d hung our clothes from the tree branches and were messing around in the water, trying to catch fish.

There were bulrushes and reeds growing in the pond, and we were crawling in and out of them. Suddenly someone shouted:

‘Here’s Happy!’

Happy, the village idiot, only son of Liu Laosan.

He was running naked along the path towards the pond. His younger sister was chasing after him, carrying his clothes.

Happy was seventeen or eighteen years old, with a well-developed body, a dark bush of pubic hair and big genitals. He got to the edge of the pond, stopped, and laughed foolishly.

I honestly can’t remember who it was, but someone shouted: ‘Let’s throw mud at the idiot!’

We scooped up black sludge and threw it at Happy.

A lump of it hit him in the chest. He just stood there, still laughing.

A lump of it hit his genitals. He covered his crotch with both hands.

We howled with laughter. We were having fun.

‘Beat up the idiot! Beat him up!’

A lump landed in his face. Happy covered his face with both hands.

Happy’s sister finally caught up with him, still clutching his clothes. She stood in front of him and a lump of mud hit her on the chest. She burst into tears and shouted at us: ‘Don’t hit him, he’s only an idiot!’

Another lump landed on her head, and she cried: ‘Don’t hit him! He’s just an idiot, he doesn’t understand anything!’

Happy’s sister was called Joy. She was about the same age as my second elder brother, and a very good-looking girl. Happy was a fine-looking young man too. The villagers used to say what a pity it was that he was an idiot.

Joy did her best to shield her brother and got covered in mud herself. She wept and raged at us: ‘You bastards, bullying an idiot! God’ll punish you, you’ll be struck by thunder! You bastards!’

Maybe it was the threat of divine punishment, or because we felt guilty, or were just tired of the game, but we suddenly stopped and scrambled in among the bulrushes and the reeds, some still yelling, others silent.

That evening, we were eating dinner in our yard when Liu Laosan stormed in. He was furious.

‘Good evening, Third Brother, you’re just in time for dinner,’ my father greeted him, then said to my sister: ‘Get a stool for your uncle.’

But Liu Laosan spoke to my grandad: ‘Second Uncle, there’s never been bad feeling between our two families, has there?’

My grandad was taken aback. ‘Laosan, what are you talking about? Your father and I are old comrades, we go back years. We were labourers together in the Eighth Route Army, in the Yimeng Mountains. I got dysentery and if your dad hadn’t looked after me, my bones would have ended up in a mountain gully.’

‘Right then,’ said Liu Laosan, and turned to my father. ‘So I want to ask these two boys why they were so mean to Happy and Joy this afternoon.’

‘What?’ My dad leapt to his feet and pointed his finger at my brother and me. ‘What were you two doing?’ he demanded angrily.

We got up and stood in a huddle. ‘We . . . we didn’t do anything . . .’ we stammered.

Liu Laosan began to wail: ‘I must have done wicked things in an earlier life to have a son like him, coming up to twenty years old and running around the village stark naked. He’s a disgrace! I’ve tried tethering him but he escapes. It must be God’s punishment on me. But all the same, he’s just an idiot! If he wasn’t, would he be running around naked? What were you thinking of, beating up an idiot? Joy begged you to stop, on her knees, and you still wouldn’t stop!’

Liu Laosan squatted down, clasping his head between his hands.

My father picked up a stool and hurled it at the two of us.

‘Come here, kneel down to your third uncle!’ Grandad commanded.

We fell to our knees. ‘Third Uncle, please forgive us!’ my brother begged. ‘We were in the wrong. But we didn’t start it . . .’

‘Then who did?’ our dad demanded, about to throw the stool again. ‘Who was the ringleader?’

‘It was, um . . .’ my brother hesitated.

‘Go on!’ Dad lifted the stool above his head.

‘It was Tian Kui,’ my brother said. ‘Tian Kui was the ringleader . . .’

Dad turned to me and whacked me hard with the stool. ‘You tell me, who was it?’

‘Tian Kui,’ I said. ‘He started it. If we hadn’t gone along with him, he would have beaten us up. He made us do it. He’s stronger than us.’

‘If either of you are lying, I’ll cut your tongues out,’ my father said.

‘We’re not lying,’ my brother said. ‘I broke Tian Kui’s torch. If I hadn’t joined in and beaten up Happy, he’d have asked me to buy him a new one.’

‘Did you hear Tian Kui say that?’ Dad asked me, his tone gentler now.

‘Yes I did,’ I said. ‘He said, “If you don’t join in, I’ll get back at you for that and the torch!”’

‘Brother Laosan,’ said my father, still holding the stool. ‘I haven’t brought my sons up right. I apologise to you. About what happened . . .’

But Liu Laosan said: ‘Brother, forget it, it’s nothing. Nothing will come between our two families, ever. What I don’t understand is why Tian Kui wanted to beat up my son. He’s from a landlord family and we’re poor peasants, but when his grandad Tian Yuan was being struggled against and had his land taken off him, my dad vouched for him. If he hadn’t, the old man would have been dragged out and executed on the spot. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you! It’s not right! I need to get a few things straight with the Tians!’

And Liu Laosan stormed out angrily.

I felt something warm on my neck. When I touched it, I saw blood on my fingers.

My father spoke to both of us very seriously: ‘I’m asking you again, was Tian Kui really the ringleader?’

His face in the moonlight had gone as dark red as the iron in the forge.

‘Aren’t you done yet?’ my mother said to him, sprinkling some lime powder on my brother’s head wound. ‘You almost killed him!’

‘Mum, I’m bleeding too!’ I wailed.

‘That Liu Laosan!’ my elder sister burst out. ‘Why’s he using his idiot son to make trouble for other people?’

My father threw the stool to the ground. ‘Shut up!’ he roared.

After all these years, I still dream about watching the leftie sickle being made under the big scholar tree at the entrance to the village. It already had its rough shape and was in the forge heating up. No, it was already white-hot and the strip of steel they were going to add to the blade was white-hot too. Old Third worked the box bellows with all his might, his body swaying forwards and backwards as he pushed and pulled on the handle attached to the pull rods. Old Han clamped the leftie sickle with the tongs, gripping them with both hands as he pulled it out of the fire. Then he laid it on the anvil and added the strip of steel to the sickle blade. He picked up a small hammer with a head as slender as a conductor’s baton and dealt the first blow to this brilliantly shining piece of work. Young Han swung the eighteen-pound hammer up, then brought it down and hit the blade in the exact same spot, with a dull, muffled clang, sealing the steel strip and the sickle blade together. Old Third let go of the bellows handle and wielded the second hammer, which whistled through the air as he hit the still-soft metal. The golden flames in the forge and the dazzling white sparks from the anvil lit up their faces, turning them the same ruddy colour as the iron. The three men formed a triangle, and the three hammers fell one after the other, seemingly without pause. There was something irresistibly powerful, even apocalyptic, about the scene. Here was softness and hardness, cold and heat, cruelty and gentleness, all combined. It was like a piece of music simultaneously resounding and impassioned, and lingeringly sweet. This was what labour, creation, life itself, was all about. This was like growing to adulthood, when a young person’s dreams are forged into reality, their conflicting emotions resolved in the heat of life’s challenges.

And so the leftie sickle was done. It was a carefully crafted implement, a truly custom-made piece of work, which displayed the blacksmiths’ skills at their finest.

Many years later, the village matchmaker Yuan Chunhua was thinking of introducing Joy to Tian Kui. By now, her father, Liu Laosan, and her brother, Happy, were both dead and she was twice-widowed. She had been married to the blacksmith Young Han, and after he died, she married Old Third. Then Old Third died and she moved back to the village with her kid.

‘People say Joy is jinxed,’ Yuan Chunhua warned Tian Kui. ‘Men are scared to marry her. Are you up for it?’

‘Yup!’ said Tian Kui."

The boy walked back to the alcove but Tommy had gone and Carla was sitting on her own. She looked at him. He didn’t know how to read her face. He went into the toilet and Tommy was coming out and the boy threw a punch and missed. Carla grabbed his long hair with both hands and pulled him back by it and said, Gerroff him, ye fucken arsehole. His hair was coming out in clumps and she kept pulling it and he grabbed her by the throat and squeezed it until she let go. She held her neck and sunk down against the wall. The boy went back for Tommy but there was a man stood between them, saying, Just leave it, Shaun. He doesn’t wanna fight.

A don’t wanna fight ye, Tommy said.

What’s she sitten on yer knee for? the boy said.

Just haven a laugh. We weren’t doin owt.

A crowd had gathered outside the toilets. Let them fight, Malc said. Git them ootside.

Leave it, Malc, Tommy’s uncle said, stepping forward. He hasn’t done owt wrong.

Does thou wanna gar an aw? Malc said. A’ll send ye inte fucken space, lad.

Just leave it, Malc. What’s wrong wid ye?

Gar on, Malc said, fuck off out uh my pub. The lot uh yers. Gar on, fuck off afoor a flip me fucken lid. The boy came to his father’s side and he looked upset. Tommy and his uncle and his friend filed out of the back door with Carla after them and Malc and his boy watched them leave. The crowd filtered away. Malc shook his head at his boy and said, What ye playen at?

The boy was speaking to a blonde girl outside of Malc’s club, and he made her laugh, and her eyes appeared to sparkle. It was a cold night and the smokers were out in the corrugated shelter Malc had installed on the veranda. Nana Marie was working the door. She used to be married to Crazy, who during his prime was the hardest man in Wigton. Nana Marie was a big solid woman and her hair was grey and cut into a pixie style. She fought like a man and sometimes fought with them and the boy liked her very much. The blonde girl was telling something to the boy when Nana Marie caught his eye and made her hand into a fist and raised it like a phallus. The boy smiled and the blonde girl looked back over her shoulder. Come wid us, the girl said, we’re off te the Hare an Hounds.

A have te gan in here, the boy said, but a’ll mebe see ye later on. Nana Marie was laughing when he went over to her shaking his head. They hugged one another and she felt good and warm and he rubbed her back. Aw, she said. He’s my lad. The boy kissed her cheek and told her he’d see her in a bit and he went through the inner doors and into the club. It was busy and the dance music was loud and the bass was deep and throbbing and most of the people were standing as if drawn to the brightness of the bar, each in a different situation in the changing colours of light. The man who had stolen Malc’s money was there. He was talking and laughing with someone smaller than him. He’s nicked the money off me fatha, the boy thought, an he’s laughen. He’s here an he’s laughen. The boy looked over at his father, serving behind the bar, leaning forward to hear a customer over the music. He felt nervous about what he had to do. He knew most of the faces he passed on his way to the bar and someone asked about Newcastle and about his band and he kept it brief and made his way through the crowd. He hadn’t wanted to drink because he was in training and looking after himself in terms of his diet and as a result had grown unaccustomed to alcohol. But he felt that the mission required a drink. It’s not cause a’m a shithouse, he thought. A know a can hit someone in a boxen scenario an a know a can fight when it’s self-defence, but a’ve had fuck all experience wid an unsuspecten target. An that’s what a need te prepare for. Yer not interested in fairness or sportsmanship in war. It’s all about how effectively ye can deliver violence, an how effectively ye can avoid the violence uh yer enemy. A have te learn te gan from nought te violence in a split second. That’s why a needed a drink. A reckon a’ve been brought up owa soft an it’s not in me nature te hurt folk like ye sometimes need te. Cause war’s central te humanity. The government says it’s against the law te use violence an then they bomb the fuck out uh some country that won’t do as it’s told. An folk say it’s not right an we should learn te live in peace an then they vote in a government te use violence on their behalf. And the boy wondered when he had started thinking like this, because he had once been a pacifist. And then he thought it might have been a gradual change, and that maybe his acceptance of the usefulness of violence was typical of members of a population after a time of exposure to the violence of their state, or after they had lived under the example of a successfully violent state. Or maybe it came from the violence of the family. Or even earlier, from the violence of birth. Or from genetics. The sperm. The violence of the delivery. At the heart uh everythin is violence, he thought. He ordered a pint of lager from his father and he asked how he was. Busy, Malc said. Last orders.

A’ll see ye in a bit, the boy said, and he supped at his pint and looked around the faces he mostly knew as they held the changing light. He noticed the way the light came through the stray bits of hair on a girl’s otherwise smooth and lacquered head seeming to saturate each strand of hair with a misty aura. The man who had stolen the money was further down the bar. Every now and then the light outlined his features against the dark. He’s still smilen, the boy thought. He’s teken the piss out of us comen in here. The boy set his pint down on the bar and leaned on the bar and picked at his nails. In the clear white light from the canopy overhead he could see the faint striations of his thumbnail and some of the ridges were broken or had raised more during certain periods of growth in a way that evoked for him the design of a crocodile’s back. He knew he was distracting himself from what he had to do. A’m on a path, he thought, it’s not a path a’ve chosen, but the path has chosen me. The feeling he had reminded him of past incarnations of cowardice, and the thought that he might be a coward came with a tantalising sting of self-hatred. He slid his pint forward on the bar. Look after that fer uz, Dad, he said, and Malc looked at his boy as if he might say something else. The boy made his way through the crowd, and he held out his arm and waited for a man carrying drinks to get past, and the man took his time talking to someone, and the boy thought, A’m not letten ye past in acknowledgment uh some kind uh higher status, a’m politely waiten fer ye te fuck off out me way, and the boy brushed past him and went over to his target. The thief was grinning as he spoke to a man the boy didn’t recognise. He turned from his conversation. Awright, Shaun, he said. Some of his teeth were missing and he looked bloated.

What ye grinnen like that for? the boy said.

Like waah?

Ye wanna suck me dick or sumet?

The thief laughed and the boy headbutted him in the face. The blood was warm. The thief bent over holding his face and staggered through the parting crowd to the front doors leaving a trail of bright blood on the polished floor. The boy went the other way. People stood aside to let him pass and he went into the darkness of the empty function room with its empty stage and tables and steel-framed chairs that looked as though they had been abandoned in the middle of an event some decades past whose ghosts now acted before the red velvet curtains for an audience unseen and he went up the steps and into the empty toilet. He flicked the light switch. There was a hum as the lights flickered and held. The door creaked shut. It was quiet. The boy was breathing hard. He fucken deserved it, he thought, and then he spoke the words out loud. He went to the sink and looked in the mirror. There was blood on his face. It looks like warpaint, he thought, or theatrical makeup or mebe some kind uh alien symbol denoting otherness. His eyes were confused. The face in the mirror creased with pain and he looked away from it. He turned on the tap. The water felt very cold. He splashed his face to wash away the blood and he felt as though he needed validation, or he needed forgiveness, or for someone to hold him. It needed done, he said. He spat into the sink, turned on the tap to wash the spit away and the swirling water pulled it loose from the basin and spun it away. He got some paper towels and wiped his face. He looked at himself again. Cunt, he said.

It was quiet and well-lit in the main bar and the people had gone. The boy looked at the clock above the bar. He felt changed. As though he’d acquired power. The means to shape the night. His footsteps peeled off the sticky floor. Malc had on his glasses and was going through the till. He turned to the boy and gave a look somewhere between humour and concern. Where did that come frae?

Fuck knows, the boy said. Where’s everyone at?

Got rid uh them.

Cause uh me?

It was time, lad, Malc said, and he went back to the till. He lifted a metal clip and took out some notes and shuffled through them, counting out loud to himself. The boy looked around. The trail of blood had fallen like art on the polished floor and it glimmered in different places as he moved. Like a string uh Christmas lights, he thought. Malc folded the notes and pushed them into his pocket, and he flipped the metal clip and slid the drawer shut. He wrote something on a pad beside the till and he put the pen down and took off his glasses and folded them and set them on the pad.

There’s a fair bit uh blood, the boy said. De ye reckon he’ll be awright?

He’ll be awreet.

Will ye tell folk what it was for?

What’s that?

Fer nicken the money out the safe. A don’t want folk thinken a’m an arsehole an a did it fer fuck all.

Nee bother, lad. What ye haven?

A’ll have a Kronenbourg. The boy went to the bar and pulled out a stool and brushed it off and sat on it. Malc found a pint glass and held it up to the light. He tilted it under the Kronenbourg tap and flipped the handle and the golden liquid came out into the glass. He swirled it to make a head and he brought the glass upright as the head rose. He pushed the handle to finish the pint and bubbles plumed into it. He set the pint on the bar and the boy took it and had a good drink. He looked through his pint and he said, Did a look awright, ey fatha? Like a knew what a was doin? There was banging at the door. They looked at one another.

Garn see who it is, Malc said.

The boy slid off his stool and went over to the door and there was more banging. Who the fuck’s that?

Police.

He went back into the club. It’s the fucken pigs, ey fatha. What should a do?

Here, Malc said, and he came from behind the bar and waved for his boy to follow him into the dark function room, between the tables and leaning stacks of chairs, past the toilets to the fire escape. He opened the door and stuck his head out and the air came in cold as he looked around. A’d git yersel away, lad.

An the coppers cem in an had a good look about fer uz. They looked in the bogs, the kitchen, Malc’s flat, they even went up in the rafters. Malc finally telt them, when he’d given uz plenty time te escape, that a’ll uh bin long gone. They were proper pissed off wid him, apparently. Fer wasten police time. Malc thought it was funny, till the week after when they started raiden his bird’s house looken fer uz. Then he was getten it in the neck off her. So he got in touch wid laddo’s fatha an got the charges dropped, an he arranged fer uz te go an give an interview at the police station, get the case closed through lack uh evidence – ah’d never uh gone cause a never trusted the police. A thought they were tryen te lure uz back so they could fuck uz ova. But Malc was right in the end. He’s always known about that kind uh stuff – what te say te the banks, the government, the ins an outs uh the law an all that – an a suppose in the end that’s what fatha’s are for, teachen ye about the world, showen ye the right path’s not always the path ye wanna tek."

    "text": "Artie was up for workshop today, and class was in an hour. He rehearsed his bit one more time in front of the mirror, something his roommates made fun of him for. Rehearsing in front of the mirror was for actors, according to them, not comedians. It was for vain people. A good comedian was the opposite of vain, they said (though none of them seemed to know what the word for that was). Artie argued that the best comedians were those who had total control over their slightest expressions, complete self-awareness, and how did one get to complete self-awareness without observing oneself a little bit too closely for a while, without a touch of vanity?

‘That’s the whole trick,’ his roommates had said. ‘To have one and not the other.’

‘I know what you’re thinking,’ Artie said to his own face in the mirror. He thought it was a great way to open, acknowledging the audience’s doubts. ‘You’re thinking, This guy is too good-looking to be funny.’

Which was something he’d heard countless times.

‘It wasn’t always like this.’

Part of Artie’s four minutes today involved showing his classmates a blown-up photo of his teenage face (not the worst photo of him that existed, but a close contender) and pointing at different ‘problematic’ areas with a laser pen. The problematic areas were zits and crooked teeth, that kind of thing. Nothing crazy, nothing out of the ordinary. An unfortunate haircut. He’d been a bit fat, too, at the time, which wasn’t something anyone could believe when they saw him today, at twenty-four years old. He thought it would be funny, adopting a cold professor persona, presenting on his own face as if it were the map of an old battlefield, going over the forces at work, the opposing factions.

One of his roommates knocked on the bathroom door.

‘Your mom’s on the phone,’ he said.

‘I’m busy.’

‘She says it’s important.’

He pushed the door open and handed Artie the phone. Why did they even have a landline? Who was paying for this? On his way out, his roommate glanced at Artie’s teenage photo, the blown-up face printed on cardboard, and didn’t even smile at it.

‘Mom,’ Artie said into the phone. ‘It’s Wednesday. I’m rehearsing.’

‘I know, sweetheart, but Mickey’s missing.’

‘He’s not missing. He’s probably at Ethel’s.’

‘Have you heard from him?’

Wouldn’t he have told her first thing if he’d heard from his brother? Was there a joke to be made about this? Either to his mom, right now, or in general, later and for an audience, about how people didn’t think before they spoke?

‘Mickey’s a grown man,’ Artie said. ‘He’ll show up in a couple of days.’

‘That’s not the definition of a grown man,’ his mother said. ‘“Shows up eventually.”’

Wasn’t it, though? As opposed to ‘runs away from responsibility and severs all ties to start over elsewhere, never to be heard from again’? Didn’t being an adult mean pushing away that fantasy eighty times a day and judging those who gave in to it?

‘How’s Dad doing?’ Artie said.

‘Why are you asking about Dad now?’

Artie heard his father clear his throat in the background. You always thought he was going to say something, he cleared his throat so much, but Artie couldn’t remember him speaking the last few times he’d visited.

‘Well, his son is missing,’ Artie said. ‘I thought I’d ask how he’s taking it.’

‘Your father is fine. And even if he wasn’t, you think I would know? You think he would tell me? Have you met the man? You think that today, at fifty-six years old, your father is going to start expressing complex emotions?’

‘Not everything needs to be said,’ Artie said. ‘You can get a sense of how people are doing by just looking at them.’

‘He looks the same as always.’

Artie heard his father clear his throat again.

‘Is he wearing the black suit or the grey?’

‘Exactly,’ his mother said, but then caught herself right away. ‘You’re one to make fun. You always wear the same hoodie yourself. And pants, and shoes. I bet your underwear is all the same, too.’

‘Mom.’

‘You and your father, from the same cloth. A single outfit for all occasions, and incapable of expressing your feelings.’

‘I’m in the trade of expressing my feelings,’ Artie said.

‘You only tell jokes.’

‘I tell stories.’

‘You interrupt stories, is what you do. You stop when you get to the good punch line.’

‘That’s the concept,’ Artie said. ‘That’s the concept of comedy.’

‘I know, sweetheart. I like it. I like laughing. I’m just saying, the things you say onstage, they’re not stories. They’re the funny bits from larger stories. You cut your stories in a way that you never go into what’s moving about them, so I’d argue you actually do the opposite of expressing your feelings. You run away from feelings.’

‘That’s very insightful, Mom. Thank you for your critique.’

‘It’s not a critique. If you dove into your feelings onstage, you wouldn’t be funny. Feelings aren’t funny.’

‘Okay. I need to get ready now.’

‘Offstage, of course, you can tell me anything.’

‘I know.’

Artie also knew that he couldn’t end the conversation on an I know, how dismissive I knows were.

‘Mickey’s fine, Mom,’ he said. ‘Probably at Ethel’s.’

‘I don’t like that he still sees her. She’s too old for him.’

‘That’s a very retrograde thing to say.’

‘Do you think it’s my fault?’

‘What? That Mickey’s attracted to older women?’

‘That he’s an addict? I drank so much when I was pregnant with him. I was still bleeding like usual, I didn’t know I was pregnant before month four.’

Artie’d heard the whole guilt shtick before, its various built-in excuses. It wasn’t the first time Mickey had gone missing. Their mother using the word ‘addict,’ however, was a recent development. He didn’t like it. Maybe it was the word itself, though, not her saying it. ‘Addict’ made his brother sound weak, or like he was in a perfume commercial – eyes half-closed in some supermodel’s wake, unable to resist the smell coming off her dramatic neck. That’s what the word was for now. Ads. The world of commerce wanted you addicted to snacks, to apps, to some new show on TV. ‘Your New Addiction Is Here!’ – that’s how commercials went now. People in high places wanted you addicted at all times, addicted and obsessed – another word they’d managed to make the public believe had positive connotations. The product didn’t matter – in fact, the need for it disappeared the minute there was no supply left, proof that no one had ever been addicted to it in the first place. What had to be kept constant was the flow of trash to be passively ingested. But Mickey needed heroin. Not just any substance. When heroin was gone, heroin had to be found. It could not be replaced by a spin-off, or the new fragrance by Yves Saint Laurent.

Artie thought it was like rape – the word ‘rape.’ How ‘rape’ used to mean someone being dragged into an alley by a stranger, gagged, beaten up, savagely penetrated, and left for dead behind a trash can. How ‘rape’ had now come to encompass any sexual act performed without obtaining verbal consent. He was okay with that, in principle: words taking on larger meanings, larger responsibilities over time – language was a living entity, it adapted to its speakers. But then it seemed to him that when that happened, other words had to step in to fill the vacuum left by the bigger word’s promotion. He felt there should be a word for what ‘rape’ used to mean. He wondered how women who had been left for dead in alleys felt about it. The new meaning.

‘Hello? Am I boring you?’

‘No, Mom, of course not. I was just thinking.’

‘Thinking about what?’

‘Thinking about rape.’

‘Jesus, what is wrong with you?’

‘About the word “rape.”’

‘Don’t even think about using that word onstage. You can’t make fun of rape.’

‘Who said I wanted to?’

‘You don’t think about anything unless it’s for a bit.’

‘I think about Mickey pretty often, and I’ve never mentioned him onstage.’

Artie’s mother thought about it for a second.

‘That’s because addiction isn’t funny,’ she said. ‘It isn’t funny at all.’

‘Neither is rape,’ Artie said.

‘Forget about it. Just don’t ever say the word. Only women comedians can use it onstage. Women comedians who have been raped themselves.’

‘Make me a list, okay?’ Artie said. ‘A list of what I can and cannot talk about onstage. That way we don’t have to keep having these conversations.’

‘That’s a great idea. I’ll put it in an email.’

About three more minutes were devoted to saying goodbye. Artie promised his mother he’d call Ethel, see if she’d heard from Mickey, and after hanging up with her, he took his cellphone out of his pocket, thinking he would do so right away. Olivia had tried to call him, though, while his phone was on silent, and his priorities were instantly rearranged."

    "text": "He was close enough to smell the hairs on the back of the man’s neck. They almost tickled him, and he tried to rear his head, but found that he was wedged too tightly. There were too many bodies pressed heavily around him; he was slotted into a pattern of hats, shoulders, elbows, knees, feet. He could not move his head even an inch. His gaze had been slotted too, broken off at the edges: he could see nothing but the back of this man’s head, the white margin of his collar, the span of his shoulders. He was close enough to smell the pomade, streaks of it shining dully at the man’s nape; clingings of eau de cologne, a tang of salt. The suit the man was wearing was blue-and-grey check. The white collar bit slightly into his skin, fringed by small whitish hairs. His ears were pink where they curved at the top. His hat – John could see barely higher than the brim – was dark brown, with a band in a lighter shade. His hair was brown too, darker where the pomade was daubed. It had recently been cut: a line traced where the barber had shaped it.

John could not move his head. His arms were trapped at his sides; there were bodies pressing from right and left, from behind, in front. He flexed his fingers – they brushed coats, dresses, satchels, canes, umbrellas. The train carriage rattled in its frame, thudded on the track, underground. The lights wavered, trembling on the cheekbone of the man in front. John hadn’t noticed that, hadn’t noticed he could see the angle of the man’s jaw and the jut of his cheekbone. There was the hint of a moustache. Blackness rushed past the windows. The floor roared beneath his feet.

He was hard. The man had changed position, or John had. Perhaps it was only a jolt of the train. But someone had changed their position. The man’s jacket scratched at John’s stomach – he felt it as an itch – and his buttocks brushed against John’s crotch, once, twice, another time. John was hard. It was far too hot in the train, far too crowded. The man came closer, still just within the realm of accident, his buttocks now pressed against John’s crotch. John’s erection was cramped flat against his body. The man and he were so close it was cocooned between them. Surely he could feel it? A high, vanishing feeling travelled up from John’s groin, tingling in his fingertips and at his temples. He could not get away, could not turn his head, could only smell the hairs on the back of the man’s neck, see the neat line of his collar, the redness on the tops of his ears, could only feel himself hard, harder than before, as though his body were concentrating itself, straining in that one spot. Surely he could feel it? John felt panicked; sweat collected in his armpits. He dreaded the man succeeding in pivoting about, skewering the other passengers with his elbows, shouting something, the carriage turning its eyes, a gap opening round his telltale shame. And yet he knew that he did not want it to stop, that he could not escape the grip of this terrible excitement.

The man began to move. At first John was not certain, he thought again that it might be the jolting of the train. He had been willing the hardness away, counting from a hundred in his head, breathing slowly through his teeth, when he felt the slightest movement, as though the man were pushing back against his erection, as though he were gently tilting against it, rising and falling on his toes. John’s first sensation was a rush of dread, followed quickly by a rush of something else, that same high, vanishing feeling running through his fingers and up to his temples. He had no control. He was crowded on all sides – he was fixed at the centre of a mass of bodies, his entire consciousness constricted, committed to this small circle of subtle movement. This man’s buttocks, pressed so tightly against him it almost hurt, moving up and down. A bead of sweat, released from his armpit, ran quickly and coldly down his side. He tried to look about him, at the other passengers, but could not: instead he gazed frantically, surrenderingly, at the man’s collar, the redness on his ears. Was that a smile, creeping to the edge of the moustache? And still it went on, unmistakable now, the rising and falling, the pressure, almost painful, moving up the length of him, to the tip and down again. He breathed heavily through his nose, breathed heavily onto the man’s neck. He wished he could move his arms, that he could move anything at all: that his whole being were not bent so terrifyingly on this sensation, this experience, that he could for a moment place himself outside it. He breathed heavily again, saw how his breath flattened the whitish hairs on the back of the man’s neck. His face hurt. He felt a strange pressure under his ears. He swallowed, took another breath. Pomade and eau de cologne, cigarette smoke, salt. Up and down, the pressure dragged painfully to the tip, down again. He was sinking under it. He could barely breathe.

The train slowed. They were coming to a stop. He gasped onto the man’s neck. He longed for escape, for it to be over. Up and down, up and down, pleasure lancing through his body. The light changed; he saw over the man’s shoulder the brighter lights of a platform. He tried to step backwards, could not, yet. He heard the doors being opened, heard the aggravated noise of the platform, waited for the pressure to ease, for movement in the carriage, for people to depart. He longed to turn his head. But more people were pouring in, more darkness, black pressure: umbrellas, canes, satchels, dresses, coats. He and the man were forced even closer than before; he could feel the full warmth of the man’s body, the climbing curve of his back, the shoulders braced against his. And his lips were nudged onto the man’s neck; he felt the hairs on his lips, tasted the pomade and the eau de cologne. The man was still tilting against him; they were moving together now, in a slow, crushed dance, rising and falling in time.

The train pushed off, the lights quivered. It was unbearably hot. He felt faint-headed, almost in pain. And then he felt the man’s hand, a hand, unbuttoning him, felt the slight opening, an access of air, his erection pressing forward to fill it. Panic, a terrible excitement. And then the man’s hand, a hand, wriggling into the gap, struggling into it; he felt the wait of seconds to be unbearable as the hand fought through the stiffness of the tweed, found the second opening in his drawers. And then it was in, the hand, was closing round it. His eyes were closed by fear; the man’s neck was slippery beneath his lips. The carriage rattled in its frame, the lights shot darts behind his eyelids. The hand closed round it, he felt each finger find its place, begin to pull the flesh tight, to release, to guide it down into some sort of tenderness, to draw it tight again. He could barely breathe. He felt stretched tight, stretched beyond endurance. His body ached. Up and down, up and down. Fingers spanned the length of him, pulled tight, pulled faster. His hands were suddenly free, he had them on the man’s hips, was reaching up into the damp warmth inside his jacket, feeling his ribs beneath his shirt. Then down, fumbling with his buttons, cupping the swell of his cock. His hand was in the man’s trousers, the cock warm in his hand, he rubbed the head with his thumb. It was happening so fast now, up and down, faster and faster. Rising in him, through his fingertips, up to his neck, under his ears, at his temples. He was gasping. The man’s neck was wet beneath his lips.

It was like the pumping of blood from a split vein, a deep wound. He was woken by the violence of it, helplessly halfway. He squeezed his eyes shut. Air seeped past his gritted teeth and escaped at the corners of his mouth. He lay still a long moment, waiting for his nightshirt to be weighted onto his leg, for the slime to settle on his skin and begin to trickle. He was far too hot – his legs were slick with sweat, wet behind the kneecaps. Catherine was asleep, her face composed against the pillow. He peeled back the coverlet and swung his legs over the side, spreading his toes on the floorboards. The mess on the front of his shirt seemed almost to gleam; he could see one large patch, and other, smaller ones, a succession of smears. He pinched the fabric to hold it away from him and then with his other hand pulled the shirt forward from the back, over his head – this was the method he had developed after too many times pulling it up over his face, dragging the mess into his beard – and sat naked on the bed. His cock, struggling to keep its shape, drifted drunkenly between his thighs, sticky at the tip. He held it a moment, letting it cool between his fingers. The darkness in the room was filmy, as if the small amount oflight leaking through the curtains was slowly percolating it. His body was luminous; his legs and arms, even his shrinking, sluggish cock, had a greeny Renaissance sheen, like some dying Christ. He felt obvious, transparent, sacrificial, sat naked on the bed. His head hurt; his eyes were sore. Emissions exhausted him.

It must be early in the morning. Too early for the servants, who might otherwise be heard scuttling on the corridor. He looked at his nightshirt, puddled on the floor, and thought again of them having to wash it, stiff and yellow, starched with their master’s seed, four or five days a week. A succession of pungent patches, smears. He could hardly bring himself to look at Susan, who he knew collected the dirty things. If they talked about it downstairs, it was possible only that they chuckled over Mr and Mrs Addington’s honeymooning still, but he felt sure that they would be able to tell the difference between marital possession, even excessively practised, and incontinence. Servants knew."

    "text": "It began with a foxtail grass.

A foxtail grass.

The first time I noticed him he was already taller than the planks of wood supporting the rails. There wasn’t a breath of wind that day, and between the sleepers the grass stood tall and straight – chest out, stomach in – like the lead gymnast from our school years, a boy who moved with such precision that he was both admired and envied. Of course the foxtail grass had been there long before I’d paid him any attention. But though I waited for the train here at the South Shanghai Railway Station every day after work, I’d never seen him before. Perhaps the rail ties marked a sort of threshold, like the height chart at the front of the bus. Once a child grew taller than 1.20 meters, they had to purchase a ticket. The child existed before they reached that height, but in the bus ticket headcount they could be ignored.

Once the foxtail grass had made his impression on me, I began to notice other things too. A layer of moss covered both sides of the railroad tracks – some patches were dark, others light, others barely visible, as if a secret pattern had been woven into them. It was not a peaceful world under the sleepers. Several grass-like plants snaked out of the ground, reaching for the bolts on top of the ties. Occasionally a platoon of ants made an appearance, marching across the moss. The gaps between the railway sleepers were like caves to them, while the bumpy gravel below was a mountain road. By making the crossing, the ants could visit their relatives on the other side.

As it turned out, he was not the only foxtail grass. More shot up, stubbornly, at different points along the platform. There were more on the side where the passengers stood. Some grew well beyond the stumps of the sleepers and approached the height of the platform. Even though they were close enough to brush my shoes, I hadn’t noticed them until now.

After that first encounter, I began to enjoy waiting for the train after work. Each day the foxtail grass, like an excited adolescent, would exclaim, ‘Look! I’ve grown again!’ The various components of the track all served as markings to measure his increased height.

One day, the foxtail grass – the very first one, the one that had lured me into his world – swayed past a dangerous mark. I worried about his fate. Clutching my purse, I glanced at the countdown on the screen – there was only a minute left until the train arrived. The foxtail grass was still clinging to the track, dozing greedily. The far end of the track began to glow, as if there were tiny lamps hanging from either side, lighting up, one after another. Wake up, I murmured, or you will be chopped down. The foxtail grass did not budge, and the people around me started to rub their palms together, preparing themselves to compete for a good spot. This was the terminal station. An empty train arrived. Whoever got on first would enjoy a comfortable ride for some time.

All at once I had a vision of the train as an endless line of pregnant women, all of them in active labor. As the train pulled in, the women were thrust onto the operating table, emitting long, painful screams. The foxtail grass was gone. The women were cut open and gutted. People shoved their way in, reaching for flesh. Nobody seemed to care about the babies in their bellies.

‘You getting on or what? Move out of the way!’ I was pushed aside. A cacophony of footsteps – like thunder, like drumbeats, like pile-driving. The lights on the train doors started to flicker at the same pace, accompanied by an urgent ‘beep beep beep’, as if something had gone wrong in surgery. Then, before I could understand what was happening, the open bellies closed up, like it had all been a bizarre performance. With another long, painful roar, the women were pushed to the next operating table. In their roar, I somehow sensed a note of exhilaration.

Once the last woman had been sent away, the foxtail grass sprang back up. How flexible – he had bent down to one side beneath the moving train. He seemed to recognize me, his witness, and showed off his agility by twisting his body. I cracked a smile. Then, seeing the uniformed staff patrolling the platform, I resumed my flat expression and stepped back.

‘I’m waiting for a friend,’ I said, not sure why I felt the need to explain.

The man walked on without a pause. Six minutes and fifty-eight seconds until the next train. Besides me and the metro staff, the only other person there was a man in his forties. Perhaps he was actually waiting for someone. I sat down next to him, leaving an empty seat between us.

‘You noticed the plant too?’ he asked, out of the blue.

‘What plant?’ As if caught playing a prank by a parent, my default reaction was to deny everything.

He leaned his head closer. ‘The plant that looks like a foxtail grass.’

‘Isn’t that a foxtail grass?’ As soon as I’d said this, I knew I was exposed.

The man’s eyes looked very small behind his thick glasses. He was balding, with a few tufts of hair holding up the facade. I had a sense that he was well educated, cultured and understanding, so I didn’t feel bad about my earlier denial.

He said the plant was a tropical species, originally found in Sumatra, but in recent years it had also been spotted in non-tropical regions around the world. He mentioned the scientific name of the plant, but I forgot it as soon as he’d said it. I still only call the plant ‘the foxtail grass’.

‘It’s difficult to remember,’ he said, with a smile. ‘It’s okay if you don’t. Back in college, we’d repeat the scientific names like the names of our relatives, and once we’d memorized them they did feel like our relatives!’

I smiled back.

‘I can tell you just started working,’ he continued. ‘You haven’t been worn down by life –’

The corners of his mouth drooped, and he waved his hand. He told me about the plant’s personality. It felt like he was talking about a close friend: ‘He’s very good at adapting to changes,’ the man explained. ‘That’s why he can bend over completely with such short notice. In the tropics he uses this posture to prey on flies and mosquitoes, stretching out like a lizard’s tongue. That is his instinct.’

I liked the foxtail grass even more now that I knew he hunted flies and mosquitoes.

‘We used to keep the plants in our dorm rooms, and thanks to them we were free from mosquitoes all summer long.’

We only got to exchange a few more sentences before people started to fill the benches. Most passengers stood by the edge of the platform, ready to pounce. Through the gaps between their legs, I could still see the foxtail grass.

 

With each passing day, the South Shanghai Railway Station became more like a jungle. The patches of moss gradually connected into a vast carpet. The foxtail grass grew taller. As much as I welcomed the change, I couldn’t help but worry.

The scholarly man and I took the same train most days. We didn’t talk – just nodded at each other before turning our gaze to the lush garden. Over time, we heard more and more grumbling voices.

‘Look how wild the weeds are getting,’ a woman in her fifties sighed. ‘No one cleans under the tracks anymore.’

I thought this was just an isolated complaint, but it seemed to resonate.

‘That’s why,’ another woman echoed, ‘the trains keep getting slower.’

‘And they break down all the time,’ said another. There seemed to be a tacit understanding among people of that age group in Shanghai. One by one, they picked up the conversation.

‘Somebody has to do something. So many bugs.’ A plump lady in her sixties lifted her chiffon pants.

An ominous feeling gripped me. There were two rows of red bumps on her pale, chubby legs. She scratched them generously. Before long, the itching seemed to spread like an epidemic across the platform.

‘I also got bitten there!’ someone else cried. Soon, everyone was touching mosquito bites they’d got yesterday or the day before. Those who didn’t have bites scratched imaginary ones. I stood still and looked around, feeling as if I were in a rainforest surrounded by well-dressed monkeys. I looked at the scholarly man. His thick glasses, like mirrors, blocked my gaze. Neither of us mentioned that the plants killed mosquitoes.

The next afternoon, when I returned to wait for my train, the tracks had been cleared of grass. They looked awkward and strange – like a friend who’d long worn a beard shaven clean. I felt this was as much the result of my silence as the complaints of the older passengers.

The foxtail grass was gone, this time forever. I stared at the countdown on the screen. From time to time, I stomped my feet to ward off the mosquitoes that came to feed.

 

Ayear passed, and another summer ended. Typhoons came one after another to herald the approaching autumn. On pouring days, the heavy curtains of rain hanging from the roof of the shelter kept passengers in check more effectively than the yellow lines on the platform.

Given the weather, I was not surprised to see a puddle forming under the tracks. I didn’t pay much attention to it, even when the puddle lingered through a few sunny days.

‘There, look!’ The scholarly man had walked up to me. He shoved his glasses up onto his bald forehead, then left with a mysterious smile.

He hadn’t pointed in any particular direction, but I could sense he meant the puddle. The geometric patterns of the station’s half-open dome reflected on the water, much like a neatly divided paddy field, with a few red dots bouncing in the center.

A few red dots.

Like camellias blooming in the early spring, only they were hidden in the field. After a moment, they shook again, like stage lights tracking performers, flicking on and off for special effects.

I wondered what these red dots were.

‘Piranhas!’ Two days later, the scholarly man leaned into my ear again. ‘First found in the Amazon River basin, typically no larger than a human hand, they can gnaw an adult cow to the bone!’

My face turned the color of bone.

‘Don’t worry,’ he kept whispering, ‘they can’t bite through metal. Besides, they live in the water and don’t mess with life on land. I’ve kept these fish as pets for years.’

I tried not to let the piranhas’ nature bother me. Slowly I came to embrace their existence. Much like in the foxtail grass days, I found that I enjoyed having something to look at. The rainy days now felt meaningful. I no longer worried about that unsheltered moment before boarding; I didn’t mind when rainwater fell from other people’s umbrellas, dripping onto my business skirt. The piranhas craved the rain, and I too felt as if I were living in the puddle, thanking the rain for nourishing the earth.

I liked to watch the raindrops rippling across the puddle, and the piranhas thrashing to the surface for a drink. I’d even miss a few trains so that I could sit and watch them. In October, a week of intermittent rain caused the water to rise, heaving the piranhas closer towards the approaching trains.

‘Don’t worry.’ The scholarly man stood next to me. ‘They are not as stupid as people think.’ Ever since the arrival of the piranhas, we had grown close again.

I didn’t respond, but kept staring at the puddle. The moment the tracks began to vibrate, the piranhas vanished under the water. Only once the roaring train had passed – now carrying the bustling crowds – did the red dots start to dart around again, reminding me of the fireflies from the countryside that a city girl like me had never had the chance to see.

‘I love them,’ the scholarly man said. ‘They’re extraordinarily dangerous, but the danger only adds to their charm.’

I kept nodding.

It was happening slowly, but the piranhas were growing. Once as tiny as a pen tip, by November they were as thick as a brush dipped in vermilion and dotted on the black puddle, spreading lines of red silk. I worried that in a few more weeks they’d be fully rouge – so dense they wouldn’t dissolve.

Perhaps most people killed time at the station by staring at the countdown on the screen. If they did see the red dots, maybe they assumed they were reflections from something in the station’s dome. But I knew it wouldn’t be long before the piranhas were discovered. I sensed that a countdown for their survival at the bottom of the puddle had begun.

On the weekends I grew anxious about not being able to go to work. The last time I’d felt this way was back in my school years, when I would count the hours until I could see my crush again on Monday morning. That was an innocent time, before the internet and mobile phones.

Then one Saturday, I found myself riding an empty train to the South Shanghai Railway Station. The sky and clouds were reflected in the puddle, creating a black-and-white negative. The fish were tinting the clouds red. Engrossed, I didn’t notice the scholarly man sitting down beside me on the bench.

‘Mesmerizing, isn’t it?’ he asked.

‘Yes.’ I didn’t hide my feelings anymore. ‘But once they are discovered –’

‘It doesn’t matter if they stay here, right?’ he continued. ‘They don’t cost taxpayers anything, and they won’t harm people. Whoever sees them gets to own them.’

The metro staff walked past, and the man fell silent. The piranhas seemed to smell the danger, sinking into the water, leaving a faint red on the surface. The less observant would assume it was just a reflection of the setting sun.

I didn’t say I was waiting for a friend this time.

Not many people were at the station on weekends – only passers-by with clear destinations in their minds and large suitcases in their hands. We were the only two keeping those beautiful light rail residents company.

 

No one has been able to explain to me how exactly the piranhas were discovered. Perhaps someone sold the lives of these fish to the local newspaper in exchange for a small cash reward. Perhaps the same loud and fussy passengers, talking about their new discoveries and conspiracy theories, alerted the staff. Or perhaps a curious child alarmed her parents . . .

In short, a TV crew came, and their flashlights frightened the fish into jumping around in their cramped puddle. The light rail train was suspended by the startled authorities. People who weren’t in a rush to get to work crowded around the platform. They stood on the outermost layer, as the inside was packed with reporters, metro staff, police, and so-called experts. Nobody was sure what they were looking at.

Of course I missed all this. It happened in the late morning, when I was already at work in my cubicle. All I could do was imagine the scene based on the rumors that were spreading through the city. Something was happening at the South Shanghai Railway Station. Some people theorized, quite reasonably, that someone had jumped onto the tracks. The story spread, and eventually acquired an element of truth when the presence of the piranhas was revealed.

‘The person who died,’ my co-worker told me the next day over coffee, ‘was bitten to the bone by piranhas. How horrible – can you imagine?’

‘It’s true,’ another co-worker joined in. ‘My cousin Wang was on the platform at the time.’

Even after the media had clarified that there had been no suicide, news of the piranha murder incident continued to sweep the city. I had to extinguish any hope I’d reserved for the fish: the loss of a human life – even an imaginary one – would have to be atoned for.

For the first few days, the government only reported that piranhas had been found at the South Shanghai Railway Station and that the incident had been properly handled. Because the government had failed to determine the origin of the fish, people turned their energy to uncovering who had brought them to the station. Reporters visited pet markets around the city to interview store owners about the sale of piranhas.

For a week or so my TV screen was filled with these interviews:

‘Did the customers who bought the piranhas know that these fish are dangerous?’

‘Of course they knew. They’re piranhas!’

I imagined people sitting in front of their TVs, saying to their families: ‘They knew this and they still bought the fish. How twisted!’ I imagined them chewing fish as they watched the news, spitting out the bones skillfully.

In the end, the real world always finds a way to live up to rumor. Two weeks after the piranha murder incident, the news ran a story about a middle-aged man whose forefinger had been bitten off by his pet piranhas. The man’s face was pixelated. The police clarified that this case was not related to what had happened in the South Shanghai Railway Station. But I was sure that some angry people somewhere would convince themselves otherwise, concluding that the man on TV had released the piranhas in an attempt to kill all the residents of Shanghai.

Eventually I stopped watching the news. My studio apartment felt much darker and quieter than the world outside.

I have not seen the scholarly man since the piranhas were exposed.

    "text": "Before it occurred, the drama on the Piccadilly Line, I was one of those people employed to clean up the radio archives at the BBC. I’d written a book called Muriel Spark and the Comedy of Fact and was still smarting from the silence surrounding its publication. People talk such garbage about failure. They say it’s the attempt that counts, that failure is a great teacher. All I know is that success improves your life, and when it doesn’t come you’re left with a sense of premeditated injury. I joined a part-time MA in journalism at City University, where some of the students had tattoos, nose rings and pale blue hair. We yearned to report on the inner reaches of ourselves. All data was of course credit data. All reporting was surveillance. In good journalism you get to see what happened, but in the best you also get to see what might have happened instead.

‘You guys want to believe that stories belong to the people they’re about,’ the professor said one cold evening in the lecture hall, ‘but that’s just not true. History is merely a chronology of accidents and journalism a perpetual clean-up operation.’ His accent was strong. Welsh. The hall smelled of damp wool. The students seemed super-alert. Outside the window, the lights of Clerkenwell glowed through the rain.

‘I don’t think so,’ the young woman sitting in front of me said. Professor Madoc behaved as if all opposition was enjoyable. You had the impression he kept his deepest professional experiences to himself, and that he doubted your capacity for reality. I admired him, perhaps more than I should have. I like the idea that minds improve by confronting difficulty, not by meeting reassurance.

‘Look out for that form of sentimentality known as privacy,’ he said to the hall. ‘It’s redundant. Your job, your only job, is to expose the truth, with no regard for special interests, the special interests of corporations as much as individuals.’

‘I’m not sure that’s right,’ I said, with my hand up (an old habit). ‘Surely it’s not okay to harm or offend people just to get information?’

He came straight back at me. ‘Offence is merely a by-product of good reporting,’ he said. ‘People’s feelings are irrelevant.’

‘That’s over the top,’ I said to the students rather than to him.

‘Speak up!’ he shouted. ‘I can take it.’

‘That’s really questionable,’ I said, a little louder. ‘You’re making it sound like reporting is a form of exploitation.’

‘You’re saying you can’t cope with it?’

‘You’re framing the whole thing as an immoral act.’

I couldn’t tell if the other students knew that Madoc and I had become friendly. I was a little older and already hired by a corporation, which may have annoyed them. He had a tendency to pick me out. Over drinks, he had told me I should be thinking about long-form. I suppose most of them imagined we were just two blokes in a competition to mansplain, but Madoc could be insightful. I thought he could help me.

‘In a time when all information is gathered and controlled by potentially bad actors,’ he said, ‘we can still believe in the power of the individual witness to circumvent that control. I don’t know if you believe that, Mr McAllister. You’re from the United States, no?’

‘I won’t deny it,’ I said, putting down my pencil. ‘Philadelphia.’

‘Home of The Philadelphia Inquirer. Well, people either believe in journalism or they don’t, Michael. They either like the truth, or they hate it. Some of you want to be activists, yet you’re frightened of offending anyone. But, let me tell you: objectivity takes a degree of courage, and this business is not a niceness contest. It’s brutal. It should be brutal.’ I think the students were put off by his categorical way of speaking. Some of them looked at me, as if I might know how to make him less like that.

There was a loner-guy in the second row. That evening, he seemed especially agitated, pulling his headphones on and off, the music suddenly blaring from his cans while Madoc continued to speak. There’s nothing more insistent than other people’s music. It was a jagged sound, thrash metal or whatever, and its discordance began to feed an anxiety already there in the room. ‘Fucking bullshit!’ the guy shouted, pushing the headphones back on.

‘I think you should leave the hall,’ Madoc said.

‘Like you know anything.’

‘Just leave.’

The guy provoked confrontation yet seemed to hate the attention. I’d often see him craning round to look at me during the class. A week on, it must have been him that stuck a Post-it note on the bench where I sat. I found it when I came in and could see the back of his head, nodding with his cans on. Then he laid his head on his folded arms for the whole hour. ‘SPEAK UP!’ the note said.

 

I’d come to Broadcasting House after two years at HarperCollins as a sensitivity reader. By my count, I’d saved twenty-six authors from making jerks of themselves or being cancelled, and now I was in this open-plan office on the fourth floor, trying to sort out the archives of Desert Island Discs. Archive cleansing was hardly my life’s ambition – a frontline assignment was the aim, or a serial podcast – but they allowed me to work flexible hours, and it calmed the mind to be assessing old recordings and listening to the variously intelligent and prejudiced questions of Roy Plomley and Sue Lawley.

‘What’ve we got?’ my boss Lillian asked me one morning, as she peeled a banana by my desk.

‘Well, there’s the interview with Ian Fleming from 1963 –’

‘What’s wrong with it?’

I looked down at the notes in my iPhone. My habit was to listen everywhere, at the shaving mirror, in bed at night, jogging at Fitness First, and the stuff I noted was relevant and to the point.

‘The way he describes the sex life of James Bond. Might sound a bit rapey.’

‘Oh, really?’

‘The problem’s the presenter. He says how lucky it was for 007 to be meeting “these lovely and cooperative girls”.’

‘Oh dear.’

‘Like, can we even say “cooperative”?’

Lillian went to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.

‘It suggests a certain amount of coercion,’ I continued.

She found the page. ‘Working together, acting jointly,’ she said, looking up. ‘It says “willing”.’

I told her I thought it would be safer to cut the question. The archives were full of holes and omissions – missing tracks, speech breaking off, material lost or damaged. Deletions in the recordings were unlikely to be noticed.

Broadcasting House is filled with old sound. When I walked the corridors and peered into the empty studios, there was always something of a distinguished echo, a combination of past laughter and bulletins. Maybe the cue lights on the green baize offered a sense of occasion. Nostalgia. The air in all those rooms and in the entire building was tense with spoken things, as if what had been said on the airwaves still lingered in particles and spores. That’s how it struck me anyhow. You think you can hear Orwell and the 1930s poets, and there remains in the elevator lobbies the smell of shoe polish and stewed tea.

Our section – the Department of Misspeaking, as our waggish colleague Nicholas Winslow-Brown called it – was one of the newer ones sprouting up all over the place. Lillian used to work on the Today programme, and she had been seconded to us, aged sixty-four. She had incredible news sense and you had to admire her experience. Nick was an archivist of sorts. He cycled in from South Norwood three days a week. His life’s passion, if that’s not too strong a word, was British comedians of the 1970s. He never found anything offensive: all subjects were good for a laugh. He collected old recording equipment and could bore you out of your mind when talking about radio frequencies. He was the God of Easy Listening, but his lightness made us grave.

‘Okay. What else?’ Lillian asked me.

‘I’m not sure it’s cool that Joseph Cotten says he once kicked Hedda Hopper in the ass. Random violence towards women. And . . .’

I scrolled down my list of notes.

‘Victoria Wood introducing a track by the Weather Girls? She describes them as “two enormous black women”?’

‘Yes, cut that.’

‘And the novelist Beryl Bainbridge saying women can never be equal to men.’

‘She was eccentric,’ Lillian remarked. ‘Nobody could take that seriously.’

‘It’s up to you.’

‘I understand the task, Michael,’ she said.

Lillian was inconsistent. She wanted the Corporation to meet improved standards, but she wasn’t persuaded by my own efforts. She said I had the brain of a single man and that I reasoned like somebody who didn’t have kids. She wasn’t wrong but her remarks were inappropriate, I thought.

‘There’s an interview here from 1968,’ I said, ‘with Louis Armstrong. Fairly upsetting.’

‘I’m really not keen to cut a contributor of colour,’ Lillian told me. ‘We have too few, especially from those years.’

‘Of course,’ I said, swiping to get to the offending section.

‘You’re about half the size you were when I last saw you,’ the interviewer was saying. ‘I’ve been getting too much to eat,’ Armstrong replied, ‘but I’ve learned the psychology of leaving it all behind me every morning. You understand?’

Lillian was nodding. The interview continued.

‘You don’t need it after the taste is gone,’ Armstrong added.

I stopped the recording and scanned Lillian’s exhausted face. ‘That sounds like an advertisement for bulimia,’ I said.

 

Two weeks later, the thing started. I was perched at the counter of a sushi place in Regent Street, when suddenly I got the feeling I was being watched. When I looked up from my tray, there he was – the loner-guy from City. I’d like to say his presence was unexpected, but somehow it wasn’t. He sat down on the stool next to me, licking a cigarette paper and blinking crazily. I say crazily: I don’t mean to judge him, but he absolutely seemed like he had mental-health problems. When he spoke, it became clear that he had this little fund of second-hand knowledge; he knew, for instance, that Professor Madoc was married with kids, and he knew about my work with the BBC, casually dropping it into the conversation as if gathering such information was a hobby of his.

‘How do you know that?’ I asked.

‘It’s on your Instagram bio, dude,’ he replied. ‘It’s not rocket science. You were a sensitivity boffin for a major publishing house.’

He spoke about ‘testing reality’ and ‘making things happen’. When he lit the cigarette he’d been rolling, the manager came over and asked him to leave. Pointing at me, the student said it was stupid to trust pilots from countries where they believe in the afterlife. ‘I’m telling you, brother,’ he said, ‘when it comes to pilots, you’re much safer when they don’t.’

The manager started jostling him. ‘Let’s move,’ he said.

‘People’s minds, man,’ the student said. ‘You never really know what’s going on in there, do you?’

That afternoon, Lillian wanted to go over some of the fixes. Winslow-Brown was with us, serving as comedy’s great advocate. Her desk overlooked All Souls Church on Langham Place, with Regent Street beyond. ‘The word has come down,’ she said. ‘We need to incline more towards Michael’s approach.’

Nick cocked his head and smiled. ‘Expunge all the bad attitudes?’

‘I don’t like it either,’ Lillian said. ‘Desert Island Crimes. The Big Bigots Conventicle. I feel like we’re rubbing out history, all in the name of –’

‘Social awareness?’ I offered.

Nick sniggered into his travel mug of coffee.

Lillian tapped a pencil on the edge of her desk. ‘Well done,’ she said. ‘Management is happy with what we’re doing. I don’t pass all your suggestions up the line. I tend to agree with Nick, that human nature is not improved by concealment, especially when it comes to the past. But management wants a bit more . . . Em, attentiveness. Your latest points . . .’

She touched her laptop and read aloud. ‘. . . Sondheim is belligerent, defensive, immodest.’

‘And that’s now considered out of order, is it?’ Nick asked. ‘That’s now banned, a person demonstrating his character?’

‘It would appear so,’ Lillian said.

I tried to adopt a more junior tone. ‘Guys. You employ me to listen and tell you what I think. My notes are only suggestions.’

Lillian flicked her trackpad. ‘Yes. I listened last night to a few of the latest things you flagged. Natalie Wood speaking in a faux Mexican accent. “You dirty gringos, et cetera”. She’s having a bit of a joke, no?’

‘Possibly,’ I said. ‘But 150 million Mexicans aren’t laughing.’

She nodded, reading on. ‘The travel writer Wilfred Thesiger. He talks about areas of Arabia being “pacified”. He shot lions in the Sudan.’

‘I’ve heard that one,’ Nick said, his bottom lip out. ‘Isn’t it all about sweet-smelling roses at the edge of the desert, the beauty of shifting sands?’

‘That’s not the worrying part,’ I said. ‘We don’t punish clichés.’

‘He’s a type,’ Lillian said, staring at her screen. ‘We can’t uninvent him.’

‘It’s just over, I guess.’ I was trying not to sound irked. ‘A white man, schooled at Eton, trying to be funny about the dance moves of Ethiopians. I don’t know how harmful it is, but I can tell you it’s offensive.’

‘Rex Harrison,’ she continued, ‘ticked off for blacking up in a play by Eugene O’Neill.’

‘Not for doing it,’ I said, ‘that’s none of our business. For talking about it light-heartedly on a programme we are making available for rebroadcast.’

‘Quite so,’ she said, with a tight smile. Lillian seemed to hate her job and blamed me for helping her to do it properly.

‘Roald Dahl, of course. Everybody’s taking great chunks out of Roald Dahl.’

‘For fuck’s sake!’ Nick said. ‘He was an entertainer.’

‘And so were the Black and White Minstrels,’ I said, ‘but you’re not proposing to stream them all over the place, are you?’

 

My father used to say the important stuff happens when you’re looking the other way. You’re fast asleep or busy worrying about the car insurance or what to cook for dinner. I’m not sure I can agree with him. I trained myself early on to recognise big events, and keep my own preferences out of the picture. News is like that: it’s other people, most of the time, though I increasingly fear that everything’s subjective. I mean, you arrange your perspective according to who you think you are.

In the late 1980s, my father learned his people were related to the abolitionist who owned the McAllister farm south-east of Gettysburg. He visited the US from Scotland in search of his American roots, and he met my mother in Philadelphia. They went to work for The Inquirer. He left us on my sixteenth birthday. He returned to the UK and to a sort of oblivion. When I was in my senior year at Yale, I received a letter in which he said there were too many things he didn’t get right. ‘Your mother deserved better than me,’ he wrote, ‘but I just couldn’t make it and I’m sorry about that.’ When he died, his second wife sent me a freezer bag containing a tartan scarf and a harmonica. ‘I thought you might like these,’ her note said. ‘Your father was always sad not to have known you better.’

I left Broadcasting House at three o’clock that day and walked down to St James’s Square, where I sat on a bench under the plane trees, making notes on an episode from 1979. ‘Is it okay for the playwright Peter Shaffer to talk about possessing the spiritual essence of the Inca?’ I walked over to Haymarket to get coffee and was aware of eyes at a certain point: a familiar person passing by, then a clear view of him, the guy from class. It was like he wanted to look at me or say something, and I was confused by it and sort of spaced out. If you’re built for it, all attention is a sort of aphrodisiac. He disappeared again and it was close to five when I got to the underground station. A guitarist was playing in the tunnel and the music echoed. On the crowded platform, I heard the shots. People ran and screamed. I took out my phone.

‘Oh my God! He’s going to shoot people!’

I remember a woman yelling that. A train came in on the other platform and everyone rushed towards it as I saw him firing at the ceiling.

I was already filming when he walked towards me. It was as if the commotion was soothing to him. One of the Transport for London workers was shouting into a digital loud hailer. ‘All passengers please clear the platform!’

The student turned to me, stepping closer.

‘I’ll record it for you,’ I said. ‘Don’t shoot.’

‘It’s hard to work out the maths and the physics,’ he said casually. ‘The acoustics, I mean. Trying to figure out what’s right.’

There was a pinkness to his eyes. He wore a backpack and jerked the gun in the direction of the steps.

‘Just science,’ he said.

I stared at him. My hand was shaking. He was careful in the way he reached into his backpack – he had fingerless, mesh gloves – and put what I think was another cartridge into the gun and hammered it in with his palm.

‘Keep your camera on,’ he said.

My eyes tried to focus, and the place seemed emptier. I can remember the posters behind him and the noise of an alarm going off.

‘Stop this,’ I said. It came out as a whisper.

He seemed exhausted. He seemed like he’d overthought everything. I remember how he let his firing arm flop down to his side. He walked closer and I thought I was finished, but all he did was hand me a plastic key card.

‘Room 204. Premier Inn. Heathrow. Terminal 3,’ he said.

I put the card immediately into my pocket. There was a sound of radio crackles, and I could see a number of people coming up behind him.

‘Thank you,’ he said. ‘Sometimes you need help.’

I lifted the phone with a sense of purpose, using my thumb and forefinger to zoom in on his face. He looked sensitively into the camera before raising the gun again, at which point he was pulled by several people to the ground.

 

They’ve had a bunch of war reporters on Desert Island Discs. The photojournalist Don McCullin was one, interviewed in 1984. He spoke of being in Beirut a year earlier trying to photograph a woman. ‘She was very cross, and she punched me,’ he said. The woman then went round the corner and was killed by a car bomb. ‘I wished the woman would have punched me ten times as hard,’ he said, ‘to somehow exonerate my misjudgement that day.’ A lot of the other reporters who came on the show are now forgotten, people like Godfrey Talbot, a broadcaster who had been embedded with allied troops at El Alamein and Cassino. ‘I don’t know of any assignment that is so rugged as a major royal tour,’ he said, with what I take to be a 1950s sense of proportion.

Nobody was hurt that day at Piccadilly Circus. The young guy was arrested. I don’t know what to say about randomness or predestination or whatever. When they took him away, a female officer asked if I was okay, and I nodded. They would check the CCTV, I supposed, and have more questions later. The station was closed and cordoned off, so I couldn’t take the Tube to my destination. It was dark when I emerged onto Piccadilly, into the blue lights. I was worried the police might come at any moment and take my phone away for analysis. I emailed the footage to Madoc, and hailed a cab on Haymarket, feeling the guy’s key card in my pocket.

I had reached Hammersmith when Madoc called.

‘Are you okay?’ he asked. ‘You were right there, man. That’s the nutter from our class.’

‘Yes,’ I said. ‘I saw everything.’

‘That’s insane. Was he trying to . . . ?’

There was nothing to say to him. It was all on the recording. What the guy did and what he didn’t do and what he might have done. The police later found him on CCTV footage from weeks before, asking the security guard at Broadcasting House how to get work in the media. He posted screeds about our course on Reddit. The police would say he’d sent me an email after reading my first published article in Prospect, but I never saw it. They now say he was a fitness fanatic who had spent months trying to buy a firearm. He’d put a message about me in a BBC suggestions box. ‘The guy wants to be a reporter,’ it said, ‘and he needs a story.’

‘There’s obviously something wrong with him,’ Madoc said that night, ‘but I didn’t think he was capable of anything like this. Where are you now?’

I didn’t tell him. He asked me what I wanted to do with the video. I wasn’t sure. ‘I know a producer at CNN here in London,’ he said. ‘They’ll pay you for it, but they’ll want to interview you as well.’

Passing over the Hammersmith Flyover, we encountered roadworks. They drowned out most of what Madoc was saying. I told him to take care of the footage. He should do whatever he thought was right.

He was waiting for me to say something else. ‘Do you want me to come and get you?’

‘I’m good,’ I said.

‘We just don’t know what’s in people’s minds.’

I think that’s what he said. That’s what the guy had said, too.

 

Unless you happen to enjoy the journey to a journey, the airport run feels like the first link in a chain of dislocation. The short-term parking, the shuttle between terminals, the say-hello-wave-goodbye routine of coffee bars and trinket shops: it makes you wonder if you were ever on solid ground. Going down the M4 feels austere. I think of those highways as among the final staging posts of royal funerals, where the mourners line the route as the cortège makes its way from the historic centre to the resting place.

Terminal 3 had an atmosphere of purpose. Maybe it was the drag of wheelie-suitcases over wet gravel. The smokers outside the building looked like they were going everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Piccadilly already seemed like an urban myth. The cab had dropped me off at the terminal building, so I walked past multi-storey car parks to find the hotel. When I reached it, the Premier Inn felt like a place I’d been getting to know all my life.

I knew I had to reach the room before the police got wind of it and turned up to investigate. I went straight past reception and up in the elevator to the second floor. At 204, a ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign hung on the door handle; the lock was released with a knowing click. Inside: drawn curtains. The bedside lights were on, and the bed looked as if it hadn’t been slept in, but there was an impression on the white duvet, just about my length and with a dent in the pillow. I found a pair of AirPods in the bathroom and put them in my pocket. A computer charger was plugged into the wall and a neat pile of books sat on the desk. Open by itself was a copy of my own book, held flat by a mug of cold tea.

    "text": "I’m a humble writer who recently published a pair of short stories in two relatively unknown literary journals. The first story was 3,587 characters, which includes punctuation marks. The second story was a bit longer, coming in at 4,623 characters, also including punctuation marks.

I’m getting ready to write a novel based on a few ideas that have been living inside my mind for the past twenty-odd years. The ideas aren’t the best neighbors; not only do they not get along with each other, but they often get into fights. I know they’re all vying to be the ‘first written’ out of my mind and onto paper. I try to persuade them that being the ‘first written’ isn’t as important as being ‘well written’. But they lack confidence in my writing ability. According to them, I’ve only got one novel in me. They’re afraid that if they don’t make it out first, they will end up dying in incubation. Thanks to their incessant arguing, I haven’t been able to write a single character in twenty years. Of course, this is merely an excuse. The real reason is my lack of confidence in ever getting my novel published.

One afternoon twenty years ago, I cautiously stepped through the gate of a famous publishing house. Following the mottled cement staircase up to the fifth floor, I gently knocked on the unlatched door of the editorial office for literature. A woman’s voice responded:

‘Come in.’

I pushed open the door and went in. Although there were a dozen desks in the room, there were only two people inside, a man and a woman. The male editor looked to be in his early twenties while the woman was around forty. The woman asked me:

‘Who are you looking for?’

I was at a loss as I stared at the tall pile of unopened packages of manuscripts stacked up on the desk. There was another batch of manuscripts stacked up in the corner of the room. The young male editor was sitting beside the desk closest to the door. Seeing that all the manuscripts on his desk were addressed to someone named Sun Qiang, I said:

‘I’m here to see Sun Qiang.’

The female editor pointed to the male editor and said: ‘He’s Sun Qiang.’

The editor named Sun Qiang looked at me in confusion. He couldn’t remember ever having seen me before. I flashed him a modest smile before taking out of my backpack copies of the two journals that had previously published my short stories. I opened them up to the page where my stories appeared and handed them to him, pointing out which one was my first published work and which was the second. He glanced at the magazines before asking:

‘What do you want?’

I said I had a few ideas for a novel that I wanted to bounce off him; if he was interested in any of them, I could go home and get right to work. I pulled up a chair and sat down, preparing to tell him all about my ideas when he interrupted me:

‘Hey, I’m not a doctor.’

I was a bit taken aback. Not understanding what he meant, I hesitated for a moment before going on to tell him about my first idea. I only got through the first two sentences when he interrupted me again:

‘Didn’t I just tell you, I’m not a doctor at some medical clinic!’

‘I know,’ I began to grow uneasy. ‘You’re a literary editor.’

That’s when someone with a woven plastic bag came in to collect the recyclables. He seemed to be close with the editors because he pointed to the pile of manuscripts in the corner and said:

‘Not too many today.’

With that, he squatted down to dump the manuscripts into the woven plastic bag. Meanwhile, Sun Qiang got up and walked out. He didn’t bother giving me a second look; it was as if I didn’t even exist. I sat there awkwardly for a moment before the female editor said:

‘Why don’t you head home? You can send us your manuscript when it’s done.’

I nodded. Glancing at the person in the corner who was still filling the garbage bag with unopened manuscripts, I got up and walked out of the office. Standing on the street, staring back at this famous publishing house, I knew what the fate of my ideas would be if I ever sent them here. They would be crammed into that woven plastic garbage bag, and sold to a recycling center to be made into new paper.

Later, I went to a not-so-famous publishing house where I met an editor in his fifties. While he stopped short of saying ‘I’m not a doctor’, he also had no interest in listening to my ideas. While his attitude was much friendlier than Sun Qiang’s, he still just briefly thumbed through the copies of those two relatively unknown literary journals I brought and told me frankly that it is extremely difficult for an unknown author to publish a novel. Seeing my dejected response, he offered a smile and asked:

‘Do you want to write to be famous, or do you have a real passion for literature?’

‘I have a true passion for literature,’ I responded without hesitation.

‘Then that’s going to be difficult,’ he said. ‘If you want, you can try the route of self-publishing. That involves paying us to issue an ISBN and then finding a printer. You could print around 500 copies to give to your relatives and friends.’

What he said perked my interest so I asked: ‘How much is an ISBN number? What would it cost to print 500 copies of a book?’

‘The ISBN will set you back 15,000 RMB; 500 copies will cost around 5,000 RMB to print. You’re looking at 20,000 to publish your book.’

‘Wow, so expensive!’ I cried. At the time my monthly salary was only 200 RMB.

‘When independent book publishers purchase ISBNs from us, we charge them 20,000. We only offer them 15,000 a title when they buy more than ten from us at a time.’ He paused for a moment: ‘I’m actually offering you our bulk rate.’

‘I don’t understand, why would independent publishers need to purchase ISBNs from you?’

‘Only legitimate state-owned publishers are permitted to issue ISBN numbers. Private enterprises technically aren’t allowed to run publishing houses, so they have to purchase ISBN numbers from state-owned publishers.’

‘And what if I don’t want the ISBN number and just publish my novel on my own by going directly to a printer?’

‘That would be considered an illegal publication.’

‘Is that dangerous?’

‘Well, they could arrest you and throw you in prison!’

I got up and left that not-so-famous publishing house, staggering dejectedly down the street and later staggering dejectedly through every moment of the ensuing years.

I once hoped that my son might take up literature and fulfill my unrealized dreams, but all he was interested in was video games. When he was in middle school my little brother gave him a PlayStation Portable (PSP). Every night he played video games under the covers in bed. Now that he is all grown up and has a job, he doesn’t have to hide anymore and can openly play video games on his phone whenever he wants. My niece, on the other hand, was obsessed with books. My weak literary genes skipped my son and somehow ended up with her. I have always treated my niece like my own daughter, meticulously tutoring her and helping her with her homework, from elementary school all the way through high school. By the time she reached college she no longer needed my help. She began to publish her essays in magazines, followed by a series of short stories. One after another, her stories appeared in print like a flurry of flowers blooming in spring – there was no stopping her.

When her first collection of short stories was published, it was brought out by that famous publishing house. Sun Qiang, the young editor who once told me ‘I’m not a doctor’, was now the head of the house and he personally moderated the discussion at her book launch. Sun Qiang referred to her as ‘Eileen Chang reincarnated’, while the media referred to her as a representative figure in the new wave of ‘attractive women writers’.

That was also when she got pregnant. Out of the blue, she was going to have a child.

She woke up one day in the afternoon and began to suspect that she might be pregnant. Ever since she began her career as a writer, she stopped getting up early and would sleep until noon. After waking up that day, she washed up, brushed her teeth, got dressed and put on her makeup, before telling her parents that it had been two months since her last period and she was going to go to the hospital to check if she was pregnant. With that, she went out the door without bothering to eat anything.

My brother and sister-in-law sat there staring at each other in shock. It took a moment for what she said to sink in. My brother even asked my sister-in-law: ‘What did she just say?’

After thinking about it for a second, my sister-in-law said: ‘She said she was going to check something at the hospital.’

‘Did she say she was going to check if she was pregnant?’ my brother asked.

My sister-in-law nodded. ‘I think that’s what she said . . .’

‘How is that even possible?’ my brother yelled. ‘She’s not even married! Hell, she doesn’t even have a boyfriend!’

‘She may not be married . . .’ my sister-in-law replied, ‘but maybe she does have a boyfriend?’

‘Did she ever mention anything about having a boyfriend to you?’

‘Never.’

‘Me neither.’

My brother called me and the first words out of his mouth were: ‘Do you know if Mianyang has a boyfriend?’

Mianyang, or ‘sheep’, is my niece’s pen name. Once she had gained some degree of celebrity on the literary scene, her parents seemed to have forgotten her real name; instead, they always referred to her as Mianyang.

‘Mianyang has a boyfriend?’ I asked through the phone. ‘What does he do for a living?’

‘We’re actually not sure if she has a boyfriend or not; do you know anything about her having a boyfriend?’ he asked.

‘If you don’t know, how do you expect me to know?’ I replied.

‘There are some things that Mianyang refuses to share with us but tells you.’

Those ‘things’ she shares with me are all related to literature. ‘I don’t know. She never mentioned anything about a boyfriend to me,’ I said.

‘If you don’t even know whether or not she has a boyfriend, how the hell did she end up pregnant?’ he said.

I could hear my sister-in-law: ‘She’s getting it checked out right now, we still don’t know if she is really pregnant.’

‘How is that possible?’ I asked.

My brother started to explain what was happening over the phone, with my sister-in-law repeatedly cutting in. Eventually, my brother grew irritated and barked at his wife: ‘Can you stop interrupting me!’

My sister-in-law instead snatched the phone from my brother and said: ‘She blurted out something about possibly being pregnant and ran off to the hospital!’

‘Maybe she’s in the middle of writing a novel and was just reciting some dialogue from her story without even realizing it?’ I suggested.

‘That’s a possibility,’ said my sister-in-law. ‘Actually, she has been acting a bit strange ever since she became a writer.’

‘Aren’t all writers a bit strange?’ my brother asked.

‘What can I say . . . ?’ I replied. ‘I suppose that sometimes they act normal, and sometimes they act strange.’

‘Then how come you’re always so normal?’ my sister-in-law asked.

‘That’s because my brother isn’t a real writer,’ I could hear my brother explaining to her.

‘Shh, lower your voice,’ my sister-in-law whispered to him.

‘No need to lower your voice,’ I said. ‘I can hear everything, and you’re right, I’m no writer!’

Mianyang came back from the hospital around 4 p.m.; she handed her parents the lab report and told them she was pregnant. Facing their flustered expressions, she casually instructed them that, from that day forward, she would be resting at home to ensure the health of her baby. She would be taking all of her meals in her room and, besides going to the bathroom, would not be leaving her bed until the baby was born. With that, she went into her bedroom, closed the door, and climbed into bed.

My brother and sister-in-law butted heads as they simultaneously looked down to read the result of the pregnancy test – it was indeed positive. My sister-in-law rushed into Mianyang’s bedroom screaming:

‘You’re not even married! How could you possibly be pregnant?’

‘What, you can’t get pregnant unless your married?’

Desperate for help, my sister-in-law turned to my brother, who also began yelling: ‘Since when did you even have a boyfriend? How come you never told us?’

‘You tell me, since when have I ever had a boyfriend?’ Mianyang retorted.

My brother and sister-in-law looked at each other in confusion; it was only after a long pause that my brother finally asked: ‘So you don’t have a boyfriend?’

‘No,’ replied Mianyang.

That sent my sister-in-law into another frantic attack: ‘How could you possibly get pregnant without a boyfriend?’

‘I have a lover,’ replied Mianyang.

My brother and sister-in-law stood there gaping, but Mianyang simply signaled for them to leave her room.

‘Close the door on the way out,’ she told them.

They stood there without moving, still wondering what exactly she meant by the word ‘lover’.

Mianyang began to grow impatient: ‘Hey, I’m trying to rest in order to prevent a miscarriage!’

That night they called me up and asked me to come by their apartment. Since Mianyang became a writer, my brother and sister-in-law had been going everywhere with an expression of pride plastered all over their faces. Now they had a distressed look on their faces, as if they were in need of a good scrub. They couldn’t make head nor tail of the strange words coming out of Mianyang’s mouth. They asked me what the difference was between a boyfriend and a lover.

I didn’t know either, but after thinking about it I had a hunch about what Mianyang meant. I told them that ‘boyfriend’ likely referred to someone unmarried whereas ‘lover’ probably referred to someone already married.

‘What?’ my brother gasped. ‘Don’t tell me that Mianyang is someone’s mistress?’

Tears began to pour down my sister-in-law’s face as she exclaimed: ‘It’s so dreadfully shameful! Just the thought of Mianyang being someone’s mistress, getting knocked up, and even insisting on keeping the baby!’

‘Girls today are different from your generation,’ I said, trying to console her. ‘There seem to be a lot of girls who end up with married men these days.’

Her cries became more audible: ‘If Mianyang gives birth to an illegitimate child, how will we ever be able to face anyone?’

‘This is all your fault!’ my brother snapped at me. ‘Ever since she was little you would buy her those literary books and you encouraged her to become a writer. Well, look at her now, reduced to someone’s mistress!’

‘I did indeed encourage her to become a writer,’ I replied. ‘But I certainly never encouraged her to be anyone’s mistress!’

He raised his voice. ‘Do you think she would have ever ended up a mistress if she wasn’t a writer?’

His ridiculous logic was getting under my skin and I said: ‘Well, you’re the one who ruined my son by giving him that damn PSP! Ever since then he has been addicted to video games and has never had an ounce of professional drive!’

‘I’d much prefer it if things had been reversed. Wouldn’t it have been great if you gave Mianyang a PSP and I helped foster your son’s literary talent?’

Speechless with anger, my sister-in-law spoke for me. She pointed at my brother’s nose, and yelled: ‘What do you know about literature? You think you would know the first thing about how to foster someone’s literary talent?’

My brother remained silent while my sister-in-law pleaded with me: ‘Please try to talk some sense into Mianyang. She always listens to you.’

I turned to my brother but he was avoiding my gaze. I figured, forget it, no sense in being petty with him. I approached the door to Mianyang’s bedroom and, just as I was about to knock, heard her voice talking on the phone to someone and lowered my hand.

I could hear her saying: ‘I’m not coming out to see you. I need to stay home and rest up for the baby . . . don’t worry, I have no intention of breaking up your family . . . I’m keeping the baby. I’ll raise the baby by myself. You don’t need to have anything to do with us . . . I already told you, I’m not going to see you. I need to stay at home resting to ensure I don’t have a miscarriage . . . I’m tired, I need to focus on what’s best for the baby.’

There was a period of silence, and after a while it seemed like Mianyang had hung up.

I gently knocked on the door and heard Mianyang respond: ‘I’m resting, please do not disturb me.’

‘It’s me,’ I whispered.

‘Uncle?’

‘Yes, can I come in?’

‘Uh.’

I opened the door to see Mianyang sitting up in bed with her phone, staring at me. ‘Did they ask you to come?’

I nodded. ‘Are you okay?’

‘I’m doing great,’ she said. ‘I’m pregnant.’

‘I heard.’

I wasn’t quite sure what else to say. My sister-in-law asked me to come over to talk some sense into her, but she never explained what exactly that entailed.

I stood there like an idiot for a while before saying: ‘Well, you’d better get some rest.’

‘Uh.’

As I was gently closing the door to her room on my way out, I noticed her flash me a warm smile. Returning to the living room, my sister-in-law anxiously asked:

‘So, what happened?’

‘What do you mean what happened?’

‘Were you able to talk some sense into her?’

‘What exactly did you want me to say to her? It’s not like you gave me any instructions.’

It was only then that we realized how confused the three of us were by the previous argument. We talked it over and agreed that the best course of action would be to persuade Mianyang to get an abortion so we could all move past this as if nothing ever happened. My brother’s temper was out of control; he kept yelling about wanting to go find the bastard that did this and make him pay. I told him that was a secondary matter we could worry about later. Right now the main thing was to persuade Mianyang to get an abortion. My sister-in-law criticized her husband. ‘All he ever does is lose his temper without coming up with anything practical,’ she said. My brother took a deep gulp, swallowing the flurry of curses he wanted to unleash upon his wife. They asked me to try talking to Mianyang again, but I refused. I told them that we should give Mianyang a few days to think things over. Who knows, perhaps she would come around on her own and go to the hospital to have the abortion.

Mianyang remained in bed for the next week, she described it as part of the regime to prevent a miscarriage. My brother and sister-in-law were only allowed into her bedroom to bring her food, but whenever they heard her phone ring, they would scurry over to the door to eavesdrop. A lot of the calls came from that person Mianyang described as her ‘lover’; he seemed to be insisting that she go out to meet him so they could talk things over, because they repeatedly heard her say:

‘I’m not going out; I need to rest up for the safety of the baby.’

There were several occasions in which my brother and sister-in-law tried to cautiously feel out what they could learn about this man, but Mianyang would just say: ‘I’m not telling you anything about him.’

At one point, Mianyang seemed to lose her patience and said, ‘He’s an old man, okay!’

My sister-in-law responded in horror: ‘An old man?’

‘That’s right, I like older men!’ replied Mianyang.

My brother hit himself in the face, yelling: ‘How could you end up in a relationship with an old man?’

‘Well, he’s not as old as you,’ Mianyang replied.

It was sometime after that I received an unexpected call. It was a Sunday afternoon and I was in the middle of lunch when my phone rang. I heard a deep voice on the other end:

‘This is Sun Qiang.’

‘Who?’ My speech wasn’t clear since I had food in my mouth.

The person on the other line said: ‘I think we have a bad connection, I can’t hear you so well.’

I spat the food out of my mouth. ‘Who is this?’

‘This is Sun Qiang.’

‘Sun Qiang from where?’

The self-introduction I heard coming over the other end of the phone left me reeling. He said that Mianyang told him I had some good story ideas for a novel and he was quite interested. He asked when I might have time to meet so he could hear about my story ideas.

‘I’m free anytime,’ I blurted out.

‘How about right now?’ Sun Qiang asked.

‘Of course.’

‘Okay, I’ll text you an address. See you soon.’

After Sun Qiang hung up, I told my wife how impressed I was with Mianyang. After all those years of supporting her dream to be a writer, she was now doing something to repay my kindness. My wife didn’t understand what I was saying so I told her about the call. That’s when my phone buzzed; Sun Qiang texted the address. I got up and headed out the door. I could hear my wife calling out behind me:

‘Hey, you still haven’t finished your lunch!’

I was fifty years old at the time and literature was like a pool of dead water in my heart. Sun Qiang’s phone call was like someone tossing a grenade into that pool, setting off an explosion of waves. As I walked down the street, my legs seemed to regain the nimble gait I had when I was young. I squeezed onto the bus, my body felt like I was twenty all over again. After transferring three times, I arrived at the teahouse Sun Qiang had directed me to, filled with a passion and excitement I hadn’t felt for decades.

Sun Qiang was already there waiting for me in a private room. I went in and introduced myself. He was somewhat overweight and stood up to shake my hand before asking me to have a seat. I sat down and looked at him; his smile appeared forced.

‘Mianyang tells me you were the one who first opened her eyes to literature,’ he said.

‘I’m not sure I can take credit for that,’ I replied. ‘I just helped her with homework essays and gave her some writing tips.’

He nodded but didn’t say anything else. I was waiting for him to ask about my ideas for a novel but after a while his expression seemed to indicate his mind was elsewhere. Finally, I decided to take the initiative and tell him about my thoughts.

‘I’ve actually got ideas for four different novels. The first one is a work of historical fiction set against the Revolution of 1911, the second one is a Sino-Japanese War novel –’

‘How is Mianyang doing?’ he asked.

I paused for a moment before responding, ‘Not so good . . .’

‘What’s wrong?’

I hesitated, not knowing if I should share her situation with him.

‘What’s going on with Mianyang?’ he prodded.

‘She’s pregnant,’ I whispered. The second I blurted that out I regretted it. I hastily added: ‘No one knows about this besides my brother, my sister-in-law, and my wife – not even my son knows. You’re actually only the fifth person to learn about this, please don’t let there be a sixth.’

‘Rest assured, I won’t let there be a sixth.’ His expression became stern. ‘Who’s the father?’

‘None of us know,’ I said. ‘She won’t tell us.’

He heaved a gentle sigh of relief. Taking a sip of tea he suddenly remembered the reason for our meeting and asked: ‘So how many ideas did you say you had?’

‘Four.’

‘And what’s the first one?’

‘It’s a novel about the Revolution of 1911.’

‘Don’t touch that one.’ He waved his hands. ‘That is an important historical event that requires approval from the higher-ups. It’s too much trouble. What’s the second one?’

‘It’s set against the Sino-Japanese War.’

‘Forget that one too.’ Again he waved his hands in a dismissive gesture. ‘That’s a topic that has been overdone. Do you know what the greatest battle of the Sino-Japanese War was?’

‘The 1937 Battle of Shanghai?’

He shook his head.

I tried again: ‘The Battle of Changsha?’

He shook his head again and offered: ‘It took place in Zhejiang at the site of the Hengdian World Studios.’

Seeing the confused look on my face, he explained, ‘The number of Japanese killed in Hengdian surpassed the current population of Japan today. And what’s your third idea?’

‘The third one is centered around a new idea I’ve been playing with these past few years, but I’m still working on it.’ I started to feel a bit uncertain about the project.

‘What genre?’

‘It’s a realist work,’ I said, ‘about forced evictions.’

For the third time, he waved his hands, explaining: ‘Let me tell you, I’ve got more than a dozen drafts of self-criticism reports I’ve been forced to write for books like that in my desk drawer. Whenever one of our books is criticized by the higher-ups, I pick a draft version of the report that best suits the current project, do some light revisions, and submit it.’

‘If it is so dangerous, why do you bother pushing ahead with the book’s publication?’

‘Because those are the books that make money,’ he said. ‘After all, we are a state-owned publishing house. But the state doesn’t give us one cent of subsidies and we are forced to make a profit on our own. So in order to make money we have to take certain risks.’

‘I understand,’ I said. ‘But since I’m not famous, I don’t think anything I write will make you any money.’

He nodded. ‘You can start by writing something that isn’t so controversial.’

‘My fourth idea should be relatively safe.’

‘What’s that one about?’

‘It’s an old-style story.’

‘From what era?’

‘The late Qing, early Republican era.’

‘Does it feature the Chinese Communist Party?’

‘No.’

‘What about the Nationalist Party?’

‘No.’

‘What’s the story about?’

‘The vicissitudes of life.’

‘That’s something you can write.’

I lifted my cup to take a sip of tea, the first sip I had taken since arriving at the teahouse. Just as I was about to go into more detail about my fourth idea, Sun Qiang brought up Mianyang again.

‘So what is she going to do?’

‘What do you mean?’

‘About her pregnancy?’

‘She wants to keep the baby.’

He lowered his voice. ‘That can’t be allowed.’

I looked at him with surprise. He took another sip of tea before looking up and smiling. Speaking slowly, he explained, ‘Mianyang is just starting to build a name for herself in the literary world. If she were to suddenly have a baby it would cause a scandal and the media would eat it up.’

‘We urged her to get an abortion,’ I nodded. ‘My brother, sister-in-law and I all tried to convince her; we told her it would be best to just move past this as if nothing ever happened.’

‘That’s right,’ he said. ‘You must convince her to get the abortion.’

‘I’m going to go to her apartment this afternoon to try and persuade her to go to the hospital to have it done.’

Looking at his watch, he picked up his phone from the table and put it in his jacket pocket. He said he had to attend a meeting. As he waved the waitress over for the check, I asked him:

‘So should I go ahead with that traditional story?’

‘Yes, get to it.’

After paying the bill, he got up and reminded me: ‘You’ve got to convince Mianyang to have the abortion so all of this can quietly go away . . . like it never even happened.’

Imanaged to get 50,000 characters of that traditional story of mine down before I got hit with writer’s block. My emotions were all over the place and my ideas were stuck; there was no way for me to move my plot forward. Every time I tried to write more, it turned out to be a fruitless endeavor – I felt like I was trapped in a sealed room with no windows. I had no choice but to seek out Mianyang for help; I asked her to take a look at what I had written and provide some feedback. I was hoping for some constructive criticism that might give me the inspiration I needed. I had to find a new path forward for this rather traditional story. Mianyang took this 50,000-character manuscript that had already gone through such an arduous journey to finally get on paper and handed it over to Sun Qiang. He was sitting beside her, and she asked him to take a look at it first.

By this time, Mianyang and Sun Qiang were married and their son was already eighteen months old. They took a hands-off approach to parenting, letting my brother and sister-in-law raise their child.

My brother and sister-in-law became specialists in powdered milk. They knew all about the various imported powdered milk brands. They said that domestic brands of powdered milk weren’t made by adding a bit of melamine to the milk powder, they instead added a little bit of milk powder to the melamine! That’s why they insisted on not letting their grandchild anywhere near Chinese-made powdered milk. They talked about powdered milk with such a sense of purpose in their voices. They had Mianyang and Sun Qiang’s phone numbers saved in their phones and every week they called to check on their friends’ international travel schedules to find out which countries they might be visiting. Based on that, they devised a careful plan for which brands of international powdered milk to ask their friends to bring back for them. They increased the number of powdered milk purchases based on their grandson’s growing appetite, factoring in a 50 percent error ratio because sometimes Mianyang and Sun Qiang’s friends forgot to buy it while others were simply too lazy to shop for powdered milk while traveling abroad.

According to my sister-in-law, this chunky little toddler had consumed powdered milk from twenty-one different countries. My brother proudly added:

‘Our grandson has been raised on United Nations milk!’

By this time, Mianyang had published her first full-length novel. It got great reviews and sold well. A Sinologist was even translating the book into French. This news made my brother and sister-in-law go crazy. They said that in a few years, bookstores in all the countries from which their grandson drank powdered milk would have Mianyang’s books on display. But my brother told me not to share that comment with anyone else.

‘That’s the kind of thing you can only say behind closed doors,’ he said.

Sun Qiang was cleaned out after his divorce; his ex-wife ended up with his apartment and all the money in his bank account. He made a triumphant escape by moving into Mianyang’s apartment rental. They put on a lavish wedding with more than 200 guests. My brother and sister-in-law sat at the head table alongside Sun Qiang’s superiors from work, his parents and his college-age daughter.

As Mianyang’s uncle, I was quite honored to sit with a famous writer whom I had long admired. As soon as that writer learned that I was Mianyang’s uncle, he pointed to my sister-in-law and said:

‘I actually think Sun Qiang would be better off with Mianyang’s mother.’

I looked over at Sun Qiang and my sister-in-law sitting at the head table, and nodded my head out of respect for this
famous writer.

‘In terms of age, they would indeed be a better match.’

Sun Qiang invited a television host to serve as master of ceremonies. Speaking through a microphone, the master of ceremonies invited the bride and groom up to the stage. Sun Qiang and Mianyang, who was eight months pregnant at the time, ascended the stage amid a flurry of applause and laughter. The master of ceremonies then invited Sun Qiang’s college-student daughter up to the stage to ask her what she thought about her father’s decision to go ‘out with the old and in with the new’. Sun Qiang’s daughter giggled as she took the microphone and said how much she wanted to congratulate her father on behalf of her mother, but her mother refused, so she could only speak for herself. She said that when she was little, she always wanted a little brother to play with. Her father promised to give her a little brother, but he never made good on that promise; until now! Looking down at Mianyang’s bulging stomach, she made her own promise: when her little brother grows up and wants to start dating girls, she’ll help hook him up.

As Sun Qiang’s daughter stepped down from the stage amid a flurry of laughter and applause, my wife knit her brow and whispered to me: ‘How could she say such a thing in public?’

The master of ceremonies addressed Sun Qiang: ‘So how does it feel to be getting remarried?’

‘Getting remarried feels like . . . getting remarried,’ replied Sun Qiang.

‘And what do you think of the ceremony?’ asked the master of ceremonies.

‘I initially didn’t want to hold a ceremony,’ said Sun Qiang. ‘I just wanted to get registered so we could legally sleep together! But Mianyang wasn’t having it, so I had no choice but to throw something together!’

The master of ceremonies turned to Mianyang: ‘What was it that made you insist on having a big wedding?’

Mianyang responded: ‘I couldn’t let people think that he had secretly crawled into bed with me; I had to prove to everyone that he crawled into bed with me in the most upright manner! That’s why we are holding this ceremony!’

Not liking what he just heard, Sun Qiang turned to Mianyang: ‘Hey, it was clearly you that crawled into my bed! How come all of a sudden I’m the one crawling into your bed?’

Mianyang seemed to be growing angry. She grilled Sun Qiang: ‘The first time, the very first time . . . did I go after you, or did you go after me?’

Not to be outdone, Sun Qiang asked Mianyang: ‘Well, let me ask you, who was the one calling me all the time to ask me out?’

At this point, Mianyang really did lose her temper. She said: ‘I asked you out to discuss literature, not because I wanted to have sex with you!’

Unable to bear it anymore, my wife leaned over and whispered: ‘How could such cultured people utter such uncultured things?’

Seeing the bride and groom starting to really go after each other, the master of ceremonies interrupted them: ‘I can tell that the crux of the argument here all comes down to what happens in bed, so let me ask you: The first time you did it, was it in Sun Qiang’s bed or Mianyang’s bed?’

Sun Qiang and Mianyang looked at each other but before they could respond, the master of ceremonies flashed a sinister smile and asked: ‘Or was it in a hotel room?’

Sun Qiang and Mianyang both burst out laughing. The master of ceremonies turned to them: ‘So, I guess it wasn’t that he crawled into her bed or she crawled into his bed, they both crawled into someone else’s bed!’

With that, Sun Qiang and Mianyang seemed to be even, but just two months later, Sun Qiang lost the upper hand. I’m not exactly sure how Mianyang tamed him, but from that point forward, whenever the two of them appeared in public at various social events, Sun Qiang would always follow Mianyang around like her assistant. He would walk behind her with an SLR camera dangling from his neck, smiling sheepishly. Whenever Mianyang talked to other people, Sun Qiang would stand off to one side taking photos; when she engaged in conversation with people over dinner, he would squat down on the ground to get a good angle to snap his photos. Sun Qiang would often run into old acquaintances at these events, but after exchanging a few pleasantries, Mianyang would always cut them off with an annoyed: ‘Sun Qiang!’ He would immediately scurry over to snap another photo of her. Mianyang had a thing for taking photos with celebrities, so whenever Sun Qiang caught sight of someone famous, he would immediately direct Mianyang to them and click the shutter. Other times, he would direct the celebrity over to Mianyang to get his shot. It didn’t really matter what these celebrities were famous for – playing basketball, running marathons, writing, singing, dancing, acting, writing online sex diaries, undergoing a sex change – Sun Qiang was sure to always snap a shot.

More than a month after Sun Qiang was given a copy of my 50,000-character manuscript, Mianyang called me. She said they were at a party, but when it was over, they would swing by my apartment. Sun Qiang wanted to talk to me. There was a lot of background noise on their end. I anxiously asked what Sun Qiang thought of my manuscript, but she had already hung up. My wife was watching a drama on TV and asked who called; I told her it was Mianyang. She and Sun Qiang were coming over to discuss my novel. My wife immediately turned off the TV and began straightening up the room. I stood there frozen, riddled with anxiety, not knowing whether or not Sun Qiang would approve of what I had written. As my wife got the apartment in order, she told me to run out and buy some fruit to serve to our guests. I left the apartment in a daze.

Sun Qiang and Mianyang arrived around 10 p.m. Mianyang came in and sat down beside me; leaning back sideways on the sofa, she said she was utterly exhausted. Sun Qiang sat across from me, his SLR camera still dangling from his neck. He must have still been wearing the camera from the party they just returned from; I knew he had no intention of using it to take any pictures of us. My wife smiled affably as she poured them tea and served them fruit. I realized that the moment had come that would decide whether or not I would be able to continue on with this traditional story I had been writing. I wanted to smile but my face was frozen. Mianyang lazily munched on a banana before declaring she didn’t want anything else; Sun Qiang started with a banana and then began to leisurely eat a bunch of grapes that his wife handed to him.

I could barely sit still. When I saw my wife approaching with a tray of freshly cut watermelon, I was secretly hoping she wouldn’t bring him anything else to eat – I couldn’t wait to hear what he had to say about my novel and more food would only bring more delays. I flashed my wife a look, but misinterpreting what I meant, she handed Sun Qiang a slice of watermelon. Sun Qiang said he was stuffed and placed the slice of watermelon and the uneaten grapes down on the side table before wiping his hands with a napkin. He then removed his lens cap, held up the camera, and said:

‘Mianyang, sit up straight so I can take a picture of you with your uncle.’

Mianyang wrapped her arm around mine and Sun Qiang clicked the shutter. My fifty-two-year-old heart beat like a twenty-year-old. Sun Qiang’s camera was only ever directed at Mianyang and various celebrities, but now it was pointed at her and me. Perhaps there was hope for my old-fashioned story to move forward. That’s when Sun Qiang said to my wife:

‘Auntie, why don’t you come over and join us for a photo too?’

My wife came over and sat down beside me and Sun Qiang snapped another shot. My heart rate reverted back to a fifty-two-year-old; I realized I had been getting my hopes up for nothing.

It was only after Sun Qiang put down his camera that he finally got around to that 50,000-character manuscript. He said that he had carefully read through it twice, but if you counted the sections that he found most fascinating, it would be closer to seven or eight times. As soon as I heard the words ‘found most fascinating’, I could barely believe my ears. However, right after that he added a ‘but’; the ‘but’, as he explained it, referred to the fact that no matter how many times he read it, the entire manuscript felt like it was just an opening section. As soon as I heard that, it was as if I was struck by a sudden revelation. I told Sun Qiang:

‘Those words you just shared are worth more to me than a decade of study! Now I realize why I couldn’t finish it; I had been stuck in the opening. I never realized I hadn’t gotten past the beginning stages of the novel. But if I’m able to move past that section, I’ll be able to continue with the book.’

Sun Qiang flashed me a look of encouragement, saying: ‘That’s right, you need to get past the opening.’

‘Tomorrow, I’ll get past it,’ I replied."

    "text": "Abu Hammam was the best kind of hole in the wall. Low ceilings, dirty linoleum floors, and perfectly cooked mensef, my favorite meal. A chaos of male voices greeted you as you walked in, coming from harried waiters and bronze-dark men in white smocks shouting over fryers and burbling pots, but I never felt uncomfortable eating there alone as a woman. You’d figure out on your own that you had to go upstairs if you wanted a seat, turning the corner on the landing into the quieter, lower-ceilinged room with plastic chairs and tables lined against the dingy walls, a few crooked pictures of the Dome of the Rock and the Kaaba hanging above them. Anything you ordered came with a hot stack of fluffy pita bread, which I never ate but took home for the birds, spreading crumbs around the soil near my olive trees.

When I first heard the restaurant’s name, I thought it meant Father of the Bathroom. Abu, father; hammam, bathroom – the only difference between the last name Hammam and the word for bathroom being a hard and soft H, a detail that was almost indiscernible to my immigrant ears. I only spoke Arabic when I visited Palestine and I’d lose a lot of the language in between visits. Abu Hammam referred, of course, to the family name, perhaps even a distant wing of my own extended family, the Hamamehs, who lived in McMansions in Texas and the outskirts of my village, Jiljilyya. Hamameh, incidentally, sounded equally to my ears like the word for pigeon, a euphemism for penis.

I ate mensef at Abu Hammam once a week, often alone but sometimes with Wadiyeh, who still hadn’t returned the case of DVDs I’d lent her on my previous trip to Palestine. Wadiyeh was an aspiring filmmaker who produced short interviews for an under-watched Ramallah news program. She was twenty-six, drank and smoked too much, and led men on, but I’m pretty sure she was still a virgin. She wore tight jeans and nude-colored heels, and when she leaned in to gossip or remark on a woman’s bad fashion, I could smell the powdery makeup she’d smoothed across her jawline like an airbrushed Lebanese TV presenter. I’d first met Wadiyeh at Beit Aneeseh, and soon we were sharing an argileh without wiping the nozzle, passing it lip to lip, pulling and exhaling minty vaporous smoke in the dimly lit garden of the historic single-story limestone house that served as the bar. At almost every table I saw people sharing the argileh nozzle, one passing it to the next with a cursory wipe.

It was Wadiyeh who’d invited me to the quasi-underground, loosely kept secret that was the monthly queer party for out and less out Palestinians hosted at some apartment, often one near the gouged-out construction site where Salam Fayyad’s people parked their cranes and bulldozers, or a big 1950s-era walk-up at the end of a street of newish, white limestone five-story buildings. I went every month, even though there were always too many white activists and upper-class European NGO workers, foreign queers and queer adjacents who were there for the anecdote, hoping to bed a native before their visa ended. This wasn’t really a problem, since Palestinians liked fucking foreigners just as much; it was easier being with people who wouldn’t be around for more than a few months or a year.

An hour into the party, both of us already drunk, Wadiyeh tried dragging me to some straight white guy’s apartment to drink and have a Monty Python marathon with a small breakaway group. I took her hand off my shoulder and flinched at her beer breath. I slurred that I was here to find someone to actually fuck, not play games with. She stared at me, taking in this breach of our friendship, but said nothing. She was too invested in her social standing to be seen spatting and left with the white guy and his group. I wasn’t sure if I meant what I said or if I just wanted to antagonize her, but when I thought about it, I decided I did mean it.

I scanned the room of frumpy couches, a makeshift dance floor and scruffy, curly-haired men dancing or absorbed in conversation. Almost everyone wore black T-shirts, which bored me, smoked and guffawed and tossed their curly hair, which bored me, and it was impossible to tell who was gay or straight, though everyone gave off straight vibes, which bored me. The Palestinian women all seemed cliquish, but I struck up conversation with a few and they were warm enough, if poised and too well mannered. One of them was supposedly Ghada Karmi’s daughter. She spoke with a very proper British accent and gave off super, super straight vibes. I wasn’t sure what she was doing there. Maybe she was into the novelty. I had my eyes on a woman I learned was from Haifa, with a buzz cut and maroon chandelier earrings and a black PFLP T-shirt, which suggested she would only be into other people who lived and breathed activism, wore black T-shirts and presented less femme than I did, even though I wasn’t that femme. But I was annoyed with myself for being most attracted to a Spaniard, Lucía, whom I’d met once or twice at daytime political rallies I happened upon at the Manara Square. She brought me over a glass of cheap white wine when she noticed mine was empty.

Lucía had mascara-framed hazel eyes and wavy caramel hair, and was wearing a red spaghetti-strap tank top and baggy jeans that hung loosely from her hips. There was a sprig of hair at her belly button. We sat on a cracked leather couch, drinking and sharing spit on her cigarette, when a small group of brawny Palestinian dykes walked in. They wore oversized T-shirts and shorts with high-top sneakers and had their hair bunched into tight buns or tucked under backwards-facing baseball caps. I couldn’t work out who was with whom based on where they sat, and Lucía and I played mix and match trying to work it out. Lucía said she had a long-term, long-distance girlfriend who wouldn’t leave her job in Madrid to join her in Palestine. She said they were ‘mostly open’, but seemed to be stretching the truth, and when I pressed, she admitted that the girlfriend hadn’t fully come around to the idea yet. I didn’t want to get involved in anything complicated, so I made an excuse and called a cab home.

 

At home in bed, I turned the brightness down on my phone and went through my nightly ritual of mindlessly checking the apps. I was surprised to see Rohit on offer again. I’d rejected her once, but through a glitch in the algorithm, she was back on my screen. I swiped through her pics and paused again on the one I’d paused on last time – her posing in a pale pink dress with one hand on the trunk of an olive tree wrapped in white string lights. I pinched my thumb and forefinger on her face like forceps and zoomed in. The name Rohit didn’t fit her. Just as Netanyahu was born Mileikowsky in Philadelphia, Rohit might’ve been a Kristen or Courtney in the suburbs of Detroit. Her name was an obvious attempt at Fertile Crescent indigenization, but it sounded more like an Indian man’s name, not a white girl’s.

Her profile said she was Middle Eastern and liberal, which made me laugh. She was a vegetarian open to either monogamy or non-monogamy. She didn’t have kids but might want them someday. Under the ‘I could probably beat you at’ question, where people typically wrote answers like baking or Call of Duty or movie trivia, Rohit wrote, ‘I could probably just beat you.’

I swiped to the next photo – she was lying on large rocks in full military uniform, her dark blonde hair tossed across the ground, a rifle resting diagonally across her chest. On a whim I swiped right and my screen flashed with the silhouette of a five-pointed star saying we’d matched. I was perplexed. I figured she was the type to swipe left on Palestinians just as I was the type to reject Israelis.

I went back to the photo of her in uniform and noticed she wore a thumb ring and had painted her nails white, which matched the Hebrew letters emblazoned on her black bulletproof vest. The next picture was off-center, Rohit sticking out her pointy tongue next to a crooked fragment of snow-covered trees. I wondered where she was, what country the picture had been taken in. That could have been my opening question, I thought. But I was never going to message her. I blew my nose and tossed the tissue across my bed. I had no interest in meeting her, and yet I took screenshots of most of her pictures. There was something degrading about saving the pictures I enjoyed. I set my phone on the nightstand near my head, where the screenshots might slither into my subconscious while I slept.

 

Ihad nothing to do the next day. I didn’t want to see Wadiyeh and own up to my shitty comment at the party, but I didn’t want to stay home either, so I drove to West Jerusalem to bathe in eye contact with people who hate my kind. To pass by random Rohits on the street and make them avert their gaze. I peered through the glass walls of clothing boutiques populated by Eastern European women with scalded skin, then walked down the street and played my repugnant but titillating game, pulling my mouth into that lipless smile reserved for strangers. I nodded unrequitedly to Israeli men and women who saw my Arab face and turned from it. If I intuited that it was relatively safe, that they wouldn’t lunge at me for a fistful of hair, I’d touch my tongue to the roof of my mouth twice to say ‘Ahlan’, Welcome, but meekly, so they couldn’t be sure if it was meant for them. If I was braver and said it louder, more directly and looking right at them, it’d receive a harsh glare or an epithet muttered to my back, which gave me a little thrill up my spine. The nastier the look, the more guttural their insult, the harder I’d giggle as I walked past them.

‘Don’t Speak’ played on a cafe’s tinny speakers near the park bench where I sat and uncapped my Thermos of arak, ice cubes hurtling forward as I tipped the rim to my lips and swigged the cold cloudy drink. I loosely hummed along to Gwen Stefani, wishing I had the guts to break out in song and bother the people on the street, like the hunched man in my neighborhood in Detroit who walked with a cane, wearing knock-off Oakleys and bulky headphones as he belted the lyrics to hard rock songs only he could hear.

I was starting to get a little buzzed from the arak, savoring the milky anise flavor and gaining the courage to hum louder in the sunlight surrounded by these people who despised me. I raised my voice and searched for someone’s stare to hold, but no one took the bait. They walked off like they were holding in a shit. I rose from the bench and walked back to my car, humming just loud enough to embarrass myself, provoking a few scowls from Israelis. My head swam and I heard the clink of the ice cubes jostling against the metal walls of the Thermos. I rode my nervous energy, singing quietly in Arabic now, but loudly enough to catch the attention of an elderly Orthodox couple with shopping bags sagging from their arms.

‘Lau samaht, atwaslak,’ I belted mockingly, staring at the man’s averted eyes, cracking myself up as I pulled my car door open and slid in, flooded with nerves as I started the engine.

 

My phone vibrated on the glass coffee table and woke me from my nap. I’d dreamt I was picking the cancer out of my mother’s open lungs like hornets from a nest, tossing the scraps to the side as if to a dog. Parched, I reached for the Thermos and regretted it, not prepared for the lukewarm, watered-down arak.

The house was miserably hot. The AC had cut out. I checked the thermostat, groggily jabbing the buttons, prying at the plastic cover until it creaked and snapped open. I replaced the batteries, expecting a hush of cool air, but nothing happened. My mind went to tampering – petty psychological warfare. I suspected they kept tabs on me, recording me from a distance. I felt it. They knew how much money I had, who I emailed and texted, where I went. That’s what they got off on. I went to the kitchen to see if the electricity was on in the rest of the house and didn’t see the green digital time on the stove. The fridge wasn’t humming, and when I plugged my phone in, the icon in the top corner showed that it wasn’t charging. So it was a simple power outage. The electricity would probably be out for hours.

Wadiyeh had texted me. I still didn’t want to see her. I opened all the windows and changed into a tank top and sweat shorts, deciding against pulling the curtains shut, even if it meant the satellite cameras could capture my body. I didn’t think administrative assistants in military uniform were staring at me on a monitor in real time, or an incel soldier was spitting in his hand in an empty control room, just that it was all uploaded onto a hard drive in the basement of some temperature-controlled government facility. An archive of digital videos of me cooking and putzing, going inside to refill my tea and get a snack, fingering my cellphone on the chair out back.

Sitting on the warm, sunlit couch cushions in plain view of the open window, I brought out my poppers and shook the vial to disturb the tiny white pellet within to strengthen the fumes. I uncapped it, held the bottle to my nostril, sniffed deeply and held my breath as I went slightly cross-eyed, braced against the pounding in my chest, strong as a baby’s kicks, my underwater heartbeat thumping in my ears. I lay back and closed my eyes. My temples and cunt throbbed and I felt a surge of sexual power. The blank, blotchy yellow screen of my eyelids gave way to a windowless office and a soldier, and as I pictured crouching before him, fishing out his soft bits and tearing into his scrotum with my teeth like into a tomato, I pleasured myself. I imagined feeling flooded in the hot blood and coiled noodles spilling from his groin, the ripped skin in my teeth, the smack of a bullet entering my forehead, blotting out my third eye, and I pleasured myself. Soldiers zipping my corpse in a body bag, ditching me in some overgrown valley, and I astonished myself, still hectically rubbing, not undeterred but fueled by the vile montage. Sometimes it got so bad, the images so hideous and demonic, a rushing cascade of intrusive thoughts I couldn’t stop or control, I had to pinch my clit hard to shut it up.

Usually, though, I could bear it, like I did now, slumped into the couch cushion with a leg on the coffee table. I shook the bottle and took another hit. I resisted the ghastliest of the images and toyed with the most seductively extreme, going past the line, but not so far past that I scared myself in a lingering way. My breathing became frenetic as I raised my hips off the couch and held myself there, tensed euphorically. Afterward, I fell back and immediately began coughing, heaving, honking, stomach-clenching coughs of disgust. I swore I’d throw out the poppers and be done with them, but they were just expensive enough that I didn’t want to be wasteful. And anyway, I’d tried that before.

The heat of the sunlight and the lack of AC felt suffocating. I wanted to crawl out of my skin. I texted Wadiyeh and told her to meet me at Beit Aneeseh, then I sent Lucía the same message. I washed my face and held it close to the mirror, staring at the peach fuzz above my lips. I licked my fingers and smoothed my eyebrows, picked a fluff of lint from my belly button, wrapped my hair in a cinnamon turban, and dropped the poppers in my purse in case we ended up dancing.

At Beit Aneeseh, thorny bushes with sparse pink roses lined one side of the perimeter wall near the table where Wadiyeh sat in a rattan chair waving to me. There were tables full of smug, laugh-happy Europeans. By now I’d made acquaintances with a few regulars at the bar, worldly Arabs born there but who’d traveled or studied outside and spoke smooth, arrogant English. There was occasionally an air of a superiority complex in the subdued but condescending way they talked to waitstaff or in happenstance bar conversation with working-class shebab. But most were so well adjusted and sweet it made me uncomfortable to be around them, so I sought refuge with the garish, vacuous, ridiculous Wadiyeh, who carried herself like a Ramallah socialite.

Sitting alone sipping argileh, an apple ornamenting the glowing wafer of coal, her perfume smelled like makeup, or her makeup was perfumed, I wasn’t sure, but either way she was wearing too much of it. The smell mingled unpleasantly with the cloud of apple tobacco funneling out of her nostrils. I leaned over to kiss her cheeks and plopped down on the rattan chair beside her. There were days I liked how she smelled, powdery and synthetically floral, but tonight she smelled sweet and oily like a cadaver, like my father’s puffy hands and face smelled when I leaned over the glossy wood casket to kiss him. Some days she wore hijab, but mostly she didn’t. Tonight she didn’t. It depended on where we were going, if it matched a certain outfit or if it would make her fieldwork as an arts and culture journalist easier. I liked that about her, at least, her flippant stance on wearing hijab. More often than not she used a loose, stylized scarf over her hair as an excuse to wear tighter jeans and heels. I found this obnoxious and told her so. She clapped back that I dressed like I didn’t care.

On one of our first nights out together she said I looked like a man, criticizing my lack of eyeshadow or lipstick and how my few pieces of jewelry were too reserved. Then I showed her the Snapchat filter that masculinized her face. She raised the phone eye level and posed as the image on her screen thickened her brow and added a digital beard along her jawline, and she cackled when she saw herself on the phone screen – a stabbing, throaty laugh. I said she looked like a himbo but she didn’t hear or didn’t get the joke, swiveling her head to try to outmaneuver the lush black facial hair that clung digitally to her face.

Lucía would be meeting us soon. A couple tables over, three shebab were chain-smoking and drinking amber bottles of Taybeh, their black hair gelled and crispy. One of them had a reddish-brown face and shyness in his yellowed eyes. He probably labored outside, I thought, unlike his olive-skinned friends who looked like salesmen or bank clerks in chunky silver watches, pointy leather shoes and boxy untucked dress shirts with starched collars. Another sheb at their table smiled at us, raised his beer bottle and nodded, and I told Wadiyeh we should suggest joining tables. She hesitated, but I could tell they were her type and she wanted to flirt.

‘Come on,’ I said, opening Snapchat, ‘we can make them women.’

‘I don’t wanna embarrass them,’ Wadiyeh laughed.

‘They’re not Wahhābī,’ I said. ‘They can take a joke.’

‘I’m not even buzzed yet.’

She opened her phone camera to check her lipstick and swigged her beer, steeling herself. It was absurd – no matter how well the night went, how charming or persuasive the men, I knew Wadiyeh wouldn’t go home with any of them. She was too prudish to even give them her number.

I nodded in their direction. ‘Bidkum tokudu ma’ana?’

They lifted their beers and cigarette packs and dragged their table over so it touched ours. Wadiyeh pointed at each of their chests to get their names, reducing the grown men to giggling schoolboys waiting their turn. She talked too much like always, introducing me as ‘sahebti Americaniyeh’. I would have rolled my eyes, but I didn’t want to undermine her. Now that they were closer, I saw that the red-faced one, Majid, wore a wedding ring. He was handsome and had full lips and a part in his gelled hair.

Years of coming to Palestine had taught me that most villages had an unofficial troubadour, a young man everyone would nominate, if they could, to audition for Arab Idol to become the next Mohammed Assaf. Majid’s friends did this now, cajoling him to impress us with his gift. The red deepened through the brown as he smiled nervously and declined. But when Wadiyeh rested her hand on his forearm and begged in a moany, childish tone, ‘Bidna nismaa sotak al-hilo,’ he cleared his throat and looked at the other tables as if to gauge how quiet or loud he should be. His friends stared at him with the anticipation of watching their favorite striker line up to take a penalty shot. He tilted his chin and sang a sad song, stretching the vowels with yearning vibrato. His voice was cottony and achingly gentle. He closed his eyes through some of it, then opened them and gazed absently at the sky. He held eye contact with me for a few seconds before looking around at the others. I wondered if he made his wife wet by singing to the TV with a cigarette dangling from his fleshy lower lip, if he whispered a song after coming another kid into her on a Wednesday, stuffed zucchini jostling around their bellies like the soggy clothes in the dryer.

After a round of fawning applause that included several of the surrounding tables, we settled back into conversation and a few minutes later, Wadiyeh opened Snapchat, flipped the camera and pointed it at me, showing the shebab my glitchy beard and thick caricaturesque eyebrows. They burst into guffaws, spurting smoke, the scent of apple and beer in the cool air. I thought I looked hot, honestly, if too metrosexual. We showed them what they’d look like as women, eyelashes like centipede legs. They ducked out of the frame, and Wadiyeh chased them with the front-facing camera, capturing their happy female faces, computerized hair draping over blushing cheekbones, lips full and red. I was irritated with her for monopolizing the male sheb-himbos’ attention, and irritated with Majid for falling for it.

I ordered olives for the table. They came in a white saucer, swimming in brine, slippery and bruise-purple. I hogged the plate and ate most of them, dropping the pits into Wadiyeh’s empty beer bottle. I picked up one of Majid’s olive pits that he’d left sitting on the table next to his last beer and popped it in my mouth, turning it on my tongue like a Werther’s.

Lucía arrived, Lucía the lesbian’s lesbian in torn jeans and a slouchy yellow tank top, a single skinny dreadlock on one side of her caramel-colored hair. She made a show of kissing everyone three times, even the shebab she’d just met, from cheek to cheek to cheek. A soft-spoken waiter came over and she ordered a Riesling and a fresh argileh for the table. I was glad because now we would all pass the nozzle around and share each other’s spit. Wadiyeh and the shebab flirtatiously debated what flavor of tobacco to order, but they settled on tufahtayn, the usual.

I slightly resented Lucía’s ease with new people. She lounged back in her chair and spoke rapidly to one of the men and was nodding and laughing with him in under a minute. She even spoke Arabic more fluently than me, the bitch. I could picture her living her whole life in Palestine, where I was sure that even if I could, I probably wouldn’t. I was here on a renewable three-month tourist visa, her work visa extended a year at a time. Still, I wished she’d break up with her girlfriend in Spain so I could start sleeping with her. Maybe I’d sleep with her anyway.

Lucía waved over a friend she recognized from across the bar, a drunk, pudgy Egyptian in a frumpy leather jacket. As he made his way to us, zigzagging widely around tables, she told us that they’d been in Tahrir Square together during the beginning of the so-called Arab Spring. She stood to greet him but he staggered past her and leaned over the table, jostling it and spilling the olive brine as he declared, in heavily accented English and without so much as a hello, ‘We Egyptians are more Palestinian than you Palestinians. You can drink to forget but I can’t.’

Wadiyeh sucked in air. No one spoke.

‘Maalek, ya zalameh?’ one of the sheb finally shouted, What’s wrong with you?, as Majid grabbed his beer bottle menacingly. Lucía was panicking. I could see it in her eyes. She grabbed her drunk friend by his leather jacket and pulled him away as he smirked and muttered with wet lips.

Wadiyeh and I glanced at each other. She looked grim. I tried thinking of something to say to lighten the mood, anything to steer us away from the possibility of talking politics. I almost asked Majid for another song. Then the waiter came over and set Lucía’s wine glass in front of her empty chair, and a minute later returned with the apple argileh, handing me the nozzle. He flipped the blazing coal with silver tongs and said, ‘Fadhul.’

Wadiyeh was the only one who thanked him.

I hesitated, then held the plastic to my lips and inhaled, pulling in sweet vapor. The water in the base of the argileh burbled obscenely against the silence.

Over the course of six months my hands grew not only dexterous but automatic and steely. Shielded with calluses, my fingertips stopped aching from pinching the sharp edges of the tiny elements through the thin latex gloves. The unit director Mr Wang no longer scolded me for lagging behind the conveyor belt, or exceeding the standard failure rate, which meant that my mind had the leisure to roam. While I worked, I calculated roughly how many elements I plugged during a standard working day, which consisted of twelve hours including lunch and supper breaks. The clock was broad and round on the wall, visible from every corner of the workshop like a moon, and now and again I glimpsed at it. I varied the unit time from five minutes to ten minutes, to half an hour, and multiplied the number of elements plugged accordingly. I worked out that on a good day I could plug 11, 240 elements.

Later, I would share the mathematics with my roommates and they would laugh and call me ‘philosopher Lili’. I continued to calculate the numbers by week – we worked six days a week – then by month, year, and eventually for my whole working life. In the city, women retired at fifty-five years old, but it was rumored that the age was prone to extending. I tried to work out how many elements I would have plugged if I retired at sixty, and soon I was fatigued before a simple subtraction.

I was sixteen. It felt like an eternity. (Plugging.)

 

One day my underpants disappeared. They had been washed clean, dried under the sun, and folded in a neat pile in my tin cabinet. Four of us shared one room, and we each had a table with a chair, a tin cabinet, and above these objects there was a single bed reached by a ladder. It wasn’t the first time that my underpants had gone missing. Once, a pair had gone before I could fetch them back from the balcony, leaving a naked hanger dangling in the air. I asked whether anyone had seen my underpants. The first time no one answered. The second, Nana asked what I meant, then she chuckled and said, ‘What kind of girl has as many underpants as you do anyway?’

I didn’t respond immediately. But a few days later, during an on-bed talk after the lights were turned off, I diverted the conversation towards underpants with another roommate Jiaojiao. Jiaojiao was pretty and exquisite like an urban girl. She had skincare products lined up on her table, which she told us were gifts from the guy she was dating. The two of us agreed that urban girls had at least half a dozen pairs of underpants instead of just a couple, and that they changed and washed them every day instead of once a week. This was the normal, civilized and hygienic way. Nana kept silent in the dark.

The third time my underpants went missing I didn’t mention it. Instead, I looked around when my roommates were using the bathroom. Soon I found one pair under Nana’s rumpled quilt and another under her bed. Neither were the ones that had gone missing lately, but I did find the pair that had disappeared from the hanger on the balcony. They were dirty: the vaginal discharge had dried up and formed a solid layer. I soaked them in tap water and scraped them clean with my fingernail. Later, when they had dried, I moved all my underpants beneath my pillow.

When I was in the village with my granny, she used to teach me that if I went to work in the city one day, I should do as the locals do. ‘Don’t be such a rural girl – dazzled by city fancies, full of blind ambitions, and ignorant of the rules.’ It turned out not everyone had a granny.

 

Little Mei, who worked on my left side on the assembly line, was caught in a mire. She was too young, only fourteen years old, though her ID said sixteen, which is what enabled her to work. She was small and bound her thin, yellowing hair in a shapeless ponytail; her two freckled cheeks reddened unevenly by the biting winds of her village, like apple flesh after hours of exposure to the air. People are treated based on how their faces look. To some faces, everyone speaks with manners; whereas other faces invite a punch. Jiaojiao applied layer after layer to her face every day, wearing fine pores as her armor. As for Little Mei, even dogs would bark more fiercely when she passed by. Little Mei’s roommates were three women in their forties and fifties and they were known as the Aunt Gang. There were other middle-aged workers in the electronics plant, but unlike the Aunt Gang they all slept in their own homes rather than in the dorms. Sister Ya who worked on my right side, for instance, took the shuttles between the industrial park and downtown Chongqing every day. The Aunt Gang, however, remained in the dorm for various reasons. During lunchtime, in front of everyone, they asked loudly why Little Mei smelled so stinky, and why she whined at night, keeping them awake. When Little Mei tried to defend herself, the three tongues swung like swords, blocking Mei’s voice. When Mr Wang passed by, they barked especially eagerly, as if they were his loyal dogs guarding the perimeter of our unit. Little Mei fixed her rheumy eyes on her rice until the women had finished criticizing her and moved away.

‘Rotten pussies!’ Sister Ya cursed in a low voice across the lunch table. ‘What good can they get from this?’

‘I clean the dorm and handwash their clothes, but they’re still like this,’ Little Mei murmured.

‘Why do you wash their clothes?’ Ya frowned. ‘Girl, don’t you know how to say “no”?’

Little Mei shook her head in tears. ‘I don’t dare. The other day they lit a cigarette, got the dorm smoky, and reported me for smoking indoors. The dorm keeper found half a carton from my cabinet, which the aunts must have put there while I wasn’t looking. The dorm keeper warned me to listen to them, otherwise she will report it upwards and get me fired!’

‘Dorm keeper Wu? That bitch is their friend!’ I explained to Little Mei. ‘She’s no superior, she’s not even an administrator. Let them report it. They have their testimony and you have yours. We’ll see who’ll get fired eventually!’

Little Mei wrinkled her forlorn face in silence.

People say wise men mind their own businesses. But I saw a chance coming up for Little Mei when Jiaojiao resigned. Jiaojiao walked out of the dorm gloriously the day her fiancé drove a car to fetch her. He was a Chongqing local and owned an apartment; they were to get married. So, we had a vacant bed in our dorm. I immediately urged Little Mei to visit the administration office and apply for a move. At first, she shivered at the thought of troubling the administration. I told her, ‘If you’d rather live this way, then I have nothing to say.’ So, Little Mei braved the office. I asked Sister Ya to come and stand behind Little Mei with me. The office lady glanced at our faces and enabled the transfer with a few clicks on the computer.

I had my own motive. Nana and Ah Hong soldered printed circuit boards in the same unit; without Jiaojiao, I ran short of an ally in the dorm. Ah Hong was fine, but Nana could be mean. My granny said you should load the gun when the wolf sniffs around your hedges instead of waiting for it to snarl at your door. I wanted to be ready in case the covert rivalry over my underpants escalated into an open war in the dorm.

 

My underpants disappeared again, from right under my pillow. My anger was like a leaking balloon that rose halfway into the air before trembling reluctantly to the floor. I flopped on the bed and pondered whether to get a lock for the tin cabinet. No one locked their cabinets and if I did, it would seem as though I judged the others as potential thieves; this would be an open announcement of mistrust and Nana would definitely have something to say.

I thought of leaving. How could I make it at this low-end post with these low-end people? I chewed the word low-end bitterly, though it stabbed at my heart, too. Because I was one of them. The old saying goes, ‘People climb up and water flows down.’ If I was better than Nana, I should get up and walk out of the plant; I should push myself to a higher place where Nana could never imagine touching a corner of my clothes. But I was too tired. Granny held a different philosophy, though. She said the moon shines on high mountains and deep valleys alike. ‘You revel in your golden house, and I take care of my thatched hut.’ Instead of climbing up, she wanted me to eat well, stay warm and happy, and remember that the moon always shone on me, even when I felt like I was stuck in the gutter.

Thinking of Granny, I recovered some strength. I rummaged through Nana’s bed and found all the previously missing underpants, used and unwashed, except for one pair which I assumed she must be wearing. I washed them clean, dried them under the sun, and folded them. Then, I tidied them away under my cotton-padded mattress, in the middle of the bed, so that they were difficult to reach from every edge. On the mattress, there was a sheet, a cotton quilt, a blanket and sometimes, my clothes. I sat on top of these for a while; then I pulled a pair of underpants out and placed them beside Nana’s pillow.

 

Sometimes, while plugging, I thought about the office lady clicking the mouse before the bulky monitor. My counterfeit Nokia helped to find some ‘help wanted’ ads at local manufacturing plants, listing the requirements for similar jobs. The office lady was probably just a polytechnic school graduate – better than me, a middle school graduate – but far from a fairy. I browsed through the computer-related professions, and soon ads popped up promoting courses to learn Microsoft Office, Photoshop, and Programming, flexibly scheduled, with no need of full-time enrollment. ‘Be careful!’ I reminded myself. There were so many scams. But on second thought, I found no reason to worry, because I didn’t even have any money to be cheated of.

Six months earlier, my mother escorted me here by bus. The bus zigzagged along the mountain roads for three hours. The landscape was like a crumpled sheet, with ridges and gorges lying densely, and my poor home village rapidly slid to the middle of the wrinkles like a pea. When we arrived at the factory my mother shepherded me through the health checkups, signing the contract, settling me down in the dorm, and opening a bank account. After registering my bank card for the coming salaries in the accounting office, my mother gripped the card in her hand. As we stepped out of the office, I realized that she intended to keep the card and I reminded her, ‘I think the meals are not for free in the park. They are only subsidized.’

So we headed back to the office and confirmed it with the accountant. The accountant was a middle-aged woman with a dull bulbous face and wooly curly hair whose silver was eroding the dyed brown from the roots. She hollered, ‘Of course she needs to pay for the meals! She needs also to buy toilet paper, soap, and other necessities!’ My mother told me that she would leave her bank card with me instead. ‘I will deposit some expenses for you monthly.’

The accountant clamored, ‘We only bind the Staff ID with the employee’s bank card. What’s the use of your card in the park?’ She brandished a transparent plastic ruler at my mother’s fist, where my bank card was hidden beneath her fingers. ‘Give it to your daughter! Do you want her to run away with a man for a meal?’

My mother cursed the accountant throughout the walk to the bus transit, saying that her man must have died or that she must be a spinster. Normal women didn’t have such wicked tongues. I kept silent; I sensed that the accountant was helping me. My granny said, there are good people and bad people, good in a thousand ways and bad in a thousand ways. The first half told me to expect both; the second half told me not to make reckless judgments like my mom did.

Before my mother boarded the bus, she stressed several times that each month I should transfer two thirds of my salary back home. She called me on my salary days, only on the salary days.

 

Little Mei and I chatted on the balcony. She was brought up by her granny, too, when her parents were jobbing in the cities like mine. The cities didn’t offer enough space for their kids, though our brothers were always with our parents and attended urban schools. We only ever saw them during holidays.

‘Once, my brother beat me, but afterwards my parents scolded me instead, so I walked to my granny’s hut. I walked into her yard and realized that she had passed away years ago. My parents called me dumb for a reason,’ Little Mei sighed.

I wanted to say that she was lucky to have a hut to visit at all. Last year, when my granny was gone, the homestead was taken by my uncle. The rammed-earth house was torn down, as well as the bamboo hedges covered with pumpkin vines, handmade and planted by Granny and me together. Now, a large two-story brick house stood there, coated in ugly grey concrete, and full of racket from his kids. I never wanted to get too close.

I visited my granny’s grave on the mountain instead. Some villagers chopped down the woods in the area to grow fruits and herbs but failed to manage the land properly. In the damp summer, shrubs such as honeysuckle, privet and persimmon grew high and messy. I stumbled back and forth, but couldn’t find my granny’s grave, sweat dripping down my sleeves and pants. I needed to tell Granny that I couldn’t attend school anymore and I was leaving for Chongqing. But I couldn’t find her. I was pissed off, not sure whether at myself or everyone in this village. For hours I was trapped like a bee in a lampshade. The words that I had prepared collapsed beneath my skin and seeped out as bitter liquid, drenching me from the inside out. I wanted to smash my head against a wall and die. But there was no wall on the mountain, not even an arbor that could offer a solid trunk. There were only shrubs, which shrank back at my collision and tortured me with endless pricks and scratches.

Nana came onto the balcony to hang up her washed clothes. She glanced at us and said deviously, ‘You sisters really have a lot to talk about!’

Little Mei replied, ‘Join us, please, Sister Na! Cool breezes today.’

Nana was clearly overwhelmed and her words slid off her tongue reflexively. ‘No. I have another thing to do. Next time.’ She repeated ‘next time’ before disappearing into the door.

Little Mei and I looked at each other quietly for a few seconds until we giggled together.

The success at the office encouraged Little Mei and her demeanor shifted as she started to understand how the world worked. I also noticed that Little Mei called the others ‘Sister Na’, ‘Sister Hong’, and so forth, but instead of ‘Sister Li’, she just called me ‘Sister’.

 

On Sundays, we crowded into the shuttle to the metropolis of downtown Chongqing. The municipality of Chongqing, directly under the central government, was the size of a province. On paper, I was from Chongqing, too, but if I dared to say so, people would laugh till their teeth loosened. Back home, we squeezed our lives into the crevices of the mountains, while here mountains gave way to human will. Concrete structures climbed and covered the high slopes like creeping vines. Above one ground level, there was another, like the seven-layered wedding cake I once saw a picture of online. Shops, houses, cafes, cars, and people decorated the broad hardened roads layer by layer like cream flowers. The heart of the city was cut into three pieces by the Yangtze River and Jialing River. Vapor rose aggressively from the water, steamed the ferries, bridges, and cables tangled between the banks, and wafted away.

The swarms of people and the steel-reinforced buildings gave us a sense of security. We stopped worrying about landslides or crop failures; rice was always piled up in the market. But somehow, we were still on the run. Grasping each other’s wrists, we wound through the crowds in a chain. As we climbed the stairs, the heads in front turned back every minute or so to check on the heads behind, as if the wrists in our hands could be stolen and replaced with an imposter’s.

We slowed down in an old downtown neighborhood. It was poorly polished and less crowded. Moss and steps had worn down the stone stairs which were now fractured and slippery. Some residences were the old style five-floor buildings and some were even older bungalows. Walls were darkened and peeling, pipes rusted, and people were old. A white-haired granny carried a basket of vegetables up the stairs. With every step, her millstone-shaped butt skewed to the right. But she was still faster than us. My granny was a good climber, too, and walked on the treacherous mountain tracks as if they were hardened roads. She didn’t look sporty, because it was never a sport for her. Sparrows jump on the ground, elephants drink through their trunks, and grannies walk, unglamorous but effective, until their death bed. Meanwhile I plug; not a sport to me, either.

A man approached us. He was short and fleshy, in a black polo shirt, face shaven, and speaking in a strange, accented Mandarin. Ah Hong, first in our row, kept asking What? What?

‘I’m illiterate. I can’t read. Could you read that for me? Just read that for me? Will you? Will you? Will you?’ The man gesticulated in a direction. He was anxious and helpless but he was also confident and eloquent; he spoke like a man.

He could have given us a piece of paper to read but instead he led us to an apartment building. I don’t know why we followed him. I didn’t question it because nobody else showed any trace of doubt. It had been programmed into our instincts that when a man spoke to us like this we would listen and nod and follow him. He led us inside a staircase where crummy ads were collaged onto the walls. As we climbed the man pointed to them and we answered like students called upon in a classroom.

‘Pipe repair.’ That was Ah Hong, nervous about the precision of her pronunciation.

‘Locksmith.’ That was Nana, voicing authoritatively.

‘Photographing.’ That was me snatching an easier one.

‘Funeral supplies.’ Me again. Little Mei had clammed up and clung to me tightly since the man appeared.

The man shook his head and waved his arm, urging us to follow. We crowded up along the narrow steps, besieged inside the old stony construction. On the second floor, he didn’t bother to stop for us to read the collages. ‘It’s higher up,’ he grunted vaguely. ‘They always put it higher up.’ I asked what exactly he was looking for but even though he answered seriously we didn’t understand his reply. It didn’t make sense, and our inability to work out what he wanted felt like our fault.

‘We don’t read much,’ Nana said. ‘I’m afraid we can’t be that helpful.’

‘It’s okay. Don’t worry,’ said the man, forgiving our ignorance. ‘Come upstairs.’

Nana looked back at me as we reached the third floor and her eyes admitted that she was as suspicious as me. Of course she was. As the thief of my underpants, she was far from naïve. And, in turn, I piled my underpants under the mattress and played dorm politics against her. We were quite the pair. When our eyes met, the spell broke. Without a word, I grasped Little Mei’s hand and Nana grabbed Ah Hong, and we rushed downstairs. Little Mei and Ah Hong couldn’t be more willing to go and the four of us kept running, out of the apartment building, down the stone stairs, and all the way to the bank of the Jialing River.

‘That was horrifying,’ cried Little Mei, her mottled face drenched with sweat.

‘It was’, said Ah Hong, although she was still confused. ‘Who the hell was he?’

‘Shit! Can’t you see it? He was going to kidnap and traffic us!’ Nana claimed.

‘But what if he was really just illiterate and needed help?’ Ah Hong reasoned. ‘There are four of us and only one of him.’

‘He’s a man,’ Little Mei pointed out.

‘Is one man enough to doom us all?’

‘There were more men waiting upstairs! Come on! It’s obvious!’ Nana complained.

‘Maybe something was wrong with his head?’ Little Mei guessed.

‘Did any of you look back on the way out?’ I asked.

They hadn’t. So, I said, ‘I did. He was staring at us over the rails, and you know, his eyes were kind of angry and cold, like a snake seeing its prey running away.’

My words put an end to the fuss, though Nana indicated with her eyes that she wouldn’t believe a word from me. We huddled in the shade on the river bank for an hour or two, yawning and chatting idly. After all the running, smells rose from our bodies with the heat. Ah Hong smelled like a rose that had dried up for a hundred years, perhaps due to her fake-brand shampoo; Nana gave out a creamy smell which I believed was her virginal discharge; Little Mei smelled like wet soil after a summer rain, and I could never wash away the rubber odor from my hands. But these smells were all familiar and calmed us down. We lingered into the evening.

When the neon lights were turned on and dyed the river orange, we almost forgot the brief stairwell episode and recovered our glee. We joined the crowd on the sidewalk and moved from one storefront to another, enjoying the tender breeze and the street music. In front of a shopping mall, Nana spotted a boba tea shop inside, the perfect place for us to spend a few bucks.

When we came to the counter, we were surprised to see a familiar exquisite face. Jiaojiao wore a pink checkered apron with the teashop logo printed on the chest. She was attaching an order sticker onto a paper cup for a customer. Surprise and embarrassment flashed in her eyes for a moment, but soon she adjusted her mood and beamed.

‘We thought you got married,’ Nana said.

‘I’m engaged,’ Jiaojiao replied. ‘But even if I were married, I would still work.’

We agreed, of course, and Jiaojiao proposed that the drinks be on her. We declined firmly and she didn’t insist.

As we sat down around a table, Ah Hong taunted, ‘I didn’t imagine this when she left like a queen.’

‘I envy her.’ Little Mei was grateful for Jiaojiao’s leaving. ‘She works in the splendid center of the world. She can see the sun set every day.’

Nana, surprisingly, didn’t say a mean word about Jiaojiao. She looked up at the counter, where Jiaojiao was moving around among paper cups, Lee Lok Pillows, tanks of boba, and tea boxes; even the yellow lamplight around her seemed sweetened.

‘Do you think she can make as much?’ I asked.

Nana glanced at me and shook her head. ‘But it’s easier work.’

‘Sure, it is,’ Ah Hong said. ‘My arm was literally unmovable after the first day holding the soldering gun for ten hours.’

‘Her heels get sore, though,’ I said. ‘They won’t make a shift shorter than six hours.’

We puffed and sipped our tea quietly.

‘Sister,’ Little Mei whispered, holding the transparent plastic cup with both hands. ‘This is not like the colorful ones I used to drink in my town.’

‘The colorful ones use artificial chemicals and are not healthy,’ I whispered back. ‘This brown is the natural color of authentic milk tea.’

She sighed in satisfaction and sucked at the straw; then, she sighed again, ‘Sister, I wish my granny could taste it. I wish she could see this.’

I followed her eyes towards the giant glass window. Behind it, the city center shone like a grand firework. ‘Me too,’ I murmured. Then, I saw the reflection of Jiaojiao on the glass, spinning behind the counter.

‘Have you ever thought of lessening the money you send back home, Mei?’

‘Are we allowed to?’ She asked calmly.

‘We are on our own feet,’ I said. ‘Good or bad, we are on our own feet now.’

 

After the tea, Nana, Ah Hong, and I strolled into the shopping mall while Little Mei waited for us at the tea shop. In the skincare section, I thought of Jiaojiao and her rows of skincare products, and then I thought of Little Mei. I picked up a bottle of face cream from a mass-market brand. It would help Mei’s rotten-apple face. I imagined handing it to her; I imagined modelling my granny’s wisdom and telling her that, ‘In the city, no one needs to know where we have climbed up from.’

Carrying the face cream through rows of shelves, I spotted Nana standing before a stall with a poster promoting ‘discounted underpants’. She picked up a package and then dropped it; then she picked up two and examined them back and forth. Finally, I saw her hesitantly hold a package against her chest, before heading to the cashier. I breathed deeply. Thank goodness. Thank Granny. Mercy was on my underpants.

    "text": "Ican’t make heads or tails of it, the goat on the corner of Union and Metropolitan. Of course, I’ve seen stranger things, living in this city: the Chabad men dragging a straw effigy down Myrtle Avenue cursing each other in Yiddish, the woman selling infant-sized dolls made out of her own human hair, the apartment fire at the popular Chelsea orgy – flames licking up the side of the building like the cheap wig of some messy god. But this goat, mottled gray coat with a short white beard, is just standing on the corner chewing on some long grasses that appear to materialize in his mouth as he chews. It’s 7 a.m. and commuters walk past without noticing. A group of boys run by on their way to school, trailing their baseball gloves behind them like giant leather hands. The elder waitress in ancient caked-on makeup smokes outside the terrible twenty-four-hour diner, looking deep into the distance, not about to be bothered by goats.

I pause only a moment; the twin slits of its pupils reflect back traffic, pedestrian and automobile alike, all seemingly uninterrupted by the wildlife. And though I can’t be sure, it almost seems as if people are passing straight through its still body. All I’ve ever wanted is to belong somewhere, and all I can ever feel is how out of place I likely appear. So, in this spirit I too walk past the goat as if it were a normal part of the landscape; I too accept what’s in front of me and what is to come as I head down the subway steps. I leave behind the borough, and the animal, and that older man’s fancy apartment, wearing his stolen French shirt after abandoning my own, pit- and popper-stained on his bathroom floor, knowing full well I’ll never have to see any of this ever again.

 

Weekends we drink forties on the flatbed of Edwin’s stepdad’s blue pickup. Behind the 7/11 after dark, anything is possible. The we’s always me, Edwin, and whatever collection of shitheads decide to gather that particular evening. I say shitheads but mean only boys. I say boys and mean some kind of mollusk, hard-shelled with tender meat inside. We get the beer with Edwin’s fake – says he’s from Iowa, twenty-nine, and his newly grown mustache offers a little wink. I use the money from my allowance, even though he’s got more, and we sit and drink until the police are called or we get bored.

These nights are endless, years blended into a stretch of asphalt, into Olde English bottles smashed into showers of light, into shadowboxing as our shadows cast huge kissing shapes below the parking lot’s uniform sodium streetlamps. And Edwin smirks through all this like nothing could possibly touch him unless he invites it. Timid grin, fat lower lip, thick eyebrows below his midnight-blue Yankees cap. At night in bed, when there is only my dark ceiling looking down at me, his face floats there, taking up the whole faux stucco surface, unnaturally big, eyes like two dimming headlights, his mouth a car door opening as if to say: Get in, queer, doesn’t matter where we’re going, I’m driving.

 

My final year coincides with the Clarion dung beetle being wiped clean off the surface of the earth. The last beetle was a spinster living beneath a stone bench in Calvary Cemetery you can see for a second crossing the Kosciuszko Bridge out of Queens. The beetle has no offspring and prefers to be left alone, so when this one dies it takes its genetic line with it. We’re both the last of our families. This year is filled with bad news about the weather. News about new diseases in birds and mosquitoes. This year I illegally sublease a basement apartment in a giant pre-war building in Queens at least four degrees from the original leaseholder and thumbtack photos of all my friends, those I’ve lost and the ones I’ve haven’t yet met to the drywall. They’re either Polaroids or photos I print out using an app that makes the pictures look like old-school Polaroids. Outside my window is a Citgo sign I pretend is a rotating orange and blue moon. Late at night I kill the lights and look up at the men gathered below it bumming cigarettes, talking shit, listening to each other’s voices, responding with their own, I laugh along with their jokes. Do my best at performing the human ritual. Some nights I add my own humor to the darkness: Get this, guys. Knock knock: this is it.

 

At the last protest before my last protest I grow nauseated by the pageantry – the photo-op signage, the 300 dollar jackets with political slogans pre-sewn-in, the mind-numbingly repetitive chanting. Maybe the problem is that I understand too well. This is a salve for practitioners and the easily sated. Supermarket sheet cake for the choir. We’re gathered outside one of the president’s many towers, a handful of barricades have been prearranged for us to march in circles inside. We are yelling in this penned-in section of fencing while traffic moves freely around us, demanding justice as business goes on undisturbed. And even as we say these same words over and over, it’s clear we each have different definitions of what justice, and freedom, and power mean. What I know for sure is any word repeated enough ends up meaning nothing.

A group of friends ask me to take their picture. They’re laughing until the lens is trained on them and then, behind their signs, they make serious and severe faces for the internet. One of the girls compliments my anti-cop shirt (which I bought on Amazon) but not my makeup (which I stole from Sephora). There are official cameras surveilling us. The cameras stand in for police while the actual police sip free coffee in their cruisers.

To be here is to be alone surrounded by people – at once watched and invisible. Over these two hours we keep inquiring what democracy looks like, who owns these streets, and whether, if the people are united will they ever be defeated? The answers to me are clearly: not this, not us, we’re not, and, inevitably, we will be. The demonstration ends after about the length of a movie, and everyone goes home feeling better – as if we’ve done something, as if something’s been done.

I go home sick. Throw up my Burger King into the toilet. Check Twitter to see the protest trending for a moment, then gone.

 

It’s happened again. This time at the small grocery store on Grand. I’m minding my own business, trying to navigate the labyrinth of dry-goods’ bins and discounted plums, dodging new fathers failing to pilot their strollers and shopping carts at once. I have a red basket and am swinging its empty shell in my left hand like a small pendulum, a little metronome that keeps me grounded in the rush-hour chaos. I just wanted to pop in for something small to tide me over: bread and cheese, pre-bagged apples. But it’s so busy, it now seems I’ve somehow committed to living here and am scared I might start getting charged rent. I’m standing in the checkout line for what might be several lifetimes before I see him. Stupid, I think, stupid and shake my head until the produce blurs into oil paint. I go ahead and bury myself in my phone: open the grid of hungry torsos, twenty likes from some new stranger on Instagram, rearrange some candies. By the time it’s my turn in line, it’s clear the cashier boy both is and equally cannot be Edwin – I triple take, blink hard again, and yes, the nose is slightly different across the bridge, and he has those thick glasses that make his eyes seem bigger, almost like an insect’s. He’s still in his early twenties which of course he wouldn’t be now after all these years, smiling; not being dead.

Even our most direct family line is split like a tree with a vast underground root system. One living organism of quaking aspen in Utah, for instance, stretches out across 108 acres. Each trunk represents a whole life. You can trace your finger across the knotted roots and pass through different worlds. Most of my dad’s family lore ends half a century ago with a drunk, so he invents for me older odd folk tales, but if you do the simple math, just four generations back requires sixteen different people who suffered and laughed and made love out of nothing. They fled Russia, Poland, Yemen, Lithuania, and then there were thirty-two. On paper at least, when we left Egypt, there would have been tens of millions, though inbreeding and genocide throw a wrench in the lugwork of that math. According to biblical testimony, which is always to be trusted, it was 603,550 Israelites who fled to wander the desert, which outside a miracle could never support that much life. But what else is life? Besides blood, what ties us? Sometimes miracle is just another word for naming precisely what already exists. Thus, the villages and cities are many trees and many of them are gone, felled by time and fire, but the root system spread across Yiddishland and Palestine and Egypt and France and Brazil and Argentina and here in America.

When at last I die my xylem floods with all these stories at once and I’m so full I break into scripture, into sweat, into four unique seasons.

 

I’m wearing a sweatshirt that says usa. It’s red and the text across the chest is blue and white. I buy it off a street vendor, and even though it’s only 9.99 I offer him the whole contents of my wallet. Nod my head up and down at his look of surprise. I unbutton that man’s expensive shirt with its elegant French cuffs and stand there a moment, shirtless on the street. No one looks twice. I try folding the garment neatly but it keeps catching the wind so instead just lay it on top of a trash can in case anyone else might want it. I watch it fill and deflate as if a line of ghosts are passing through it. It’s February, and the weather is in terrible heat. Central Park’s spilling over with families like a net filled with some species of iridescent fish. The light is light but not enough. I lift the sweatshirt over my head and put my arms through it how you’d dress a child. For a moment, my whole head is under the cheap garment, and it’s almost as if I’m in a different world – a place where nothing is hurt, just a head moving slow through its red-cloth portal – and maybe on the other side we’ll find a country safe and orderly, perfectly formed as an egg. But my head emerges through the hole, my arms slide through the sleeves, and I’m still here. Midtown, with all these two-legged fishes moving around me, staring into their phones. Tourists ordering hot dogs and snapping selfies in front of Bergdorf Goodman. People in athleisurewear barking into the same blue-glowing angler headphones. The shops thrive as the world burns, selling expensive nothing: Swarovski crystal chandeliers, computer wristwatches, designer pig-leather hats. I can hear the drums in the near distance. I can feel the accelerant, heaving and sloshing, at the bottom of my bag.

    "text": "As a toddler she had caused a sensation in her family when she announced she wanted to live in a little hole like the ant. Not an ant, the ant. This might have been misheard.

She was an easygoing child, not particularly thoughtful and stubbornly inartistic. Her temperament was not in the least unruly or mystical. But when she was fourteen she was struck in the head by a surfboard and almost drowned. In a matter of moments she became an NDE-er, a member of that serene and suspect tribe of tinselly-like persuasion. Attempting to articulate her near-death experience, she found it differed scarcely at all from thousands of other accounts. There was the light, the empty road, the endless shore, the light, the tunnel, the ascent, the view of the unnecessary body below. The feeling of limitlessness, oneness, freedom, the sudden dismay at the obstruction, the shut door, the check, the thwart, the cruel boundary. Then the turning back, the forced retreat, the unpleasant feeling of being drawn down a kind of funnel, a cone …  

A therapist told her that she’d experienced a depersonalization, which is basically a psychological defense against death. The mind has many wiles.

I still feel that way, she said. Depersonalized. Like, whatever.

She wondered if she would see it again, that shining threshold, when it really mattered.

He had four thousand wings. This was simply a fact. The feathers of each wing—innumerable. As they should be. The wings sheltered the souls so they could not be viewed in transit. This too was correct. He also had a thousand eyes but not, as has been rumored, four heads. Azrael was spectacularly made and, as was so tirelessly depicted, looked nothing like Jesus, though in truth the Nazarene was not at all as rendered either. Jesus and Azrael were not well acquainted. They traveled in different circles. Jesus was surprisingly unfamiliar with death other than his own.

The birds of the air were terrified of Azrael. His murmurs of assurance were incomprehensible to them. Their bones were hollow and filled with air. The sweetest air. Wasn’t that enough?

The  number  of  souls  is  fixed.  Each birth is not the creation of a soul but the completion of the transmigration from one body to another. There is no such thing as a new soul. The souls made no sound as Azrael transported them. Never had one attempted to engage him in thought. The journey was made in perfect silence. They seemed wonderstruck.

She was lying on soft sheets in an old motel on the beach. The day was sunny and fresh with a clean sea breeze. It was the past, but now, she was immersed in it now. It was wonderful. She didn’t mind in the slightest that her friend wasn’t there. But then she started thinking about whales and grew sad. There were no whales here, the waters were too warm and shallow, but there were sharks. These were killed whenever seen. By the pool there was a red Coca-Cola machine with an endless supply of cold Cokes. In the room, above the bed, was a print of Foxes and Geese by Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein. She’d had to look it up, what it was. A peculiar choice for an old beach motel. Someone here was being just a little eccentric she thought. They were about to tear the place down any minute and they had actually. She had come here with friends or, in any case, a number of people she knew, but now she was alone, thinking about whales, worrying about them. They were in terrible danger. She couldn’t grasp the enormity of the whale, the extraordinariness of its life. Her own life had been quite unmysterious, but a whale’s life in the ocean! Amazing. Sound never ceases in the water. She’d learned that in school and it just stuck. Funny, certain things, the way they do after years and years. The depths were not silent at all. There was always sound—ticking and groaning and singing and shattering and the whales heard and comprehended it all. Whales did no harm and were possessors of the Ocean’s meaning. But they were being slaughtered. Oh she didn’t want to be thinking this. What if this were the last thing she’d be given to think?

On September 12, 2021, 1,428 dolphins in dozens of family pods were killed in the Faroe Islands. They’d been herded by motorboats, Jet Skis, and all manner of personal watercraft into a bay to be slaughtered on the beach. This was not commercial whaling, this was a community event, a yearly aquatic culling tradition that rather got out of hand. Six times more dolphins were killed in a single day than in an entire year. Usually it is pilot whales who are tapped for the free food in this cherished tradition but a large number of dolphins were sighted by some mariner and the community went delirious with excitement. As part of the tradition there are people on shore poised to dispatch the gifts of the sea with knives and an implement called a spinal lance, which is said to reduce killing time to one—well, possibly two—second(s), but there weren’t enough butchers on the beach (it’s always more fun to be on the boats) and so very many desperate and terrified and dying mammals that the one- (possibly two-) second refinement of the spinal lance couldn’t be humanely applied.

The intoxicating orgy of killing will have to serve as its own reward, for no one can really say how much of the flesh was processed and distributed to grateful Faroe Islanders. Or what was done with the carcasses of the families, or pods, if you will. There might be a tradition of respectful disposal though this is not likely. The remains were probably just dumped into the blood-black sea.

Tell me, the Devil said, what is the very worst thing that has happened to you?

Why? Azrael said. Then he parried. What is the very worst thing that ever happened to you?

He was aware this was not clever but he knew the Devil only wanted to talk about himself anyway. 

The fall, of course. My defining moment. He added, It’s been depicted many times. Of all the paintings, drawings, and such my favorite is by Gustave Doré. It shows me midcareen as I descend to earth. Paul-Gustave Louis Christophe Doré. He chose to be known as Gustave. Why, you might ask.

Azrael said, The name means “glorious guest.” It’s a rather popular name.

Fine artist, the Devil said. Dramatic. Excellent command of the line.

I’ve seen that portrait of you, Azrael said. You have it framed.

To my knowledge I have never invited you into my chambers, the Devil said loftily.

He’d always been vain. He’d been told it was one of his biggest problems.

 

HIS FAVORITE PICTURE

What I find impressive, the Devil said, is that you’re neither canonical nor noncanonical. That’s a remarkable balancing act. Good for you. But aren’t you supposed to have a book? A great book wherein you scribble down names and erase them constantly?

That’s just a tale. I couldn’t do that along with everything else I’m supposed to do, Azrael said defensively.

The Devil was always teasing him for his lack of independence. You are utterly under His command. And you take only the souls He commands you to take.

That’s still a lot, Azrael said.

What’s your attitude toward metempsychosis?

I am so fond of metempsychosis! Azrael said eagerly. I wish
I could do that exclusively. But times have changed so. The possibilities just aren’t there anymore.

Other forms of being becoming unavailable, are they? Extreme biodiversity loss? Species winking out right and left. Seventy percent of this gone. Seventy percent of that. It adds up.

Sadness descended upon Azrael. His many eyes closed for a moment. His feathers trembled.

But I must have faith that this is intended, he thought.

When she was ten she planted a cherry tree for her mother’s birthday. It was watered too heavily and died the following year. When she was twenty she planted a palm. Someone informed her that palms were not trees at all, which she considered debatable.

When she was thirty she planted a grapefruit tree and wished she had planted it ten years before. It sickened when they had to hook up to public sewer and the leach field dried. When she was forty she planted a copper beech. The town had taken down two mature ones to expand the hospital parking lot after the facility had been voted best rural hospital in the state two years in a row. It was only a slip of a gesture, she knew, her copper beech. When she was fifty she planted an oak, just a good sturdy oak, but she placed it too close to the electric lines and with the increase in broadband demand it was sheared and lopped to an unsurvivable degree. When she was sixty she sentimentally planted a cherry tree once more. When she was seventy she planted a mulberry tree over the objection of her neighbors, who found the berries attracted undesirable wildlife. When she was eighty she planted a hawthorn tree and was amused when the beautiful blossoms smelled rank rather than fragrant. She found amusing too, and this she would say to anyone inclined to listen, that though the Buddha was certainly no fool he had certainly overestimated our abilities to be responsible by a great deal.

You have minions, Azrael said.

So many, the Devil said. But I prefer to call them satellites. Quick! Is the moon a satellite?

Startled, Azrael said no.

It is a satellite, the Devil said gravely. Earth’s satellite. It controls the tides.

Well I do know that, Azrael said, embarrassed. 

It maintains order. The seasons and such.

Spring, Azrael mused. 

But not for much longer.

Is that true! Azrael exclaimed.

It will not tolerate forever human beings’ rude assaults—the probing and prodding and poking and collecting.

Misguided, Azrael said.

Have these people ever known what they were looking for? the Devil demanded.

Then he smiled. Azrael often made the foul fiend smile. He was so innocent, so eternally, newly fledged. And the Devil knew exactly what he was thinking. He was wondering if it could be mercifully forgotten that he didn’t know the moon was a satellite.

Lake Baikal in Siberia is a vast ancient lake, the deepest in the world. Near its shores are cemeteries that date back seven thousand years to the Neolithic period, the end of what is referred to as the Stone Age. Numerous graves have been found containing dogs, indicating that some animals were considered unique beings deserving of ritual burial after death. Several have been found harboring the remains of wolves, and there is none more extraordinary than that of the Wolf of Baikal at Lokomotiv, a slangy term for the site unearthed by the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. This large, fully articulated canid was lying on its left side with its head to the south. A line of ocher in the shape of an oval extended outward from the wolf’s front limbs. Positioned between its flexed legs were the cranium and mandible of an adult male human.
Paleontologists consider this most intriguing, even provocative, for the wolf’s positioning suggests that he is intended to accompany and protect a human beyond the gates of absence and death. Long before the birth of the gods, someone clearly hoped that both these beings would be together always.

Azrael was in the vanished forest, amidst the smoldering stumps. The silence here really was as fearsome as the grave’s. The sky seemed lifeless as well, a monstrously staring eye. Rain was falling hesitantly and sliding off the soil as if it were striking wax. More and more, Azrael was arriving too late for the world. The logging had taken place months ago and the great trees had long since gone through—what was it called—the processing sequence. The forest had been a living being and now it was not. Azrael felt a little sick. He was still more or less on time with humans but was finding it harder and harder to keep up with everyone else. Death was the dark crude brother; he was the shining inspiriting one. His duties had always been performed gracefully and he was appreciated for his punctuality and beautiful manners. But how could the immensity of the earth and all her other children be assisted to ensure their souls’ regeneration? His methods were being disrupted by the sheer precipitous magnitude of it all.

When she was a child they would drive in the spring over a mountain to visit her grandmother. It was called Bear Mountain and at its
peak were a gas station and a bear in a cage. Once, all the mountain had belonged to the bear and her family.

The bear wore a chain that she dragged back and forth across her allowance. Bits of oranges were scattered about her but they were not nice oranges. She had once had children, where were her children …

She had loved seeing the bear, aware that she was somehow misperceiving the situation. But she recognized a mystery and was greedy for it. It was the high point of the journey and the coming back too.

On these visits in the spring, her parents slept downstairs on a sofa in her grandmother’s house and she slept upstairs on a bed with her grandmother, an arrangement she did not like. At the bottom of the yard there was an outhouse. It was very clean, her grandmother kept it so. She lived alone, she did everything herself.

At some point in college, the child, grown, had taken the time to write in her textbook on seventeenth-century prose—The magical lines in Donne’s poetry are those which woke such conceptions as those of space time nothingness and eternity.

Now here she was, ill, aching, old, older than her grandmother had been when she died, older than her parents had been as well, wondering what she had ever wondered about.

The bear had always looked past her, not seeing her at all, not caring in the slightest that she would sometimes so unnecessarily appear.

Is that tree still there, do you know? the Devil asked.

No, Azrael said.

Now hold on, you’re not even going to ask which one?

I know the one you mean, Azrael said.

It was the great tree that grows below the throne of God. Each leaf has the name of a person on it and when the leaf detaches itself and commences to drop through the air, slowly, slowly, that person has forty days remaining of the only life they’d ever be aware of.

So what happened to it?

They went up as high as they could and cut the roots.

Really!

You had nothing to do with this?

I? Certainly not. I have always admired trees and the way they exist in an extra dimension. If any more are cut down, the earth will be terminally unhealed by the rain’s convulsions.

This one was quite extraordinary.

And what it offered was such a tender courtesy, the Devil sighed. No one appreciates the little kindnesses anymore. You’d think the idiots would have been grateful that their foolish names were being acknowledged at all.

 

COURTESY

When Azrael was an infant cub colt pup gosling, before tongues and eyes began covering his form and wings began to appear, each one more splendid than the one preceding, he had many questions, but after he met God only a few remained.

 

THE MEETING

 

 

16.



I have a request, she said.

Okay.

I wish to be buried with my horse.

He was shocked. He’s not even dead, he said. He knew this sounded stupid because she wasn’t dead yet either. This was the near future they were talking about. He’s still fresh, he ain’t but three years old, he added. It just seems a little mean.

You have to promise me.

You don’t ride him that much, he said, troubled. 

Because I can’t! I’ve been sick. I’m very sick. 

All right, all right, don’t get excited.

She kept changing the horse’s name. He supposed that wasn’t bad. It’s boats you’re not supposed to change the name of. It’s boats that’s unlucky. Some people who have wills change them over and over.

Did you have a dream or something?

It’s a vision. It comforts me. Why won’t you promise!

Okay, okay, he said. Don’t worry about it then. One less thing to worry about. 

One less thing, she said.

 

COME ALONG

When he was in one of his blue periods, the Devil feared that he had lost his edge, that alien awareness that sees matters differently, that thinks differently. That it was gone. And what remained had been embraced, enthusiastically embraced by the predictably human, the tares that made up his unholy aggregate. They were perennially hungry and impatient, they were boring. He couldn’t stand most of his followers, they were bums. And there were so many of them—it would appear that he had won. But he didn’t want to win, he wanted to keep playing the game.

The Devil had an infinite supply of sneakers and never wore the same pair twice, as far as Azrael could tell.

You know the reason we had the great falling-out was because I wasn’t supportive of that Adam and Eve business.

I’d heard that. It was a mistake, you think.

The proof is in the pudding.

I can imagine you must miss Him still. 

Oh, we remain tight as ticks.

Why are you speaking so strangely? Azrael said, concerned.

I’m tired. I’m running down. 

You mean you feel run-down?

Yes, that’s it. You know what He told me? I might as well share it with you. He said: The existence of creatures and their non-existence are the same.

He said that? 

Admitted it, yes.

He sounds a little tired too.

No, no, He’s always saying that, the Devil said.

This is another day, I know not what it will bring forth, but make me ready, Lord, for whatever it may be. If I am to stand up, help me to stand bravely. If I am to sit still, help me to sit quietly. If I am to lie low, help me to do it patiently. And if I am to do nothing, let me do it gallantly.

 

GALLANTLY

They’d been married for over forty years. No children, eleven cars, five houses, two DUIs, three infidelities, ten dogs. Innumerable breakfasts and cocktails. The Christmas trees could be counted, the putting up and the taking down, and the ornaments, carefully removed from their nests then replaced. The summers too. Those were the years when summers were a world apart. 

Oh my dear, my dear, he said. He stood by her bedside in the hospital. Their friends didn’t think his being there was a good idea. He’d actually been brought over from another institution. He suffered dementia, it wasn’t Alzheimer’s, he’d been assured. He had thick hair still, beautiful hair and large forthright ears.

A nurse brought water in cone-shaped paper cups. One was to drink it quickly, then the cup was discarded. This was understood. One couldn’t linger, holding it, or place it aside with its small offer of refreshment to be appreciated at a later time.

Oh my dear, my dear, I hate leaving you like this, he said.

She knew what he meant. They smiled quite blindly at one another. She was going to die! Her body knew it. It was amazing. Yet she was unalarmed. The trick was not to think you’re yourself.

Now when the Devil saw Azrael or, as it were, entertained his presence, he worried that he was experiencing the last time he would share his company. This was a recent phenomenon and quite unbearable.

Surely there had been a time when the Devil was unaware of him, but why try to determine when that was? It had been a time of darkness, puffy yet constricting darkness. There had certainly been nothing to look forward to.

The Devil liked him. He couldn’t recall liking anything quite so much. Such affection could cause nothing but worry, of course. The whole apparatus that Azrael embodied, enabled actually, was rickety, not built to last. Deferred maintenance. Delay delay delay. Judgment stayed forever. Forever and ever. Amen.

Azrael was enlightened but it was through pure ignorance, equipoisal ignorance indistinguishable from depthless wisdom. He had the radiant intelligence of an orphaned octopus larva. 

The Devil feared for him. Hadn’t he been gone rather longer than usual? Azrael and his duties, his heroic commitment, could drop from God’s attention like a stone down a well.

But then he appeared returned once more. Improbable glorious weary sorrowful. Still rejoicing, though the tiniest bit less.

 

THE ORPHAN

He is dreaming, surely. 

Two young men visit him. They are thin and blond. They wear jeans and white blouses.

They are here, they tell him.

They lead him into a large arena with clean sawdust on the floor. It is pleasantly bright but he’s unsure as to where the light is coming from. The windows, he notices, are covered with black cloth or paper.

There they are, they tell him.

Two elephants stand in one corner, their trunks entwined. His instinct is to speak, to ask a question, but then he feels it is better to be quiet. He is quiet.

Touch them, one of the angels says.

He makes his way toward the elephants. He walks and walks. The light never wavers though surely darkness has fallen by now."

    "text": "I’ve always loved salmon. Not to eat, as I don’t eat fish, but I’ve always loved salmon in general because salmon jump and no one knows why. They jump all over the place—out of rivers, up waterfalls. Some say they jump to clean their gills. Others say they jump for joy, because they love the smell of fresh rainwater. Still others say they jump to view their territory. It is certain that the salmon are jumping, but there is no absolute certainty as to why they jump.

You could say that this is true of many things. We are certain we are alive, but we are uncertain why. We are certain we are conscious, but we are uncertain why. Almost all “why” questions draw you into a realm of uncertainty, from why salmon jump to why we live and die. 

This story is partly about a beautiful salmon, and partly about the question of uncertainty. It’s also about the past and how we can’t get back there, except in our minds, and how this means the past is always uncertain.

I was living in Oslo at the time, studying philosophy at the university. Among the impressive tutors on the faculty, the best and greatest was an Icelandic philosopher called Alda Jónsdóttir. She was brilliant and also terrifying. She was a professor of logic but her main area was the things that fall out of sets. Superfluities, redundancies, gaps. She often said there were no sensible “why” questions, so we might as well discard them and move on to questions we could actually answer. She had masses of gray curly hair and she spoke and moved very quickly. In winter Oslo, the sidewalks are covered with a patina of treacherous ice. Nonetheless, Alda Jónsdóttir would stride along as if wearing crampons, in no danger of slipping at all, while I’d struggle beside her with little chastened footsteps, trying to stay upright on a surface that was more slippery than an ice rink. One day, when Alda Jónsdóttir was explaining something to me that I really didn’t understand, I slipped and landed with a hard thump on the ice, then slid on my ass downhill. As I struggled up again, Alda Jónsdóttir said to me: “Why did you do that?” Was that a philosophical joke? I wondered. Did philosophers make jokes? 

It was Alda Jónsdóttir who invited me to dinner. An invitation from a terrifying person must, inevitably perhaps, be terrifying. Also I came from nowhere, I really had no idea about the customs of anywhere else. I was habitually terrified, and Alda Jónsdóttir was an apex of terror in the midst of my quotidian terrorscape.

I said yes, anyway, because I was curious, if terrified. I was slightly more curious than terrified. And I wondered various things, like (a) who Alda Jónsdóttir lived with, if anyone; (b) where she lived; (c) what it was like there; and (d) what she would cook for dinner, if she cooked. I couldn’t imagine Alda Jónsdóttir doing anything as ordinary as cooking dinner. There was also the question of why she had invited me. But, as she often said, this was a pointless “why” question. 

I spent the hours leading up to the dinner in a state of predictable terror. I wasn’t sure what I should wear, so I found my only smart gray suit, which I could wear with the blue shirt my father gave me before he died. It was too big for me but it was the smartest thing I owned. I had a pair of black suede loafers that would be okay with the suit, I thought. Or would they? I had no idea if it was okay to wear black loafers with a gray suit. I had no idea if it was okay to wear black loafers in general.

For a few hours, I tried to busy myself with work. I was writing a very overdue essay about “saying the unsayable.” I really didn’t know what I was trying to say. Perhaps what I wanted to say was unsayable? Also, I couldn’t concentrate because I kept wondering: Was it okay to wear black loafers with a gray suit? What was okay, anyway? I got dressed in my uncomfortable gray suit, and my too-large blue shirt, and my black loafers. I took along a copy of Snow by Orhan Pamuk as a present. It seemed ridiculous to bring the great Alda Jónsdóttir a book—the temerity!—but I couldn’t think what else to take her, apart from a bottle of wine, which I intended to buy on the way. Then I walked out into the beautiful crisp evening. The air was full of the smell of hops, from the Ringnes brewery. Trams whirred past me but I liked the cold crisp air, so I carried on shuffling along.

In Norway, wine is really expensive, and you can buy it only from the government state shop, where it is heavily taxed. That’s quite bad already but on this occasion I’d messed up and the shop was closed by the time I arrived. You literally can’t buy wine anywhere else, only Vinmonopolet, the government shop. I had never really been to a dinner party before, but I knew you were meant to bring a bottle, or else! I was so confounded by this unexpected disaster that I stood outside Vinmonopolet and wept bitterly, as if I were such a raving drunkard that the prospect of an evening without wine was unbearable. People hurried past in their long dark coats and naturally they didn’t offer much sympathy. Actually that’s unfair—one person did pause, and offered the proverbial phrase “Liten tue kan velte stort lass,” which roughly means “The straw that broke the camel’s back.” Then they told me, less sympathetically, to stop blocking the path.

It was good advice. I continued. Shuffling along. No wine! A massive epic of disaster! Of course, it was a small social embarrassment really but these things can weigh heavily upon you when you are young and uncertain and have no real idea what the hell you should do amid all this confusion and beauty and madness and terror. And that was just on a cold winter’s night in a beautiful city like Oslo—imagine how it would be, I thought as I kept shuffling along, imagine what would happen if they sent you to fight in a war, you numbskull, what the hell are you even thinking about, weeping like a fool because you can’t buy a stupid bottle of wine! I said those sorts of things to myself, then I fell on the ice and got up again, and finally—still berating myself vividly—I reached the door.

Alda Jónsdóttir lived in Grünerløkka, which was the best place to live in Oslo. Not in terms of being the most ostentatious and expensive place—those sorts of places were down by the harbor, overlooking the water, as they often are in big cities. But it was the best place in terms of being full of elegant squares with ice shimmering on the sidewalks as if one of the billionaires in the
harbor had dropped diamonds everywhere and not bothered to clear them away. The streetlights sputtered onto the shining ice, and the moon above was a perfect toenail clipping, among nacreous clouds.

Finally, I buzzed. And the buzzer whirred, and a voice—not Alda Jónsdóttir’s—said, “Kom inn!”

There’s one thing I should explain at this point: all this terror was misplaced. The business about the shoes, for example. I went upstairs and Alda Jónsdóttir’s husband, Guðmund Guðmundsson (the voice from the buzzer—a tall, wizard-like man, seven feet tall or so, like a benevolent Viking deity, who was a professor of astronomy), invited me to leave my shoes outside their door. In Norway you always take off your outdoor shoes before entering a home. I had forgotten. If anything I should have been more concerned about my socks. They were full of holes. That’s what I should have amended, not the black shoes. But if you’re in a state of mindless terror, as I generally was, you don’t think clearly. So, I went in, with holes in my socks and my stupid black shoes outside the door, as if they’d ever mattered. Then of course everyone was dressed in jeans and sweaters and I was wearing a formal suit. I took off the jacket at once, rolled up the sleeves of my dad’s shirt, and went inside, trying to explain that I had no wine, the shop was closed, but here, here was a book—

“Ah yes, Snow!” said Alda Jónsdóttir, putting it on a table. “Thanks. And we don’t care about wine. We drink spirits. Come in!”

She had pulled her masses of gray hair into a plait, she was wearing slacks and a shirt, very relaxed and beautiful. The apartment was large, heavily decorated with scenes from Iceland, all painted by the Viking deity Guðmund. I stood there nervously and foolishly, until Guðmund handed me a drink I would call Poison. That was the effect it had on me. But it was actually called Black Death—an Icelandic spirit made from mashed potatoes, or something.

“You eat it with a little piece of dead shark,” said Guðmund.

“I don’t generally eat shark,” I said.

“Not even pickled shark?” he said, waving a little jar beneath my nose.

“Not even pickled,” I said. “But thank you so much. That looks amazing.”

There were a lot of people there. Cool, distinguished, at the top of their cool, distinguished fields. I was very intimidated. My clothes were far too formal. I kept being introduced to people and nodding sagely as they spoke their names then forgetting what they’d said five seconds later. To douse my nerves, I drank a lot of Black Death, far too much as we stood around, and far too much as we sat at the dining table. It tasted delicious, so crisp and cold. It was like drinking the cold air beyond the window.

It turned out the Black Death was stronger than hell. It was so strong that after a while I began to hallucinate. The paintings on the wall were moving, I thought. Lava fields, in motion. A man, smiling. I was not only drunk but off my rocker. It was a really bad situation. There were a dozen people around me, maybe more, and now their facial expressions seemed antic. And possibly insincere. Were they acting? I was just trying to work this out when Alda Jónsdóttir slapped an enormous dish onto the center of the table. As she did this everyone exclaimed, “What a beautiful salmon!”

It was enormous and it seemed to be breathing. And, it seemed to be floating. One or both of these, I understood, must be effects of the Black Death. Otherwise, something very odd was going on with the salmon. Either way, in front of me was a beautiful salmon that had been cooked in a fish kettle and then decorated copiously, with gorgeous arrangements of parsley and dill and lemons. There were little dishes of salad and vegetables everywhere, but the centerpiece, the focal point of the meal, for sure, was the beautiful salmon. Levitating. Breathing. Alda Jónsdóttir had cooked it herself.  

And more than that. As everyone exclaimed about the beauty of this fish, Alda Jónsdóttir explained that she had risen that morning at 4 A.M. and driven to Arendal, a mere six-hour round trip as everyone else at the table knew (and I discovered later), because her old friend Kristoffer Peterson lived in Arendal and he was a fisherman, and he had caught the most beautiful salmon, he said, and wanted her to cook it. He was something of an expert on salmon, of all kinds, and he thought it was the most beautiful salmon he had ever seen. “Anyway,” said Alda Jónsdóttir, because everyone was now saying that this was too much fuss, “I wanted to see Kristoffer. I never get to see him!”

She flicked her hair away from her face, a single strand that had tumbled out of her plait. She looked embarrassed, almost—was that possible?

“No no, really,” she said in response to a further volley of exclamations about how this was too much, far too much effort—it was clear this was beginning to trouble her. There is a line—a very slender line—between expressing torrential gratitude and giving someone the impression they’ve made a fool of themselves by trying too hard. Somehow we were all on that line. At least I wasn’t, because I couldn’t speak, but the others were dancing along this tightrope and one by one, it seemed, they all fell to the wrong side, meaning that they all started to suggest that Alda Jónsdóttir had made too much of a fuss. “You really really shouldn’t have” started to sound less like an expression of gratitude and more like an expression of, What the hell are you doing, driving to Arendal for a salmon? Do you have too much time on your hands? They didn’t mean it to sound like that, but somehow, on that other side of the tightrope, it did.

Alda Jónsdóttir began to look flustered. She pushed the strand of errant hair away from her face again and said, “Really! Shut up, all of you! You’re making me blush! It’s just a fish!”

But no one believed her anymore.

“More drink?” said Guðmund, siphoning more Black Death into everyone’s glasses, to shut them all up. I drank it down, nervously. He filled my glass again.

Clearly I was in trouble, aside from the hallucinations, because I couldn’t eat the salmon. I never eat any kind of salmon, either as a full fish or a salmon-based product such as salmon pâté. Afflicted as I was by Black Death, I couldn’t think what to do about anything. Especially the lava fields, which were not only moving but hovering away from their frames as if the room would soon become a lava field. Then what?

The only positives of the situation were that (a) everyone else was also afflicted with Black Death, and (b) they would—therefore—hardly notice if I ate the salmon or not. 

On one side of me was a poet called Amari Blomdahl who moved her hands as she spoke, as if she were patting something imaginary in front of her. Or as if there actually was something in front of her, which she could see and no one else could, and which needed her to comfort it—also possible in the circumstances. On my other side was a philosopher called Ole Lauge, who was tall with gray-black hair and a shy, trembling, sensitive manner. He was so shy he could barely speak, until he became very drunk. Then he started speaking quite a lot, and he told me his latest philosophical work was called Listen!

“Because all we do is speak!” he said. “Everyone speaks and no one listens. How about you? What would you like to say?”

“I’m listening,” I said.

It wasn’t that I had any high moral principles on this matter. I was just stricken with nerves. 

“No you’re not!” he said. “Not really!”

“Yes I am!” I said. “I’m listening to you telling me to listen!”

“Ha!” he said. “I guess that’s the fatal disproof of my argument. Touché! All you have to do is listen, and I disappear in a puff of logic. Ha! But did you really want to listen, or did you just want to disprove my argument? That’s the question! I’ve struggled with that! It’s such an easy disproof. It’s just—bang! Dead! My argument is dead! People stay quiet just long enough to kill it, then they start speaking again!” He said all of this so sadly, I didn’t know how to respond. 

It was quite the wrong time to get up and leave the table, and Lauge duly exploded: “See! You think you’ve won, so now you don’t even need to listen!” I went to the bathroom, to splash water on my face. I had to shuffle there very slowly, as if I were still walking on ice. In the bathroom I threw water all over my dead dad’s nice blue shirt and wondered where he was, and then I realized I was crying, and I tried to clean that up, the mess on my dad’s shirt and also my face, and then I got more water, threw it on my face, on my shirt, on the floor, tried to clean that up, then I stood again and looked in the mirror—my face had gone. It had vanished! Altogether! I looked down carefully at my hands. Still there. I touched my face. There! Just not visible, it seemed, within the ordinary world. Or the ordinary world had gone. Mmm. There wasn’t anything to do, I thought. My face would come back. Or it wouldn’t. One day, even tomorrow, I would be sober and I would have a face again. My invisible face was flaming. After splashing more water on it, which didn’t help, I shuffled back into the dining room.

At the table, something had happened. Lauge had just said something, it seemed, and everyone was looking at him in total horror. They were listening intently, either in deliberate or accidental disproof of his argument that no one listens. They were really listening, though in total horror, and they all looked as if they were doing impressions of The Scream in a game of charades, art-classics version.

“But Alda,” Lauge was saying. “You must know I’m angry with you. That’s why you invited me over, isn’t it?”

“No,” said Alda Jónsdóttir. “It’s not. I had no idea you were angry with me. We’re friends, that’s why I invited you over. But come on, Lauge, tell me your deepest thoughts.”

That was a disarming phrase, I thought, but also alarming. Do we really want to know people’s deepest thoughts? Do they even know them? I had these questions running around in my poisoned brain and I was also trying very hard not to slump, because my body was desperate to slump by this stage. It wanted to slump face-first, face-planting into my plate. I could feel Lauge tensing beside me, even clenching his fists.

Lauge’s deepest thoughts were as follows. He was upset with Alda Jónsdóttir because she had recently judged the Elden Prize, the biggest philosophy prize in Norway, and had given it to a philosopher called Anders Karlson, who was a fraud, in Lauge’s opinion. Moreover, at the ceremony she had called Anders Karlson the greatest philosopher of his generation, “leading the vanguard”—now Lauge was quoting by heart, suggesting a slightly obsessive approach to this theme—“leading the vanguard in his beautiful, nuanced, and dextrous modes of philosophical thinking, and providing an immaculate example to the rest of us of how to have mutually respectful philosophical debates in which we genuinely hear one another and listen . . .”

“I mean,” said Lauge. “Tell me your deepest thoughts, for once? I’d love to hear them!”

“Why are you so angry about this?” said Alda Jónsdóttir. “I never knew you were so petty! Why do you want some little bauble, Ole Lauge? What does it even mean to you? Do you think Aristotle cared if he got the Elden Prize? What are you talking about?”

“Yes, of course!” said Ole Lauge. “At one level, the world of forms is an illusion. Obviously! Nonetheless that is six million kroner and Karlson is the heir to a massive shipping fortune, his family are rolling in it—why give him even more money? He couldn’t even be bothered to come to the ceremony!”

“Well, that’s his choice,” said someone else—one of the people whose names I’d heard and immediately forgotten. “Why do you care, Ole? Chill out!” This intervening voice of sanity looked like the son in Festen, if you’ve seen that film—the one who confronts the evil abusive father. Really uncannily like that.  

“I care because he’s rich,” said Lauge. “Firstly. And I’m not. And my wife died. I care about that. And I have to look after my kids alone. And I can’t work, but I must work, because otherwise, we have nothing. But also, I care because he’s rubbish. And fine, I’m rubbish too. We’re all rubbish. You’re a rubbish philosopher, Fridtjof Ericsson . . .”

Ah! I thought, That’s his name! 

“. . . and you, Amari, are a rubbish poet and this kid beside me is—well—a rubbish—” Now he paused, and turned to me in confusion. “What are you rubbish at, if you don’t mind me asking?”

I didn’t have a clue how to answer that!

“That’s my student,” said Alda Jónsdóttir. “And yes, a kid. Enough!”

“You’re right,” said Lauge. “Enough!” He expressed his further apologies with a wildly drunken hand movement that almost smacked me in the mouth. “My point being, everyone is rubbish. That’s the secret of the universe. All these feted people and they’re completely rubbish. You know that. I know that! We’re all rubbish! But if you’re going to dish out rubbish prizes, then why pretend otherwise, why be so dishonest and claim that this generic rubbish is somehow great and beautiful? I thought you were my friend!”

“Ole Lauge, it’s just a prize,” said Alda Jónsdóttir, and a few people chimed in. The guy from Festen (I’d forgotten his name, again, really, it was absurd), and Amari, who really didn’t like being called a rubbish poet (who does?), and Guðmund, who was trying to defend Alda Jónsdóttir. As they all chimed in, the argument became more heated. But Lauge wasn’t listening to anyone.

Alda Jónsdóttir tried again, wringing her napkin in a way that suggested deep existential turmoil. Everyone was watching Ole Lauge as he waved his hands furiously, and they were watching Alda Jónsdóttir as she tried again, wringing her napkin.

“Ultimately I don’t care,” she said. “I think that’s it. I don’t care that you didn’t win the prize. Why do you care so much? It’s quite bemusing. Are you really expecting me to have a serious argument about this? It’s such a waste of time, when we could be discussing any number of other more interesting things.”

Lauge was just saying, “For God’s sake Alda Jónsdóttir, why don’t you LISTEN!” when he waved his hand wildly again, so wildly that he swept a bottle of Black Death across the table. It was a big heavy bottle made of lots and lots of glass, and it catapulted across the table, far too quickly for anyone to save it. Soon it was flying beyond the reach of anyone, even Lauge and his desperate waving hands—and then it smashed into a water jug and several glasses, and then all these frangible objects smashed into the beautiful salmon. They smashed into, and across, and within, and over, the beautiful salmon. Had you intended to fill a fish with broken glass, you couldn’t have done it more effectively. It was immaculate in that respect, but a complete disaster in every other respect.

In a second, the salmon was covered in powdery debris and little shining shards. All the decorations were further embellished by this shining patina of beautiful—yet clearly inedible—pieces of shattered glass.

If people had looked as if they were doing novelty impressions of The Scream before, now they looked as if, in their view, Munch’s portrait of existential agony was insufficient. They were more like the creations of Egon Schiele. Twisted and contorted, wrecked entirely. The salmon, also, was wrecked but it was still beautiful, with its little garnishes of parsley and dill, its lovely arrangements of lemons, its bright pink flesh, cooked presumably to perfection—

“Fy faen, oh my God,” said Lauge. “I have fucked up your fish.”

“You have, a little,” said Alda Jónsdóttir, who had begun to laugh, if mostly in horror. This meant everyone else could laugh, if mostly in horror, which was a great relief. Everyone laughed apart from Lauge, who was too horrified.

“No no,” he said. “It was such a beautiful salmon. And you went to Arendal. And I have ruined it. I have ruined everything!”

Then he burst into tears.

You can’t laugh if someone is crying, so everyone immediately tried to stop laughing, though there was a slight delay while everyone made the transition. This felt awful because there was a moment when Lauge was weeping, volubly, and everyone was laughing, like a weird tableau. Then with a loud, agonizing scrape of his chair, Lauge stood up and walked out of the room. At first I thought he might just leave altogether, but then the door of the bathroom slammed shut.

The beautiful ruined salmon lay there in front of us, glistening with glass. It was so sad. No one said anything for a while. It felt like a wake for a salmon. Then Alda Jónsdóttir said, very quietly, as if it were a secret: “When he comes back in we must all be kind to him, because clearly he’s made a fool of himself.”

“Of course,” said Festen. “Perhaps I was a little harsh. But, there’s a sort of entitlement, don’t you think, in what he was saying, about expecting the prize and so forth? I mean, no one has a right to anything!” But Alda Jónsdóttir gave him a stern look, and he raised a hand. “All right, all right. Okay!”

When Lauge returned, having splashed himself so liberally with cold water that his shirt was soaked, he averted his gaze from the ruined salmon—perhaps to show respect. It looked at him, nonetheless, with its one reproachful eye.

“I’m terribly sorry,” said Lauge. He was leaning on the table, beside Alda Jónsdóttir, ashen-faced and panting as if he’d been running very hard.

“No no,” said Alda Jónsdóttir, leaping to her feet, giving him a big hug, banging him repeatedly on the back, almost angrily. “I’m really sorry. Please! You should say whatever you want. Of course! And these things matter to varying degrees to different people. And I’m so sorry about your wife. Of course, we’re all so sorry.”

“Well that’s definitely not your fault,” said Lauge, as Guðmund stood and led him gently back to his seat, then stuffed him also gently into it, as if he were an oversize child. “I don’t normally drink, you see,” Lauge was saying. “But I felt awkward today and, you know, I miss my wife. I’m not sure I even care about the stupid prize.”

He started crying again.

By now he was so penitent that everyone who had been fervently irritated by his egomaniacal behavior—which was basically everyone at the table—changed their minds entirely and began to pity him, with equal fervor. At least, I did. To be honest I can’t really speak for the others. But I felt very sorry about everything. I was nothing to him, but I tried to pat him on the arm. He didn’t seem to notice.

“Well,” said Alda Jónsdóttir. “It genuinely doesn’t matter about the fish. I couldn’t care less. After all the main purpose of the evening is to talk, and the salmon is not required in order for us to talk. And there are plenty of other things to eat.”

She stood and cleared the salmon away. Meanwhile, to distract everyone from the scene change, Festen told a story about how people used to torture or perhaps it was murder prisoners by making them eat glass, so it wouldn’t be a good idea to eat the beautiful salmon at this stage. It was meant to be a distraction but the story was oddly violent and didn’t really help anyone. He subsided fairly quickly. Alda Jónsdóttir came back with some pots of herring and that bright pink salami you get in Norway and also the golden cheese that tastes as sweet as honey. I was still very drunk but now I realized: it didn’t matter. Nothing I did that evening would ever matter. It was a great relief. I actually wondered if Lauge could hire himself out as a professional disruptor and go from one house to another as an antidote to social terror. But that was the fermented mash talking, I expect. 

Lauge’s wife had died of cancer, a few weeks earlier. He’d looked after her, and their three children, for five years, while working as a full-time teacher. He didn’t have a university post; he was a high school teacher who wrote about philosophy in his spare time. He was exhausted and really angry. He was angry with the universe for taking away his wife, so randomly and cruelly. But the universe was faceless, implacable, so instead he’d become angry with Alda Jónsdóttir about something relatively unimportant. Perhaps he just wanted the universe to pat him on the back and say it was sorry. And if not the universe then, at least, Alda Jónsdóttir.

I didn’t know any of this at the time. Then again, I didn’t know any philosophers at the time, either, so I just thought this was how they behaved. Sudden furies and then tears, and then they all made up and ate copious amounts of herring. Also I was out of my mind on Black Death so it was almost impossible to judge anything. All night everyone had these cartoonish expressive faces, very arresting and unusual. And when I finally walked home, a little shadow danced beside me all the way up the hill to Torshov, quite friendly but dark and shape-shifting, so one moment it was a fox and the next it was a cat, and the next it was a small bouncing cloud of vapor.

The following day, the little dancing shadow had danced away and I had a relentless noise in my head, as if part of my skull had been dislodged and was banging like a gate in a storm. On the plus side, I could see my face in the mirror again.

People often talk about learning experiences and, in the days after this salmon-based fiasco, I wondered about this. One thing I had already learned from Alda Jónsdóttir was that conclusions are fallacies of formal systems, or something along those lines. By that logic, all conclusions are uncertain, including the conclusion that all conclusions are uncertain, and so on. Still, one thing I learned from all of this: names are often significant. Even if you agree with Alda Jónsdóttir that no formal system can precisely capture the formlessness of life, even then—a drink called Black Death is unlikely to be very good for you. Furthermore, I really hadn’t needed to worry about everything I was so absurdly worried about, due to the law of unintended consequences. We can be stressing ourselves senseless about possible events, striving to avert them, but then everything is demolished by an unimagined and previously unimaginable event. Nonetheless, like Alda Jónsdóttir, we try our utmost, we travel to the psychic or physical equivalent of Arendal, there and back again, we make the most extraordinary efforts to ensure that things will be okay, for us and for those around us. Yet, suddenly, there is a shattering of glass and the beautiful salmon is ruined entirely. Then we have to start all over again—striving and hoping. Perhaps that’s pushing things too far, but that was what I learned from the evening. And that grief is terrible and sends you mad, though I knew something of that already. But mostly the part about the beautiful salmon."

    "text": "On the cold night of November 24, 1997, before Shahid disappeared forever, I thought I was his closest friend, his only confidant. We had known each other since we were children, attended primary and high school together, even gone to the same college in Lahore, but he was bewildering from the start. 

He was fortunate enough to be the son of a wealthy feudal lord and not of an ordinary civil servant like me, but when I think back to his childhood, it seems unlikely that he should have gone on to take the remotest interest in philosophy. His three brothers all dropped out of school, and everyone knew that his father, Malik Aslam, was barely literate. Malik Sahib liked to brag that he’d read just one book in his life, the Holy Quran⁠⁠—the only book Shahid would never touch. His mother’s death when he was fifteen had altered his nature, striking the words for God from his lexicon. Having been a carefree, spirited boy, he became solitary and reclusive. He quit cricket and sought refuge in the municipal library, where he would read all day until it closed. 

In college, he studied English literature, and every day after class, he would stop by Pak Tea House to eavesdrop on the conversations of writers, one of whom introduced him to surrealism. Soon he was channeling his energies into a novel in the style of Breton’s Nadja⁠⁠—he titled his “Nazia”⁠⁠—set in our hometown of Sheikhupura, where the young hero roamed the deserted alleyways, increasingly estranged from his city, on the trail of a strange woman about whom he knew nothing. Shahid never did finish the book, though, because in his third year, he developed his next fixation.

He had enrolled in a course called Initiation into Philosophy, taught by an eager young instructor named Sheiz with a passion for postmodernism and deconstruction. Sheiz liked to lend his students books from his personal library, or to buy them cheap paperbacks off the towpath at the Anarkali bazaar on Sundays. But Plato’s Republic, Spinoza’s Ethics, Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation, and Sartre’s Being and Nothingness all proved disappointing to Shahid. Sheiz was determined, though, and one Sunday morning he presented Shahid with Derrida’s Glas: “You must read this, it has fire inside it. Fire!” The text was printed in two columns, each containing a discourse so distinct from, so incompatible with the other⁠⁠—on the left, reflections on Hegel; on the right, meditations on Jean Genet’s erotic metaphors⁠⁠—that it was hard to believe they had materialized from the same pen. It seemed that, in this book alone, philosophy and poetry, intellect and passion, conscious and subconscious had come face-to-face. 

Shahid read it on the rickshaw home from the bazaar and in his dormitory until dawn. In the morning, he came to my room with Glas under his arm and told me that it had reoriented his life’s compass. He transferred to the philosophy department, started studying French at L’Alliance Française, and became involved with the Thinkers’ Coven, a small society of Sheiz’s students that met each month to discuss some lofty concept. I attended a few of those meetings myself, and found them tedious and impenetrable⁠⁠—in truth, I grasped barely a word. But Shahid was a fearsome participant. His criticisms often deeply offended people, yet he argued on without a thought for their wounded feelings. He was not afraid to be unpopular, having assumed a surrealist koan as his mantra: “What other people reproach you for, cultivate. It is yourself.”

Eventually, in an especially heated debate, he took it too far. A student from a local religious organization was so affronted by Shahid’s atheistic remarks that he shared them with his group. They launched a protest movement against Shahid, and against Sheiz, too, whom they accused of coercing Shahid into voicing what Sheiz didn’t have the nerve to say himself. The campaign gathered momentum, and the Thinkers’ Coven was banned. Shahid and Sheiz decided to flee, Shahid to Sheikhupura and Sheiz to the United States. As for me, my life and reputation were too dear⁠⁠—I cut my ties with Shahid as soon as the protest movement started. Sometimes I’d wonder if I should visit his father to ask after him, but something or other always forced me to postpone, until one Sunday the landline rang. 

“Irfan, how are you?” Shahid’s voice boomed on the other end. 

“Sheeday! Where are you? Are you okay?” 

“Yaara, don’t worry about me. I’m in Paris and I’m very happy. I’m attending Derrida’s seminar!” 

I congratulated him, but in truth I felt resentful. I was in my final semester then⁠⁠—soon I’d have to move back home and find a job. I knew that a belittling, boring small-town life awaited me, while there he was in France, basking in firsthand instruction from the world’s busiest and most renowned philosopher. He recounted how, when the campaign against him was gathering momentum, he had locked himself in his room, hardly ever venturing out. When his father saw how scared he was, he resolved to send Shahid abroad for a while. Malik Sahib could have sent him to practically any city in the world, but Shahid claimed he wanted to practice his French. Of course, his father played right into his hands.  

 

 

For ten months after that call, there was no word. Then, when I was at the market buying groceries one afternoon, I ran into Shahid. Was he here for the holidays? He explained bitterly that his father had summoned him back. His accusers seemed to have forgotten about him and moved on to a new offender. There had been an opening for a teacher of philosophy at Govt. College, and his father had recommended him to the dean. 

I wanted to hear about his time in Paris, so I took him to Al-Fateh Hotel⁠⁠—our hometown’s Pak Tea House⁠⁠—in my old wreck of a car. I was teaching history now in one of Sheikhupura’s high schools, and I had made the hotel my nightly camp. The literary figures of the city would gather there every evening: the novelist Sabir Chattha, the poet Nasim Jami, the journalist Shaukat Ali, and the professor and columnist Hafeez Iqbal Bukhari, each holding court for hours. That afternoon, Shahid and I were there alone. Over cigarettes and chai, he told me how, when he arrived at Charles de Gaulle Airport, he’d given a taxi driver an address written on a scrap of paper. “But you are not blind,” the driver said. “What are you going to do there?” Indeed, the building at 49 rue Blanche was the Union of the War Blind, a home for veterans who had lost their sight in combat. A friend of his father’s who hailed from Sialkot⁠⁠—now a restaurateur and casino owner in Paris⁠⁠—had found Shahid lodging there. His room had no windows and was dark even during the daytime. The funny thing, he told me, was that on the flight over he’d been reading Derrida’s Memoirs of the Blind⁠⁠—a book in which poets, thinkers, and prophets, though deprived of eyesight, were abundant in insight, guiding those who were able to see. 

That same day, he went to the École des hautes études en sciences sociales to inquire about Derrida’s seminar and was informed that it would begin in four weeks. Four weeks was a long time! He immediately joined the Sainte-Genevìeve library, where, with dictionaries piled around him, he studied Derrida’s books from dawn to dusk. The language was so complex, the ideas so ambiguous and difficult, that from time to time he would feel frustrated and take a break to wander the shelves in the reference section. One day, he picked up De l’inconvénient d’être né (The Trouble with Being Born) by Emil Cioran, and, on opening it, came upon the sentences “To have committed every crime but that of being a father” and “In the deepest part of yourself, aspire to be as dispossessed, as lamentable as God.” Those two merciless phrases compelled him to read the entire book, and as he did he realized that it was also about deconstruction⁠⁠—of the false and disgusting condition known as optimism. He wondered what Derrida might make of Cioran’s philosophy, but he could find no mention of Cioran anywhere in Derrida’s books. What a shame that Derrida had written an entire book on a common philosopher like Condillac and devoted a long essay to Nietzsche’s banal sentence “I have forgotten my umbrella,” but hadn’t bothered to write even a word or two on a great philosopher like Cioran!

Finally, the day he had been so desperately waiting for arrived: October 25, 1995, a Wednesday. At precisely five o’clock, he walked into the Ecole’s packed lecture hall, where thousands of students were talking noisily in all kinds of languages⁠⁠—as though the children of the builders of the Tower of Babel had gathered there. Then came a sudden hush⁠⁠—Hazrat Derrida was about to appear. Puffing on his pipe, carrying a heavy bag, he made his way toward the desk in the middle of the stage. Derrida Sahib was wearing a great many layers, and as he approached the desk he began removing them one by one, hanging them on the back of the chair. He peeled off a raincoat, a jacket, a cardigan, a vest, a jersey, until his muscular torso was clothed in only a light sweater. The act seemed pregnant with meaning⁠⁠—a gesture toward the task before him, the layers of meaning that must be stripped away in the course of the seminar. Then Derrida took his seat, drew his papers from his bag, and lay them down. “Ladies and gentlemen,” he announced, “I assure you that what will be said over these weeks will be nothing other than the sum of the words of fictional people brought to life for a moment, and that their words will not bring us face-to-face with the possible. It is the impossible, instead, that we must confront. We will try to bring about something else, something ‘other,’ through an indefinable course that will be the source of our discussion⁠⁠—its goal⁠⁠—but that will forever remain outside its bounds. We will touch the impossible.”

After this announcement, Derrida presented the key question of the seminar series⁠—“Can death be given?”⁠⁠—and launched into his talk. That day, he spoke for two hours. The audience slipped into a hypnotic trance. By the time he finished, everyone seemed intoxicated. Without a sound, they stood and moved out of the hall like sleepwalkers. It had rained all day, and the stars were playing hide-and-seek on the damp surface of the road as Shahid stumbled toward the Métro station. He noticed that a man who had been sitting in front of him in the lecture hall was now walking ahead, and he felt greatly comforted. It was strange⁠⁠—he did not know this man, nor where he was from or what his name was, but Shahid felt a psychic kinship with him. Here was an ally who could come to his aid, one for whom he would readily lay down his life. This was Derrida’s magic, that he had brought two such souls together. That day, Derrida became Shahid’s guide, his murshid.

At the second seminar, Derrida explained that he would be discussing Blanchot’s story “The Instant of My Death,” for the answer to their central question was concealed within it, and a meticulous excavation would be required. The story was eight pages long and Derrida could surely have taken it apart in an hour or two, but no⁠⁠—his deconstruction would last for the next eight months. From Blanchot’s most ordinary turns of phrase Derrida could extract vast peaks and valleys, whole universes of meaning. Within every word he found a world. 

Most of the students at Derrida’s seminars, Shahid said, would never criticize the philosopher⁠⁠—to do so would feel akin to blasphemy. But there was one heretic, a fifty­-year-­old man, broad and muscular, with hair down to his shoulders, his small eyes filled with contempt. The rest of the crowd, Shahid included, despised this vulgar man and would not even look his way, but he seemed utterly oblivious, concerned with Derrida alone. During the short Q&A that followed each session, he would raise his hand and state his name (Francis Bertin), launch into a vociferous critique of a few of Derrida’s remarks, and pose one or two questions that nobody understood. As soon as Bertin put up his hand, Derrida would make a face. Yet he would listen with unfailing attention to the transgressor’s unfounded criticisms and questions, and reply, “Yes, you are absolutely right.” 

 

 

After nominating Derrida as his murshid, Shahid was bound by all the duties of a protégé⁠⁠—chief among them to collect Derrida’s books as if they were sacred relics and to put them by his bedside. There was hardly any money left for food. Following the purchase of Memoires for Paul de Man, he survived on dry cornflakes for four weeks (there was no money for milk), and after buying Parages his diet was limited to plain bread (there was no money for jam or butter). But Margins of Philosophy inflicted the greatest pains. Purchasing this formidable book depleted his daily nutrient intake even more. He was now down to two slices of bread a day. 

Hunger gnawed at him constantly, causing many challenges. One problem was that his empty stomach would growl loudly at any time or place⁠⁠—the Métro, the library, bookstores, the lecture hall, and upon first waking in his bedroom, where the loving darkness would bid him good morning. He would devour the first slice then, and the second at night, starving himself during the day such that his gastric pleas would offend his colleagues and neighbors. Frown lines would wrinkle their foreheads as they glared at him with revulsion, and he would feel humiliated. But he did not let his shame hold him back. Shahid harbored a fierce longing to talk to Derrida, though he grew anxious at the thought, because his spoken French was weak, his thoughts scattered. He needed time to prepare. As the year went on, his language grew more refined, his thoughts more lucid, and at the start of each session he would vow that today, as soon as the lecture ended, he would go up and speak to his professor. But every time, he became flustered and instead joined the throng of students heading for the exit. Months passed in this delaying, until finally the matter could not be deferred any longer⁠⁠—the last day of the seminar had arrived. What was so important that Shahid had to say it to Derrida? He barely knew. But he had come from so far, and still a great philosophical quest awaited him, one for which he needed his murshid’s blessings to succeed.  

In that final lecture, Derrida laid out his new theory of “negative theology” and again cast a spell over the entire hall. After everyone else had left, Shahid remained, gazing at Derrida as he slowly gathered his papers. For once, no sycophants were buzzing around. Shahid rose and started walking when suddenly a wave of dizziness washed over him⁠⁠—he was so weak and malnourished. What irony that the man he was trying so hard to reach was the very same man who had reduced him to this wretched state, barely able to cross the room! With great effort, he kept going. He was close to Derrida now. He was putting the last of his papers into his bag, which was crammed full.

Hearing footsteps, Derrida looked up. Their eyes met for an instant, but Derrida’s were like two X-ray machines, and Shahid lowered his gaze, embarrassed. He said, “Monsieur Derrida, today you talked about ‘negative theology,’ and I think Emil Cioran’s philosophy is a fitting example because …” He carried on, blurting out whatever occurred to him, repeating the name of a philosopher whose work, as he well knew, Derrida had treated with a pointed silence. When he had finished speaking, he lifted his head. Derrida was staring at him with a strange intensity, as if to say, Why are you subjecting me to this nonsensical rant? At last he said: “Your observations are absolutely correct. But I am not familiar with Cioran’s work, so I shall not comment.” 

 

 

By this point Shahid had been talking for a long time, and the mehfil was about to begin. As soon as they sat down, Sabir and Nasim got into their usual disagreement. When Dr. Bukhari heard that Shahid had just returned from Paris, he immediately made an acerbic remark about the decline of France, and a long debate ensued. Sabir, Nasim, and I were speaking in defense of France while Dr. Bukhari continued to oppose it, but Shaukat Ali was quiet, and so was Shahid, watching our verbal jousting with a funny smile playing upon his lips. 

From that day on, he would arrive at five o’clock and sit on the bench outside with us until the hotel closed. The cohort would tease Shahid in a brotherly way, Sabir and Jami having taken to calling him “Derrida da puttar”⁠⁠—Derrida’s boy. During these debates, he would present his views with conviction, but in a civilized, guarded manner, having learned by then to exercise caution. On only one occasion did he disregard the bounds of propriety⁠⁠—when Dr. Bukhari claimed that deconstruction was a mere conspiracy devised by the West to divert Eastern scholars from real issues and problems. He declared that it was the CIA that chiefly benefited from deconstruction, because as long as the finest scholars of our nation remained entangled in that kind of mind game, this Zionist agency could easily enslave our country. He went on to call Derrida one such Zionist agent. At this, Shahid got up and grabbed Dr. Bukhari by the collar until we intervened and demanded that Dr. Bukhari leave. 

The mehfil at Al-Fateh convened daily, and Shahid would attend every day⁠⁠—but I was noticing that his participation in debates and discussions was gradually diminishing, until it finally ceased altogether. As we argued with Dr. Bukhari, he drew long puffs on his cigarette, staring at us all with mournful eyes. One night as he was leaving, I grabbed his arm. “I’ll drive you home,” I said, “but on the way, you have to tell me why you are so troubled.” He hesitated, but as we drove, he confessed that life and failure had become inextricable. He had failed to inspire a passion for philosophy among his students, his deconstructivist articles had been turned down by editors, and his application for a transfer from Govt. College, Sheikhupura, to a college in Lahore, too, had been thwarted by his father. But being separated from Derrida was by far the most excruciating. Going back to Paris was now an impossibility⁠⁠—his father had stopped supporting him, and his meager income could not accommodate a plane ticket. “Will I ever reunite with my murshid? Not in this life, it seems.” His eyes welled up with tears. I assured him, “Sheeday, be strong. I am certain that you will be reunited soon.” And he replied, “Insha’ Allah!” Hearing this, I looked at him in wonder. I’d thought he was an atheist.

 

 

Four months went by, and his agony only intensified. He was often absent, frequenting Al-Fateh just once or twice a week. We were all silent spectators of his grief, until one evening we were surprised to find him bubbling with laughter, a large bottle in his hand. “I’m drinking to celebrate the coming of my murshid, the greatest philosopher in the world, Jacques Derrida, who is arriving in Lahore tomorrow!” (Dr. Bukhari quietly sipped his chai, watching Shahid like a wolf eyeing its prey.) Derrida was to deliver a lecture at FC College, where he would be spending one day and one night. Shahid urged me to come, but I made an excuse. As I dropped him home, though, I made him promise that he would come to Al-Fateh in the evening. 

At the next day’s mehfil, Sabir Chattha read out his latest allegorical piece, and right away Dr. Bukhari began attacking it viciously: “This form you’ve adopted may be acceptable in the West, where they’ll tolerate anything⁠⁠—profanity, drug abuse, sexual deviance⁠⁠—but here we have a different moral code, which you have blatantly flouted, out of sheer ideological ignorance!” From there, it devolved into a debate so heated that, for a long while, no one noticed that Shahid hadn’t shown up. When the owner gruffly announced that the hotel was closing in ten minutes, Nasim Jami turned to me and asked, “Irfan, why wasn’t Shahid here tonight?” I reminded him that Shahid was meeting his murshid. “He must be on his way,” I said, but Jami cut in, exclaiming, “Look, ji! Speak of the devil and the devil appears!” 

There he was, limping along on the road outside the hotel, his clothes dirty and torn. One of his eyes was busted and his nose was bleeding. We were appalled to see him like this. What had happened? We all busied ourselves tending to him. I helped him sit down, and Jami gave him some water from his glass. Sabir wiped off the blood with his handkerchief, Shaukat rubbed his back, and Dr. Bukhari called to the owner to bring more chai⁠⁠—the owner grumbled that the stove would be turned off after this one. Shahid gulped down the water, and the chai arrived. He poured some into the saucer and said, “If any one of you dares call me Derrida da puttar tonight, I will murder you, I swear!” 

He refused to talk at the hotel, so I drove him home. It was only as we made our way through the city streets that I dared ask him to tell me what happened. He agreed, adding, “That way, in the future, you can testify on my behalf.” I asked what he meant, but in truth, I was afraid of his answer, and my conscience still nags at me for my cowardice; when he ignored the question and went on, I listened wordlessly, and didn’t ask again.

That morning, he’d arrived at FC College at ten o’clock. The auditorium had been packed with at least six hundred people⁠⁠—students, faculty, scholars, artists, and journalists⁠⁠—and it took him a long time to find an empty seat. Derrida walked onstage to a burst of applause, puffing on his pipe, and took his seat behind a desk. Shahid’s old philosophy tutor, Sheiz, who had returned from America, was by Derrida’s side. He took the mic and said the usual things about how our guest today needed no introduction⁠⁠—though Shahid suspected that 99 percent of the audience had never even heard of Derrida, and probably none had read him besides himself and Sheiz. Meanwhile, Derrida was taking papers from his bag and strewing them all over the desk. Shahid smiled⁠⁠—his murshid’s habits hadn’t changed. There was the same pipe emitting the same exaggerated spirals of smoke, the same elegant crown of snow-white hair, and, beneath it, the same hawklike eyes. Derrida cleared his throat and repeated, this time in English, the same announcement he had made two years ago at the opening of his seminar.

He revealed the topic of his lecture, “The Witness and Witnessing,” and recited a verse from Paul Celan⁠⁠—“No one / bears witness for the / witness”⁠⁠—before launching into its deconstruction. Within a few moments, the entire auditorium was under Derrida’s spell. He spoke of love⁠⁠—how, when someone says the words I love you, they make the addressee a witness to their emotions. This sentence is simultaneously a claim, a confession, and an oath. For an hour, Derrida explored various lines of inquiry, pursuing one till he reached an aporia, then switching to another⁠⁠—Shahid counted nine distinct lines of argument⁠⁠—until all at once he brought his investigation to a halt: “Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give you an opportunity to ask questions. Thank you for your attention.” The spectators were jolted painfully out of their reverie. Then their applause shook the heavens. Was Derrida enjoying it? It was impossible to tell. His face was expressionless⁠⁠—not a hint of joy or displeasure. In fact, looking closely, one could detect a haze of boredom.

Thanking Derrida for his fascinating lecture, Sheiz addressed the audience: “Does anyone have a question?” But everyone stayed quiet, intimidated. Sheiz announced that if anyone wished to ask a question anonymously, they could write it down. There was an audible sigh of relief, and right away, a scrap of paper made its way into Derrida’s hands. Derrida unfolded it and read the question: “How does deconstruction view Islam?” This question must have come from a member of the religious activist group that had recently vowed to impeach the philosopher⁠⁠—on the very same charges leveled at Shahid back in his college days. Derrida replied, “Look, deconstruction is not the name of an individual who holds a personal opinion and goes around expressing it. Deconstruction is a movement, and rather than offering opinions, it engages with inquiry, analysis, and comparative study. I would advise the author of this question to apply themselves and, before asking these kinds of questions, learn what deconstruction really means.” Shahid sat there, secretly congratulating Derrida⁠⁠—he had put them in their place all right, those people who had made his life such a misery. Thanks to Derrida, he was finally being granted justice.

A heavy silence descended. The audience, faced with this stern response, had lost its nerve. Shahid seized his chance and jotted down a few questions on a piece of paper. When he saw his murshid holding his note, his heart pounded as though it might explode. Derrida read his message slowly, deliberately, enunciating every word: “Dear Jacques Derrida, I belong to a devout feudal family from a small town, but I am also an atheist and a philosopher. My family is pressing me to stay in the past⁠⁠—feudalism, religion⁠⁠—but in recent years I have become affiliated with your school of thought, which inspires me to skepticism and rebellion … dear Jacques Derrida, my being has split in two. Who am I, fundamentally? What am I?” Derrida paused for a moment. Then his face broke into a mischievous smile. 

So, he deemed Shahid’s questions laughable, unworthy of a genuine answer! Following his lead, a grin went around the whole audience, spreading across each face. Shahid wanted to run and hide in a cave. But if he fled, everyone would know that he was the author of this apparently comical question. Meanwhile, another piece of paper had been handed to Derrida. He answered solemnly, and then yet another slip arrived, and that one, too, Derrida recognized as deserving of a serious, comprehensive answer. He kept answering one question after another, but by now Shahid’s thoughts were entirely consumed with why Derrida had chosen to insult him, and how his question could be worthy of such an insult. For Derrida’s sake, he had gone through so much, made so many sacrifices⁠⁠—and this was his reward? 

At 11:57, Sheiz looked at his watch and announced that the lecture was over. Once more, the audience clapped hard for Professor Derrida, who, oblivious to the applause, got up and began nonchalantly stuffing his papers back into his bag. As soon as he set foot off the stage, a dozen people crowded around him, each asking some complicated question, and observing this charade, Shahid wondered where all these people had been hiding when Sheiz had invited questions. Cowardly citizens of a cowardly nation! Anyway, Derrida was surrounded. He kept apologizing that he had no more time. By then Shahid’s thoughts had cleared, and he joined the crowd. He was in agony, desperate to share his grievances. But he had no chance to complain, because all of a sudden a tall white man stepped in and smoothly made his way through the throng. Derrida announced that he had to leave right away with this gentleman, who had been sent by the French ambassador to collect him for a lunch organized in his honor. Then Derrida turned to Sheiz⁠⁠—who, Shahid noticed, was carefully avoiding his gaze⁠⁠—and asked, “You’ll be at Avari to pick me up?” Sheiz replied, “Of course, Mr. Derrida. I will be there at five sharp!” Derrida followed his associate from the embassy outside, and all those who had been waiting with their questions looked stricken.

But Shahid was determined not to give up. He vowed that he would find Derrida that day and confront him with his list of grievances, no matter what. He hailed a rickshaw outside and told the driver to take him to the Avari Hotel. The rickshaw flew through the city streets. He was going to meet him there.

At the reception desk, he inquired about Derrida and was informed that he was still out⁠⁠—no surprise, as he must surely still be with that damned ambassador. Shahid settled on a sofa in the lobby to wait, and since he did not want his second encounter to fail like the first, he started rehearsing. He pulled paper and pen from his pockets and began jotting down everything he wanted to say. He felt utterly despairing, but it was not appropriate to start on that note. He first had to win Derrida’s trust. He decided he would begin by expressing his gratitude for all Derrida had done for him. He wrote, “Monsieur Derrida, I have always thought of you as my murshid because you enlightened me, and gave me the tools to critique and change that part of the third world where I first opened my eyes, that stronghold of ignorance and spite. You gave me faith that I would triumph in this battle and defeat those old, outdated traditions that …” His pen hesitated … this was getting wordy. A busy man like Derrida did not have the time for such a long preamble. His monologue had to be concise, so he shouldn’t delay his grievances, but rather address them in his opening lines. He crossed out the sentences and wrote underneath, “Monsieur Derrida, I owe you a debt of gratitude, but today I am really exasperated with you. You have shamed me in front of hundreds of people. I am a third­-world intellectual. I poured my heart out to you and expressed a dilemma that I have been facing for years, and my problems aren’t much different from those of ordinary academics in this country, because …” Et cetera, et cetera⁠⁠—he kept scrawling furiously for an hour.

When he had drafted a short speech in his notebook and read it two or three times to memorize it, he was ready to talk to Derrida. But where was he? The clock was striking half past two. Suddenly Shahid felt suffocated. He decided to go out for a while to clear his mind. He stepped outside and ran into Zia Sahib⁠⁠—the man who’d introduced him to surrealism at Pak Tea House back in college⁠⁠—who was puffing on his Morvens and popping bitter Motilium pills. They started catching up and were soon so absorbed in conversation that when Shahid’s eyes fell upon his interlocutor’s watch, he saw that it was a quarter to five. Sheiz was coming to pick up Derrida at the Avari in fifteen minutes! He hastily took his leave and reached the hotel at five. And what did he discover there? Derrida, standing outside the gate⁠⁠—alone⁠⁠—puffing on his pipe. Shahid strode toward him, looked into his eyes, and said: “Bonjour, Monsieur Derrida, je m’appelle Shahid Wirk, et je voulais vous dire que⁠⁠—” But just then, a blue car pulled up in front of the gate, with Sheiz in the driver’s seat. Derrida interrupted him, in English: “I am so sorry, but I have to go right now, people are waiting for me at the opening of an exhibition of contemporary art. Goodbye and good luck!”

He got into Sheiz’s car and they drove off. Shahid was left stranded there, flustered. Derrida had slipped through his fingers yet again, and this time it wasn’t a distinguished diplomat but the city’s elites that he was in such a rush to join. God knows what had happened to Derrida in Lahore, what kind of snake had bitten him! In Paris, he would make time for just about any parasite and listen to what they had to say, but here, it seemed, all his time was reserved for the powerful. He was not inclined to sacrifice even five minutes to an unimportant man such as Shahid⁠⁠—but Shahid made up his mind that he would find Derrida at the gallery. There was only one in Lahore that showed contemporary art. He flagged another rickshaw and directed it to Harappa Gallery.

After forty-five minutes they arrived, and when he saw Sheiz’s blue car parked a few feet ahead, he let out a sigh of relief that he had come to the right place. At the door, a bouncer blocked him, asking him to show his invitation. Obviously, Shahid didn’t have one, so he stood outside, watching the beautiful, impeccably dressed people arriving. Their disdainful expressions, extravagant clothes, and luxurious chauffeur-driven cars turned out to be as good as an invitation. Since he had a darker complexion, wore an ordinary shalwar kameez, and had arrived in a rickshaw, he was persona non grata. Yet another humiliation! Today was his day of shame. He asked the bouncer for the time. It was nearly six o’clock and he estimated that Derrida would be at the gallery for at least an hour. He was in no mood to wait outside, so he walked over to the teahouse at the nearby market.

The stoop of the teahouse was long, with a handful of chauffeurs on the steps playing cards as they sipped their chai⁠⁠—if that was the name for the foul, stale liquid Shahid was served. As he drank he began meditating on all the failures that were dogging him lately. Not too long ago, he had thought to seek political asylum in Norway or Sweden. He had sent applications to their embassies, writing that he was an atheist philosopher and that, due to his intellectual leanings, his life was perpetually in danger. But he was told he could apply only if he traveled to the country in question⁠⁠—and, more dismaying, that his case was unlikely to be accepted⁠⁠—and now it seemed he would fail yet again. 

He sat there for an entire hour, and when it was seven o’clock, he got up and gave a few coins to the tea boy before walking back to the gallery. Night was falling and the bouncer was no longer at the gate, but Shahid didn’t have the nerve to crash the party. He peeked inside to see the festivities in full swing, attended by every important aristocrat in the city. Derrida’s face stood out in this crowd of bourgeois faces. He held a drink in one hand, a local beauty in tight jeans and a clingy T-shirt by his side. Derrida looked thrilled! Shahid found the sight revolting, and couldn’t stand it for long. He turned away and leaned against a lamppost. 

After some time, Derrida emerged, quick as an arrow, with Sheiz running behind him. Both jumped into the car and it sped off. There was nothing to do but chase him. An empty rickshaw came by and Shahid leaped inside, instructing the driver to follow that blue car. Suddenly, he had transformed into the hero of a detective novel, in hot pursuit of two coconspirators. They went past Model Town, driving through roads shrouded in darkness, and arrived in a deserted suburban area surrounded by woods. But the blue car had vanished. He was too late, and Derrida had escaped, for the fourth time today!

Finally, he returned to the Avari. He was certain Derrida would be there⁠⁠—it was getting very late now, and he had a flight to catch the next morning. Shahid stepped into the lobby and looked around. Kismet seemed to be on his side. Derrida was sitting on a long couch, alone, puffing his customary pipe. Shahid started advancing in his direction, and he was almost there when he noticed a short woman seated on a couch in front of Derrida, a notebook open on her lap. She was saying, “Sir, we hope to run this in our next issue. With your permission, I’ll ask you just a few questions …” So this woman was a journalist. It was not appropriate to interrupt. He would have to be patient. He walked farther down and took a seat on another couch. Derrida was speaking quite loudly, and Shahid could hear every word: “I have to wake up early. I will only answer two or three questions.” The journalist nodded, feigning sympathy. “Sure, sir, I’ll keep it short. Dr. Derrida, how much room do we have for deconstruction in our country? And what shades of color might deconstruction take on here?” What remarkably foolish question! Why couldn’t deconstruction be applied here? He expected Derrida to get frustrated with the absurd little creature and give her a piece of his mind, but he was wrong. Derrida rewarded her with a reasonable answer: “Look, to answer this question, first I’ll have to explain what deconstruction is, and that is very difficult for me because it is impossible to define it. Therefore, I can only tell you what deconstruction is not. Deconstruction is not a philosophical disposition, nor is it an ideology. It is also not a practice, because deconstruction is not done, it simply occurs. Occurs on its own. What is deconstruction? Nothing! And what is it not? Everything! That is why it can thrive anywhere in any land, and take on any shape and form.” The lady took some notes and moved on: “Dr. Derrida, is it possible to deconstruct Islam?” My God! What kind of question was that? It reminded Shahid of the question that religious fanatic had asked at FC. Once again, he expected Derrida to give a short, brusque answer, but very gently and patiently, he started explaining, “See, if by Islam you mean a system of beliefs and teachings according to which …” 

Shahid couldn’t believe his ears! The man indulging this harebrained woman could not be the real Jacques Derrida. The real Jacques Derrida was somewhere else, and this impostor, who had no qualms about seeking the approval of fools, aristocrats, and statesmen, and no misgivings about humiliating his own followers, had taken his place. Shahid could stay silent no longer. He rose and leaped toward the fake Derrida, yelling “Fake Derrida, you bastard, haramda!” and struck the impostor hard. 

Two men from the hotel’s security detail grabbed Shahid from behind. They dragged him to a corner and dealt him a few heavy blows, then called the police, who came and took him away. At the station, they beat him up for half an hour⁠⁠—a so-called investigation⁠⁠—until the phone rang. The manager of the Avari had called to tell him that the elderly white gentleman Shahid had attacked did not wish to press charges, nor did he have any comments to make on the matter. Shahid left the police station, caught the bus to Sheikhupura, and headed to Al-Fateh.

Our ride had come to its end. With his hand wrapped around the car door handle, Shahid said, in a miserable voice, “Irfan, remember how I told you about that guy Bertin, who used to provoke Derrida at every seminar? I regret despising him now. He was right. Derrida deserved it. I should have become a follower of Bertin’s instead. Anyway, goodbye.” The door opened and he got out. His dejected form evanesced into the darkness. 

 

 

The evening after I drove him home, his father invited me over. He told me that Shahid had left and had not returned. He wanted to know about his state the previous night. I lied and said that he’d seemed perfectly fine⁠⁠—I’ve never cared much for his father. Then he asked me for a favor. Could I search his room? I might recover some clue⁠⁠—a fragment, letter, or note⁠⁠—that could lead us to him. I agreed, because I had always been curious to see inside. 

The room was exactly as I had envisioned it⁠⁠—a shrine. The desk and the closet were lined with Derrida’s books, the walls emblazoned with quotations in chalk, and on the wall facing the desk hung a huge picture of Derrida, who looked quite mad, as if he might strike whoever dared look at him. Each time Shahid sat at his desk, his murshid’s gaze must have fallen on him, Derrida’s burning eyes fueling his toil. Then I saw that across the bottom of the picture Shahid had scrawled the word impostor. On the desk, a copy of Derrida’s The Post Card lay open. My eyes fell on a few sentences underlined in red. “But I will arrive, I will arrive at the point where you will no longer read me,” the passage began. “Not only by becoming more illegible than ever for you (it’s beginning, it’s beginning), but by doing things such that you no longer even recall that I am writing for you …” I informed his father that I hadn’t found anything⁠⁠—no letter, no note⁠⁠—and took my leave. 

Two weeks went by and Shahid never came home. He was the subject of every mehfil at Al-Fateh. Everyone had a different theory about his disappearance. Sabir thought he had become a dervish. Jami wondered if he had gone back to Paris. Shaukat insisted that he had become a radical overnight and moved to Kashmir for jihad. All three firmly believed he was alive, but Bukhari Sahib’s opinion differed. He was convinced that Shahid had left home with the intent to commit suicide, and he often said, “I told him many times not to get mixed up with these white Zionist philosophers, they are dangerous. But he didn’t listen. The result is before us.” 

Shahid’s father searched everywhere for his son, scouring morgues, hospitals, mosques, police stations. He posted missing-person flyers all around town, promising a reward to anyone with information as to his whereabouts. At last, Malik Aslam turned to a famous soothsayer from Gujranwala. The soothsayer apologized. He was unable to find any trace of his son between the heavens and earth. 

All this was twenty years ago, and Shahid is still missing. How things have changed! It is a different world. His beloved Derrida is dead, his father now bedbound. Soon after his disappearance, Sabir and Jami had a falling-out, Shaukat’s newspaper shuttered, and, a year after my marriage, my twins were born. The mehfils at Al-Fateh, my only entertainment, petered out. Sometimes I suspect I am the only one to remember those long evenings, let alone Shahid and his strange disappearance. People don’t ask about him anymore. They don’t even utter his name. He’s been erased⁠⁠—perhaps that’s what he wanted. To this day, I regret that I watched him walk away. 

May the Lord forgive the man, he was singular and free.

    "text": "My father answers the phone. He is twenty-three years old, and, as everyone does in the nineties, he picks up the receiver without knowing who is calling. People call all day long, and my parents pick up and say, “Hello?” and then people say, “It’s Carmen,” or “I’m calling from the post office,” or “I’d like to confirm your appointment.” But at night, if the phone rings and my father picks up, nobody answers. He waits with the receiver to his ear until he gets tired of standing there doing nothing, or asking questions into the void, or sometimes even cursing. He lowers the receiver onto its base, and though the mechanical click puts an end to the silence, he knows there is something more. 

It’s a time when few household appliances can function without cords. Lithium is an imperceptible element hidden inside their batteries—the batteries hidden in turn inside little plastic compartments—silently beating in hundreds and thousands of metal hearts to which no one pays much attention, and, hidden from view, in that neighborhood in El Bolsón, Argentina, and in all the cities of the world, this new energy seems like a simple miracle. 

To keep the phone from ringing, my father unplugs the cord that connects it to the wall before he puts me to bed. Everyone pays close attention to my sleep—my parents, my grandparents, the doctors, the woman who sometimes comes to clean. Sleep can be dangerous. It numbs still-weak muscles, tendons that never healed. “Did the boy sleep well?” they all ask.

The calls are for my father only. If Mom answers, the caller immediately hangs up. But my father, a salesman whose job consists above all of reading the things on people’s faces that people don’t know are written there, is greeted by faceless silence, and stands listening with the receiver to his ear for a long time, terrified by his own disquiet.




Eight months before the calls begin, I am almost two years old, sitting in front of a Grundig TV in my paternal grandmother’s living room. When I get distracted, I crawl and toddle around, investigating every object that lies in my path, everything at my fingertips. To whomever is taking care of me, my mother says, “Please pay attention.” She says it even to my father that afternoon, before she drops us off at Grandma’s house for a couple of hours. Cartoons are on in the living room, but the pixels on the screen entertain me only sporadically. My father is vigilant; he looks over from the dining room table to check on me. He talks to Grandma but keeps watch over my movements, my constant conversation with the things around me. 

If objects don’t clearly express their purpose, I suck them, bite them, bang them against each other. The slippers against the remote control, the remote control against the calculator on the shelf; my grandmother’s watch into my mouth, and then, before I leave it on the floor, I hit it a couple of times against the slippers. I am soothed by the objects whose purpose I can identify. The Russian dolls on the lowest shelf come apart, they go one inside the other and close up again. It’s complicated, fitting the pieces together, but there is a kind of urge toward completeness in those shapes that can split in two that fascinates me even more than the digital numbers on the calculator or the coarse granules of the Grundig screen.

All it takes is a long silence for my father to turn around. Sitting in front of the TV, surrounded by objects scattered about the floor, I stare back at him in fear. He stands up and rushes over to me, because what is happening is not a tantrum—that’s something he understands right away. This is not the silence that precedes a crying fit. He has seen my cheeks puffed out and turning red, but it takes him a few seconds to understand that I can’t breathe. I clench one of my little hands into a fist and clumsily hit at my mouth.

 “What did you do?” he asks.

He tries to open my fist, my mouth. I slip away, he catches me. He forces my fingers open. Suddenly I swallow, I swallow something, and my father looks at me in terror.

“What is that? What did you swallow?” he shouts.

My eyes fill with tears. 

“What did you swallow?” 

“Nothing,” I say, and my voice is so sweet it sounds sincere. 

My voice is a memory that interrupts everything each time it comes back to me. Action and consequence, scene after scene, my father and I will remember everything from this moment on with the sharpness of an alarm that neither of us will ever be able to turn off again. I say “Nothing” and I’m moved by the miracle of my tongue touching my upper palate, the air rushing down my windpipe into my lungs, and the vibration of my vocal cords. 

My father grabs me and I let him; I still trust him. He opens my mouth, wanting to believe there is nothing. 

“Tell me the truth, it’s important,” he says. “Did you swallow something?”

I shake my head.

“You didn’t swallow anything?”

It seems like a different question, but I catch on to the trick and give the same reply. 

In this era when, in El Bolsón and all the cities of the world, almost every household thing that runs on electricity is connected to the wall by a cord, we have to wait for Mom to return before we can hear her opinion. In the meantime, my father thinks, He’s okay, he’s okay—a silent mantra pounding at his temple. Exhausted from imagining the worst, he is reassured to see I am soon distracted again, to see how I play and laugh and accept the tangerine wedge he sets in front of me, how I put it in my mouth and swallow with no trouble.

Except that in the evening, back at home and after dinner, I start to cough. Later, I wake up retching, and just in case, they take me to the emergency room. A doctor listens to my chest. “Everything seems fine,” he says, looking at me kindly. “Come back tomorrow if there are any symptoms.” He pinches my cheek. “Or the day after tomorrow, if nothing comes out in his stool but he’s still retching,” he adds, already at his office door, scanning the waiting room for his next patient.

Mom conscientiously crushes each bowel movement with a fork. She examines me as she saw the doctor do, but with her ears instead of a stethoscope. I squeal with delight at the tickle of that cold ear on my belly, chest, and back, but between peals of laughter I’m still coughing. Mom, who has learned that taking care of someone means understanding what to do and why, listens and listens and doesn’t know what she’s listening for. She gets restless. She needs a second opinion, and books an appointment with the family doctor for the next day.

In the morning, I wake up without a voice and with a slight fever, and in the afternoon my breathing trouble starts. Mom calls the hospital, and this time the doctors are alarmed. I vomit in the waiting room and am whisked straight to radiology. A doctor speaks with my mother privately, hanging the X-ray on a luminous box. The film is a dense black that faintly shows the thoracic bones and the shadows of some organs. In the center, suspended between my clavicles and just below my throat, is a perfect white circle so full of light that the box’s lamp seems to pulsate through it. 

After dropping Mom and me at home again, my father goes to Grandma’s house and checks all the objects I had been playing with, the image of the circle clear in his mind. He opens and closes the digital clock on the end table, opens and closes the battery compartment of the Grundig remote control, opens but doesn’t close the digital calculator’s small black cover. “How did you know it wasn’t working?” asks my grandmother, who quickly understands why her son is looking at her but can’t answer.

A surgery to remove the button battery is scheduled for the next day, seventy-five miles from El Bolsón, in Bariloche. We set out at dawn so as to be at the hospital first thing in the morning. Once I’m checked in, there’s a moment when I am left alone. The charge nurse has noticed that my medical charts are missing and she goes back to get them. It might be the first time I’ve ever been by myself in a place that isn’t my bedroom or my grandmother’s. I am lying on a gurney in the surgical department hallway. I’m not scared. I look up at the fluorescent light, spectacularly long and flickering. I am aware that I have hardly spoken for a few days now, but what do I know about what is normal and what is not? Yesterday, a guy on TV said that there are false teeth that have to fall out so the real ones can come in; maybe you also have to stop talking before the first adult words come in. Maybe every child my age passes or has passed through a similar hallway, and the overhead light is doing something to my body. Maybe, as the doctors say, we just have to wait.

 An anesthesiologist puts me to sleep, and a surgeon and two assistants perform an endoscopy to remove the battery. The lithium, hidden inside its metal heart, has been activated by the body’s internal moisture, and has perforated the esophagus with a deep, dark burn. The vocal cords are damaged, and reflux has caused lesions. I am intubated and spend three days in intensive care. The doctors discuss the possibility of damage to organ linings near the esophagus. Mom paces from one side of my bed to the other. She can’t sit down, can’t think. The doctors decide to perform a tracheotomy. I wake up six hours later and my hands go straight for my throat, though the part that itches so bad is a little farther down. I feel around for it, fumbling, and my fingers meet plastic. An open protrusion that is now a part of my body. The doctors ask for our patience and give us referrals. Once we’re back home, we’ll have to schedule the next procedure with a specialist in Buenos Aires. 

It’s too late. No one says it, but everyone knows. Just when kids my age are starting to play with more complex words, to discover the power of tone and the luxury of intentional silences, I lose the few words I had learned. I don’t cry, I’m not afraid; there are still many things that fill me with wonder and curiosity. I like to be bathed. I like when my father sits on the little stool Mom has assigned him and holds me over the water to teach me to float. I haven’t done it yet, but I keep trying, inflating my belly with air. All he has to do is hold me up with the palms of his hands and then dare to let go.

He can’t: my father has changed. He avoids my eyes, his frowning gaze focused on the plastic protrusion. I have to keep the water out, thinks my father, here in the bathroom but also at the office in the morning, and at the grocery store on the way home, and in the car when he’s pulling up to the house: I have to keep the water out. He holds my body on his palms and avoids my eyes that say, Please, please, please. I want him to release me, and he doesn’t know how to let me go—a break in the circuit that is also connected to his embrace. He can’t let go of me, but neither can he hold me. I’m the same size as a week ago, but now something in his hugs is misaligned. What’s wrong, Dad? What’s wrong, what’s wrong? I want to know, but my throat can’t carry the question because it’s too open. You have to be able to squeeze the air to turn the silence into something, to push the inside out, but what is inside and what is out for me? In any case, the problem is not that I can’t speak; the problem is that if I don’t speak, he won’t look at me. 

Mom realizes what’s happening, or what is no longer happening, between me and my father. But what can she do? From the start, from the moment I let go of the walls and ventured to walk on my own, I have been running toward him. I seek out the madness of the intense pleasure that comes from him holding me upside down by one foot, all the energy of his hand embracing my ankle or attacking my ribs with his fingers; or, with his lips pressed to my chest, growling so loud that the vibration of his vocal cords makes me tremble inside. And a moment before that, the mutual theatrics when my father finds me in my mother’s arms or hugging her legs and looks at me angrily, offended. And I scream with pleasure and think, It’s starting! It’s going to happen! Then he lets go of whatever he has in his hands, drops it all to the floor, and crouches down with open arms. He has trained me in my desperation to run to him.  

Mom is hurt by my preference for him, but everything that makes me happy makes my mother happy, too, just as everything that hurts me hardens her. So now that my father’s arms have short-circuited, Mom tries to talk to him. “What’s going on?” she says, sitting on the bed at night. “Where are you?” she asks stiffly, her hand kneading a crick in her neck. She walks like that in the morning, too, while she makes breakfast. With her fingers on her neck and her elbow pointing to the sky like an antenna, she looks like a doll hanging from her own hand. She will walk that way all summer, by late spring she will have learned to ignore the pain, and in winter she will drop both arms to her sides, hands busy enough that her resignation never shows.




Nearly eight months later, I’m nodding off in my car seat. My thirty-one pounds and five ounces are crossing the desert toward Buenos Aires at seventy-five miles per hour. My father is driving. He’s tired and the trip is just getting started. Mom gazes out at the sepia landscape. She feels untroubled in the car. Any enclosed space she has minutely inspected is innocuous, a threat-free zone. 

The third operation is performed at the Italian Hospital in Buenos Aires. Of all the times I will be exposed to the operating room—four in total during my first six years of life—this is the last one for which my parents hold out any hope. They still believe that a young body will eventually be able to repair itself. 

They rent a hotel room two blocks from the hospital, resting in shifts so that someone is always with me. I am still carefree because I find joy in anything new, and I’m oblivious to the consequences of this shared, escalating disaster. I make noises instead of pronouncing words, I notice every detail of my parents’ body language and copy it all with devout precision. 

“Understand?” my father sometimes asks, sitting next to my bed. He doesn’t look at me when he asks, and he doesn’t expect a reply. He reads aloud children’s books, the newspaper, magazine articles. Sometimes he falls silent or asleep. When he does look at me, I laugh. When he talks to me, I laugh—Love me, love me, love me. I need to say, I’m fine, what’s wrong with you? Where are you? but since I can’t speak, I contort my body, my face. He doesn’t know the body language I’m learning, and the noises I make through the tracheostomy disturb him. When he wakes up and his head jolts upright, it seems not like he’s just returned from somewhere but instead like he can’t believe he is still in the same place. I laugh, and my good humor is another torment to him. 

As soon as we’re discharged, we head back toward El Bolsón. It’s a long trip that we’ve taken before; we cross La Pampa every summer to visit my maternal grandparents in La Plata. My father drives the 1,055 miles, planning to make only one stop to sleep for a few hours and have breakfast. No matter what, we have to fill up at the gas station in General Acha, because in the nineties, besides the fact that almost all appliances have cords, gas doesn’t get you very far, and it’s the last station until Neuquén. 

A little while before we reach General Acha, I start to yawn. For my parents, this isn’t just any occurrence, it’s a magical thing. Sure, I am capable of falling asleep in the car, and in fact I can sleep for hours, but there’s something about the engine’s purr that unsettles rather than relaxes me, and I have trouble giving in. Then Mom does something she loves to do: she climbs into the back beside my car seat, takes me out, and lays me on her lap. My father used to say, “That’s dangerous.” He’d say it once, then again, until she fastened me back up. But apparently he no longer knows what is dangerous and what isn’t. And since no one objects, she stays where she is and puts my yellow blanket over us both. I toss and turn and it seems I’m about to wake up. My mother feels her own exhaustion like a yoke, so heavy it competes with her protective instinct. But she holds on, hugs me, and somewhere along this endless stretch of Route 152—“Oh, miracle at last”—I fall deeply asleep. 

Night has fallen by the time we reach the service station, and there’s a line for the pumps. It’s a Friday in the busy season, and amid the noise of car doors opening and closing, people talking and shouting, my parents do what they can to keep me from waking. Very slowly, Mom moves out from under me, lays me down on the back seat, and covers me with my yellow blanket. 

She leans forward and whispers, “You want some coffee?” 

My father turns and looks at her. He gazes at the hair falling long and loose over her chest. After this trip she will always wear it short, and she’ll stop sharing a bed with him, sleeping instead on a mattress on the floor of my room. My father is so tired that he is slow to answer.  

“Coffee it is, then,” whispers Mom. 

She carefully gets out of the car, and my father watches her walk away until the honk of a horn lets him know it’s his turn. He tells himself, All you have to do is start the car and move it to the pumps. What he feels is not physical exhaustion, but something darker and more menacing. 

A big, tall man moves between the pumps, collecting money. Some months later, searching for information, my father will learn from a local newspaper article that he is forty-six years old, that his last name is Morris, and that he inherited this YPF station unexpectedly from a father he didn’t know he still had. It’s an instinct, Morris is quoted as saying in the article: You sense which zone will complete its cycle first and turn your attention there. If he focuses on the pumps during rush hour, at night he leaves the station in his wife’s hands and instead turns to selling lottery tickets. Pumps or colored cards, doesn’t matter where the money comes from, it’s always about the same things: being ready and paying attention. Two things people often get confused, he clarifies, but that are not the same.

“That’ll be twenty-seven pesos,” Morris says.

He hangs up the nozzle and stares at my father, who rummages through his pockets, sensing the man’s impatience. The money must be in his pants or his coat, or else in his shirt pocket. He checks in on his tiredness and tells himself, And now all you have to do is find the money. Eventually, he gets back in the car to look for his wallet in the driver’s-side door, in the glove compartment, in his bag. He finds it between the front seats. Morris is waiting for him with arms crossed. He glances to either side, monitoring the other pumps, and his voice changes. 

“You like for there to be gas, right?” 

My father doesn’t understand what the question is getting at. 

“Well, I like it when I come to collect and you have the money ready,” says Morris, and my father sees that he is chewing something, though it doesn’t look like gum. “Why am I always the one who has to wait for you?” 

My father is taken aback. Has this happened before? Maybe on the way to Buenos Aires? Does this man remember him? Or maybe it’s the son with the tracheostomy he remembers? My father takes a couple of steps forward to hand him the money and turns away without a word. 

Mom isn’t back yet, so my father parks beside the line of poplar trees and gets out to smoke, watching Morris moving quickly from car to car. There are employees who help him with the pumps, but as soon as it’s someone’s turn to pay, Morris approaches them in silence with his brow furrowed. It’s the customers who have to say hello, thanks very much, and goodbye. Morris just takes the money and nods. 

My father leans against the car and looks around for Mom. I’m asleep on the other side of the glass, stretched out on the back seat, all wrapped up and almost entirely hidden. My mother seems to have carefully pulled aside the blanket where the tracheostomy is—nothing must interrupt my breathing—but she’s covered my eyes so the light won’t bother me. Only my nose peeks out, and that’s what my father finds endearing. He observes me closely, and eventually he thinks of my name with the same intensity as he did on the day they chose it: Elías. Eli. El. He thinks that I have his mother’s nose, and he remembers how I scrunch it up, so often, all the time, and it’s the signal I’m about to start laughing. He thinks about that and he has to make a great effort not to cry. 

When Mom comes back, he decides to go to the bathroom. 

“Your coffee will get cold,” she says as he walks away. 

My father passes Morris, who is coming out of the café counting money and doesn’t see him. He tries to take as little time as possible, because that’s how my father does everything now: dis­tractedly but without wasting time, never lingering. As he pees, he reads a message someone has written in red on the tiles above the urinal: PLEASE CALL. He reads the number over and over and over again, and then he stands in front of a sink at the long Formica counter, looking at himself in the mirror. For a moment, he is thrown off. Am I crazy? he wonders, because Mom’s voice echoes through the bathroom. It says, “Excuse me, is there any toilet paper?” But it’s only his mind running too slowly. Her voice is coming from the other side of the mirror, and another woman answers right away, “Yes, sure, here you go.” Now that he knows she isn’t waiting for him, my father turns on the tap, puts his hands under the water, and surrenders to its flow. He closes his eyes for a few seconds. He can feel a darkness enveloping him, as if he were standing at the bottom of a tank, the water rising faster than he can process. He has to pull his hands out of the water before he is able to open his eyes. Then he turns off the tap and leaves.

My parents wait for each other by the bathroom doors—perhaps it’s the last time they ever wait for each other. Really, it’s my father who waits. As he stands by the women’s bathroom, he looks at the poplars and wonders for a moment if she really left me alone in the car. Then she comes out, and they walk in silence. My father opens his door, trying not to make any noise. When he sees my mother start to get in the back instead of the passenger seat, he clicks his tongue and whispers, “Leave him be.” He wants to prolong the miracle of my sleep. “Come up front.”

Mom knows he is right. She hesitates but concedes, and slowly opens the passenger door, sits down, closes it slowly, then checks on me in the rearview mirror. She pictures me curled up under the yellow blanket and wonders if it’s safe to let me sleep like that. What if the fabric is too tight around the tracheostomy? But she would hear me move—she knows every nuance of my breathing. Silence is the best sign, and she enjoys it, especially at night. When my father closes his door, the light turns off and the yellow blanket darkens. He starts the car and we are back on the road. They drink their coffee, listen to the news with the volume down low and whisper indignant comments. And then, after a long, very long, time in silence, and for the first time on this trip, my mother finally gives in: she falls asleep.

In a few years, some government office in Buenos Aires Province will order the removal of the immense sculptures installed every sixty miles on either side of the road, seven of them along that straight, endless stretch: ruined cars atop tall metal beams, so twisted and mangled they are almost unrecognizable. The last names of the families who once drove them are written in white on blue plaques below, with the number of fatalities and a warning in red: DON’T FALL ASLEEP! The accident prevention campaign is still in effect in the nineties, and although my father doesn’t slow down, he does turn the radio on again. Every once in a while, he checks on me in the rearview mirror. From that angle he can’t see the tip of my nose, but it’s enough just to remember it. He holds the wheel with one hand, and after a while switches to the other. Sometimes he sighs, deeply. 

Mom wakes up at the intersection with Route 24, almost an hour later. It takes a few seconds for the fogginess of sleep to dissipate, and she asks my father if he’s tired. To make conversation, he tells her what the man at the YPF had said to him. 

“Weird, right? That he would remember me . . .”

Mom doesn’t answer; she’s looking in the rearview mirror. Between one millisecond and the next, she has stopped breathing. She jumps, lunges toward the back seat. My father tries to comprehend what is happening, but a truck is barreling toward him and he can’t take his eyes off the road. He hears her scream, and from the corner of his eye he sees my yellow blanket fly violently through the air. Mom tries to say something between choked cries. She spits it out: “He’s not here!”

My father slams on the brakes, pulls off to the side of the road. A car passes at full speed, horn blaring. 

“He’s not here!” screams Mom. “He’s not here!”

“What do you mean he’s not here?” my father asks, because what she is saying makes no sense, or is too difficult to imagine, and now she’s hitting him with her fists. He brings the car to a full stop and turns around. I’m not there. I’m no longer there. I have disappeared. 

The blanket is there, and there’s Mom getting out of the car, but me, where am I? My father gets out, too, and checks the back seat. Outside, Mom looks up and down the highway, yanking at fistfuls of her hair as if something immense had gotten inside her head and were about to break it open.  

My father yells, “You didn’t lock the car when you went to the bathroom?”

Mom doesn’t seem to be in any condition to answer. He starts the car without waiting for her to get back in, makes a U-turn, and somehow now she’s inside, now she’s putting on her seat belt. Everything that happens now happens like that, chaotic and jumpy, and at the same time with exasperating slowness. They drive back to the YPF at top speed in a car that seems to be standing still.

It’s strange to not be there. I am nothing of what remains—not the back seat, not the yellow blanket, not my empty car seat—though there is something of me in everything that has been mine. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me, I say to my father. He grips the steering wheel, thinking about his hands under the cold water in the bathroom, about my nose that looks so much like his mother’s, about his own voice when he asked me, “Did you swallow something?” and about my voice, soft as the line of fog over the valley of the desert highway: Nothing. 

A car goes by in the opposite direction, its driver talking on one of those giant black Movicom phones that executives are starting to carry around with them. It takes Mom several seconds to compute that she could have flagged him down, tried to stop the car and call the YPF, or the police, though the police are even farther away from that YPF than my parents are. And how would they get the gas station’s number? Everything is revealed to her disproportionately slowly, though she has never been so alert. 

“Shit,” says Mom, “shit,” and she starts to cry. And a while later still she says, “He could be on the road,” and she stares at my father, seeming to shut down. 

My father is too frightened to say a word—he doesn’t take his eyes off the road or his hands off the wheel—but Mom seems to have come to a realization, and her system lights up again. “He can’t talk. That’s what is happening: my son is alone, and he can’t talk.”

And me? From where am I watching them? Whatever has happened to me, it has turned me into something else. It has disarmed and expanded me, enlarged me. It is a terribly painful thing, yet I am outside of my body. 

When they finally see the YPF, Mom is so overcome that she moans, clutching the door handle. They screech into the station, tires bouncing over the curb, and park haphazardly in front of the café. The car stops and she’s already running inside. My father turns off the engine, gets out, and looks intently around him: the parking lot, the poplar trees and rest area, the nearby highway. People have stopped what they were doing to look at him. Morris is walking toward him, perhaps to chastise him again, but my father doesn’t have time for that, and he goes inside as well.

There are customers eating at the tables and others browsing the shelves, but he doesn’t see Mom. A lady sitting with her children points to the counter and the door behind it that says PRIVATE. He rushes toward it, pushes it open, crosses a dark hallway filled with boxes and merchandise. Mom’s screams reach him as though from the depths of a cave, and my father realizes that he might faint, that there is a possibility, an unacceptable possibility, that he won’t make it to the other end of the hallway.

And then Mom yells, “Who found him?” and my father breathes again. “Where was he?” Mom shouts, and my father lets go of the wall. He’s almost there, almost to the other end. I’m in Mom’s arms, I’m hugging her, hiding my face in her armpit. The woman receiving Mom’s shouts is nodding in silence. She looks weary, as if she has already tried to respond several times and has finally given up. My father is there now, he’s here, I can hear him breathing. We’re in the living room of a house connected to the back of the gas station. On the floor there is a pile of wooden blocks the woman has been using to try to entertain me. 

“Who was with my son all this time?” Mom wants to stop yelling because she needs to start breathing again, but she can’t. She holds me so tight it’s as if she believes I’m capable of holding her up. 

My father knows that if he bends down and reaches out toward me, I will let go and run to him. He knows the pain that will cause Mom at a moment like this. I know it, he knows it, she knows it. And yet he bends his knees, gets closer to the floor. He looks at me, calls to me, says my name. The vibration of his vocal cords makes my spine quiver. I tell myself, Don’t move. I say, No, no, no. I talk to myself so as not to listen to him. Hiding my face in Mom’s chest, I put my finger into the valve and touch inside. I feel nothing, I’m no longer there. If it’s not me I’m touching, it must be one of them. But Mom is here, on my outside, my eyelids pressed against her blouse. So is it my father I touch?

My father holds out his arms, despite the price to be paid. But I don’t let go. My father’s voice calls to me again. Mom hugs me. Everything that hurts me hardens my mother, but there is something in my rejection that unites my parents in a single fear. The child has never rejected his father before. What happened? 

“I already told the lady here”—the woman is talking to my father—“someone brought the boy to the café.” 

“But where was he?” my mother asks. 

The woman doesn’t know, she didn’t ask, should she have asked? 

“We waited awhile, didn’t we, sweetie?” The woman comes closer, leans over, seeking me out, and Mom pulls me away. “And since he has that little problem,” says the woman, stretching the skin of her neck, “we couldn’t really talk, isn’t that right, honey? So we called the police, just in case. And I must say, they were very nice, weren’t they now?” The woman looks at me as if I really were following her words, then she looks at my mother. “They said they would come by as soon as they finished their rounds, and that’ll be a while yet. Would you like a little something to drink?” 

Then Morris comes into the room, and my father immediately stands up. Morris is holding a roll of bills and crosses the living room without looking at anyone. He takes a small lockbox from the shelf, opens it, and puts the money inside.

“We feeling better?” he asks, his back still turned. 

He closes the box and returns it to the shelf and only then does he look at my father. He’s chewing on something, what is he chewing?

“See how fast I always give you what you ask for?” 

What happens next is something my father will think about over and over for years.

“Come with me,” says Morris. 

My father glances at Mom and then walks away, following him. They cross the long hallway to the café and come out again by the counter. On the other side, between the counter and the first row of tables, there is a pay phone attached to the wall. Morris takes a token from his pocket and dials a number from memory. His big and battered hand holds the plastic receiver against his ear, and he waits. 

“YPF here,” he says, and stares at my father. 

He says his name into the telephone, and after a brief silence he bursts out laughing, as if someone on the other end had told a joke. He talks distractedly while he studies my father, looking over his face, his clothes, his hands. 

“Yeah, who can say,” he mutters into the phone. “You know how people are these days.” He nods. “Yes, officer, of course.” 

He gives a slight raise of his chin to summon my father. Morris smells of gasoline and tobacco; he hands off the phone and takes a few steps back. My father answers some questions, gives my full name and his own, his contact information, including the phone number for our house in El Bolsón. When he hangs up, Morris is no longer in the café. 

The first night back home, when he’s lying in bed on the verge of sleep, my father is startled by the sound of the phone ringing in the living room. He gets up to answer, and for the first time hears the cold, dark silence that will confound him for years to come.
And there are several nights that follow when he keeps on getting up to answer. Because someone could be calling from Buenos Aires with the latest information about my case—at the Italian Hospital, the most critical news had always come in the early morning. He answers, he always answers, even though no one replies. “Hello,” he says. “Hello!” And it takes him a while to resign himself and hang up. 




Before my bath, in the days after our return from Buenos Aires, my father checks my body meticulously, including under my arms and between my legs. He even makes me open my mouth. He doesn’t know what he’s looking for, but he finds nothing. He lowers me into the tub, making sure not a single drop of water enters the tracheostomy. He wets my hair slowly, shampoos me while keeping an eye on the lather, which must drip only down the back of my head, and takes that chance to check my scalp. 

“They had some nice wooden blocks, huh? At the YPF . . .” he says, as though distracted. I concentrate on my knees. Mom thinks something happened to me at the YPF when they weren’t there, that I’m not the same as before. My father reproaches her, saying I’m just tired, but that’s what my father says, not what he thinks. He holds me by the shoulders, turns me toward him, kneels beside me. 

“And how about the woman? Was she nice to you?” 

I nod. My father likes to hold me that way, to see that my shoulder blades are still small enough to fit in the palms of his hands. 

“And the man? Was the man nice to you too?” I nod again, looking at the soap suds bubbling up around my knees. “Did something happen?” 

We wait a moment. 

“Son,” says my father. My father says son. “Did someone hurt you?” 

I’m furious, just like that, suddenly. I am a metal spring that has just escaped a mattress. I look at him because I can’t help it. What is he trying to find out?

“No?” says my father. “Nothing?”

Is he answering himself? Is he answering for me? Is it something he’s pleading for, or something he is stating?

“You would tell me if someone hurt you? Right?” 

I am telling him. Doesn’t he see it? Isn’t it my father’s job to read on people’s faces what people don’t know is written there? What is it that he doesn’t see? What is it that he doesn’t hear? 

Then I pull away, I wriggle out of his hands. If he doesn’t see me, if he can’t hear me, what good are his hands holding me in the water? He looks at me, surprised, and I grab onto the edge of the tub, holding myself with a strength I didn’t know I had, and suddenly I realize I have made the decision not to give this weight to my father ever again. 

Late at night, when the phone rings again, my father whispers into the receiver with clenched teeth. “Son of a bitch,” he says, and “I’ll kill you.” He thinks about Morris recognizing me on the highway, carrying me to the café, leaving me in the woman’s care. But first, thinks my father, between the moment when Morris finds me and the moment he hands me over, what happens? 

“See how fast I always give you what you ask for?”

My father remembers the way Morris asked the question, his tone of voice. Is that why he never answers on the phone? Because my father would recognize him? 

After a few days, my father starts to disconnect the phone from the wall before going to bed and to plug it in again in the morning. During the day, when my father isn’t home, the calls never come.

Once the communications from the different doctor’s offices in Buenos Aires have ceased, Mom drags the old mattress to my bedside and permanently moves into my room. A week later she takes her clothes, too, and the room that had been theirs becomes my father’s. 

Now that he is alone, insomnia slaps him awake every night. He gazes at the ceiling with adrenaline still tingling in his extremities. It vexes him to waste at night the strength he needs for each day. He gets up and wanders around the house. He turns on the kitchen lights, taking in the furniture and appliances, turns them all off again, and moves on to the two switches in the dining room, the one in the living room, another one in each bathroom. Sometimes he tries to come to my room, but Mom knows about his nocturnal dance and keeps the door locked, so my father leans against the back of the sofa and stares at the telephone until exhaustion sends him back to bed. 

One night, he imagines Morris in the café, looking at his watch and then at the pay phone, waiting patiently for it to be late enough to call. Then my father plugs the cord back into the wall. He is so convinced the phone is going to ring that he keeps his hand on the receiver, ready to pick it up at the slightest sound. And the phone rings. He picks it up fast; on the following nights, even faster. He learns to hear the click that comes before the ring, to pick up even before the bell trembles. He learns to lift the receiver to his ear slowly, without saying hello, imposing his own silence, gripping the cord tightly as he waits, feeling himself a part of that mute telephone. He thinks that he is learning to listen, for the first time in his life. As my mother starts inquiring about moving us closer to a specialized school, my father finds an unexpected respite in whatever it is that is coming through the receiver, which begins to feel more and more familiar to him. He no longer hangs up, but waits to be hung up on. Only then does he unplug the cord from the wall and go to bed.

In the end, my mother says, the arrangement is the best thing for me. My father agrees that my mother and I will move to La Plata, where my maternal grandparents live. In exchange, my grandparents will cover my medical expenses and the tuition for the special school. My father manages to negotiate a promotion that will allow him to pay for a trip to Buenos Aires every month, so that he can spend two afternoons with me before returning to the house in El Bolsón, where, now that no one but him spends the night there, the phone is always plugged in. Does the phone ring on those nights when he isn’t home? Or is there someone else to call when he can’t be there to answer? 

Among mute, deaf, and dyslexic children, I make new friends, I integrate, I make progress. Per the school’s requirement, Mom learns sign language to help me in my lessons. My father’s sign language is limited to essential expressions like “Sit still,” “Eat,” “I love you,” and “Time for bed.” He would like to learn more, but his energy is focused on making enough money to pay for the flights to Buenos Aires. 

Although I don’t utter a word, I read and listen with devotion. I’m fascinated by the French and English comic books my grandfather reads and translates aloud to me. He is a rigid man who sits every night at the edge of my bed, his enormous body sinking so deep into the mattress that the two of us guiltlessly accede to the laws of physics, my body leaning against his. At school I start to write, and at home, as we have already read almost everything that Grandpa has on hand, we write down, together, in French and English, impressions of our readings. I absorb the languages he teaches me, but he hasn’t learned a single word of sign. After each reading session, he closes the book and I grab one of his hands with both of mine and attack him suddenly. He grabs me in turn with one big hand, as if the beast I had just caught were now counter­attacking, victorious. The choreography is short and precise. Sometimes my grandpa grabs me by the wrists and lifts me up into the air. I don’t feel the energy of my father’s hands around my ankle, nor do I hang upside down the way I used to enjoy so much, but something in that suspension reminds me of him. Sometimes Grandpa holds me for longer than I can bear. I want to clap twice, my way of saying stop, but I’m hanging by one hand, and although I hit the other against my chest and against his, he obeys only orders that can be heard. So I wait, hanging in the air. 




What happens over the next fifteen years doesn’t surprise Mom, or Grandpa, or my father. I achieve everything that the family expects from a model child: outstanding grades in high school, a scholarship to a college in Buenos Aires. I turn to the most abstract language of all, mathematical physics. I study engineering, and before I even graduate, I accept a job offer at an oil company in Mendoza. 

At some point in the course of these years my father has become convinced that all he needs to do for me is to stay on the sidelines, and time has only confirmed this theory. But he feels my distance every day, and he knows only how to endure it. 

At the house in El Bolsón the silent phone calls still come, though more sporadically now. Once a week, once a month, a couple of times a year. Phones have broken free from the walls, but my father still keeps the landline. He sleeps better. If the phone rings, he answers, and then he sleeps even more soundly. 

One day, browsing a supermarket shelf, he discovers that button batteries now come with a safety coating to prevent accidental ingestion. He stands there staring until an employee comes over to ask if he needs help, but he is unable to answer, nor can he bring himself to buy a pack. He has to return two days later, to take one home and study it. In the living room, he struggles to remove a battery from the hermetic packaging. Once removed, it is so small that, if it slipped through his fingers, he would struggle to find it on the floor. As if to avoid some disaster, my father puts the battery in his mouth. He closes his lips and the host settles on his tongue for a second—less than a second. The bitter taste of denatonium benzoate explodes, burning his taste buds, forcing my father to spit. That the protective coating really does work is even more painful than if it didn’t. 

 

 

I see my father a couple of times a year. I let him know when I’m passing through Buenos Aires on the way to La Plata to see my mother and grandparents, and he hops on a plane. On one of those visits, we meet at a café near the airport, and he tells me that the house in El Bolsón finally has a buyer.

“Who is it?” I ask in signs. 

“Shoot,” he says nervously. “I don’t understand.” 

“Doesn’t matter,” I say, using my hands again, because “Doesn’t matter” is a sign that he did end up learning. 

“I’m moving to Buenos Aires,” he says. “We’ll be closer.” 

I smile politely. I know it doesn’t mean that our relationship will change. I live in a spacious apartment with three stealthy cats. I have a girlfriend, an almost-new car, and friends I play pool with. But he almost never asks about any of that. For him, visiting me still means coming to Buenos Aires. He doesn’t seem to get that I live even farther away, and that so many things happen in my life that I sometimes go weeks without thinking of him. 

The day he hands over the keys to the house in El Bolsón, he disconnects the landline from the wall for the last time and packs the phone along with the other things that he considers fragile. A moving company will collect the furniture and boxes a few hours later, but the important things will travel with him in the car. After nearly twenty years, my father is again driving the 1,055 miles between El Bolsón and Buenos Aires.

Since he begins the drive in the afternoon, he spends the night in Neuquén and starts out again early the next morning. Now that there are plenty of other service stations, now that gas yields twice as much, there is no need to stop at General Acha, and yet he finds himself stopping all the same. It’s eleven thirty when he approaches the YPF station, and there are only two cars filling up at the pumps. My father parks under the poplars, even more enormous and silvery than he’d remembered. He heads toward the café, breathes in the morning air, and thinks about how, between the moment he left the house yesterday and his arrival tonight in Buenos Aires, he is living without belonging anywhere. He exhales the air that entered cold and is now warm, and he experiences his temporary disappearance as a relief. He hooks his thumbs into his pockets, a mannerism he has seen in men who seem calm and confident. 

The old café is now a glassed-in self-service store with automatic sliding doors. Only the long wooden counter, tall and solid, is in the same place, adding a touch of warmth. And behind it, with the same PRIVATE sign, is the swinging door he went through so many years ago. He is surprised to not see the pay phone. Someone says “Excuse me” and pushes him gently aside. Where the phone used to be, there is now an ATM. My father is perplexed. He doesn’t know what he’s come for, and the absence of the phone confuses him further. Did he come to talk to Morris? My father has never hit a man in his life. Is that what he came here to do? “I’ve sold the house,” he’ll say to Morris. “Let’s see who you call now.”  

He recognizes the woman. Still tall and stout, though her hair is now lank and white. Two employees work the registers while she flips through piles of papers. She finds the one she’s looking for and walks away toward the swinging door. Then she stops, turning to him with her brow furrowed. 

“It’s you,” she says. “The father.” 

She comes around the counter toward him. 

“How is the boy?” She seems moved. 

“Good, good.” 

“Does he remember us?” 

“Oh, sure.” He realizes he’s nervous. 

“He gave us such a fright, you know . . . We didn’t know where he’d come from, and we didn’t know how to help him.” The woman stands looking at him with her head cocked. “Poor little thing.” 

She studies my father with nostalgia, as if together they had endured a drama of many days and weeks and now needed some time to get comfortable with their reunion.  

“Come. I want to show you something,” she says with a wave, walking toward the door behind the counter.

They cross the long hallway, still piled high with boxes. For a moment, my father has the feeling that when he reaches the other end he will find me there again, and maybe even Mom, too. If it all starts over again, will he have the information he needs to change things? He’s frightened to see that the living room is still so much like the one he remembers. 

“Look at this beauty,” the woman says, reaching toward a shelf and picking up a picture frame. “I hope you don’t mind. It’s just that we don’t have children—I don’t know, I just put it there.” 

It’s a drawing I made: my father, Mom, and me between them. 

“I tried to entertain him every way I knew how,” says the woman. “I brought him some wooden blocks we had in the café, I offered him candy, I let him watch TV. In the end, sitting down to draw was the only thing that distracted him awhile.” 

In the drawing I have large yellow hands with outspread fingers, and, at my larynx, a black pendant like a giant eye.

“Oh, but that boy was just so cute. I was already thinking about how to convince my husband to adopt him if no one turned up.”

“But something happened, didn’t it?” 

“What do you mean?” 

My father feels his voice change. The anger has arrived suddenly, tensing him up with a pain that doesn’t hurt, though it makes his eyes water. This, he thinks, would be the perfect moment for Morris to come in, now that his body seems to be preparing for battle.

“I know something happened,” says my father.

The woman’s smile fades. 

“He was a good kid,” my father says. “He’d gone through three surgeries and never stopped smiling. But we left him here with you for an hour and he was never the same again.” 

“What are you saying?” 

Then, yes, Morris comes in. Older, skinnier. He is carrying an open wallet and a credit card reader. He crosses the living room the same way he did twenty years before, probably headed for the same lockbox. When he sees my father, he stops.

“You,” he says, lowering the hand with his wallet. “What did you lose now?”

“Morris . . .” says the woman. 

“Something happened to my son,” says my father. 

“And apparently around here we’re always at your beck and call, right?” says Morris. “You already lost him once, remember? You lost him and we found him for you.” 

“Who found him?”

“I did,” says Morris. 

“Where was he?”

“By the phone.” 

Morris shakes his head, seeming to smile to himself.

“Come with me.” Morris heads down the hallway and my father follows. He feels a wave of dizziness coming and tries not to stumble over the boxes. What are they doing there, piled in the same place for twenty years? The woman is behind them, he can hear her footsteps catching up. In the convenience store, everything remains in motion. 

“Here,” says Morris, stopping in front of the small ATM.

“This is where the phone was,” the woman explains. 

Morris picks up an imaginary receiver at the height of his chest and lowers it to somewhere between his hip and knee. He holds it vertically. 

“About this height,” he says, and uses the palm of his other hand to mark how tall I was at that age. “Somehow your son managed to get the receiver down, but he couldn’t reach the buttons.”

Without moving the imaginary receiver, Morris spits something into his hand and puts it into a pocket. 

“So I told the kid, ‘You tell me the number and I’ll dial.’ ” 

The woman nods, confirming the story. 

“My son doesn’t talk,” says my father. The pressure he feels in his chest barely allows him to use his diaphragm. 

“What does that have to do with it? The kid asked to talk to his father, so I dialed the father.”

The pressure is so strong that the pain won’t let my father think.  

“But how did you know he wanted to talk to me?”

“What can I tell you? The kid pointed to the receiver and I asked, ‘You want to talk to Mommy?’ And the kid shook his head. Then I asked, ‘You want to talk to Daddy?’ And he nodded. Is everything this complicated for you?” Morris stares at my father. “I pretended to dial and I let him do his thing. You would have done the same, right?” 

My father is crying. Morris opens his eyes wide, exasperated. 

“I don’t get you. I really don’t know what else I can do for you.” 

“It’s just that my son doesn’t talk,” says my father. “If my son calls, how is he going to tell me it’s him?”

My father’s hands fall to his sides and there’s an almost imperceptible movement in his fingers, like that of someone asleep, maybe dreaming of breaking his fall or catching something fragile that’s falling, and what happens next that day doesn’t matter anymore.

Seventeen years later, my father dies, and, in that Buenos Aires apartment that he’s never gotten used to, I wait for the doctor to come and write the report. From beside his bed I tell him, “Don’t worry, Dad. We were happy, at first. That’s enough. Everything’s going to be okay, Dad.” And since he still doesn’t answer, I touch the hole that’s like an eye. I touch my father inside, and I let him go. "

    "text": "I didn’t understand. If that boy couldn’t read, why was he up there? The girl they originally had hosting the ceremony didn’t show, but why they put that boy there? Just because he volunteer for everything? You can’t read off enthusiasm. It made the whole school look trash. All he had to do was basically read the name of someone he already knew or sound out the first part and guess. He looking down at the paper like it’s an awkward lift. If he mispronounced my name, I’d snatch the mic and say, “Say it correctly. De-ra-ja-nae, boy! I know you. We know each other. Sound it out. Guess better. Use what’s around you.”

People wanted to hear they name said so they could leave. He was up there at the podium holding the mic sideways to his mouth with a weak spotlight shaking on his cap, struggling through the name Thomas. Talking about Thaw-mas. And Thomas standing right there in the walkway. Look up, boy! He ain’t even look surprised when Thomas tapped him on the shoulder and took the certificate. Thomas got Most Improved in Miss Telefort’s math class. After that it was all out of order, people just standing up for no reason, sitting down, not recognizing they own name. The vice principal was in the corner of the stage shouting categories like a loud shadow. I saw Azal a few rows ahead, giggling, and gave her a look that mean, You laughing at your dumb self. We all in the same class, idiot.

It was me feeling stupid for showing up. Over half the school ain’t come, so there might have been thirty kids, plus some parents and all the teachers. Miss Marie lied to me, said they had to borrow extra chairs from the restaurant next door. She make a bigger deal out of everything than it is. Talking ’bout “This is a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity to be recognized for your gifts.” If I was getting recognized alongside that boy Eliot, I didn’t want it.

The school used to be an office space so there’s a big lobby soon as you walk in and one of them spinning doors you can trap people in. They should have known not to put that in no school with me. We had too much fun with that. A boy we wouldn’t let out fainted once. He had been laughing until he just dropped. You would think they would have remodeled and not had a bunch of kids coming to school looking like it’s a nine-to-five. All gray marble and cold, but they tried to make it colorful with construction-paper drawings on the wall, signs, posters about what you could become, how you could shape the day. I wore a big sweater every day. It made me sleepy, and everybody including teachers knew not to bother me till fifth period. Now the sun was coming in bright and hot through the glass doors and I kept putting my hand up like it was to block the light, but also I was embarrassed. It was taking forever to hear my name. I was thinking maybe it wasn’t coming and they had me out there for nothing. And when Deshawn got Most Acrobatic I didn’t know why I even wanted anything to start with.

Mama was all teeth next to me, laughing under her breath and cooing at my baby sister. Racey was in a white onesie with race cars on it, doing somersaults in Mama’s hands. I for sure didn’t want Mama to come and for sure didn’t think she was, because she kept asking me, “What that thing is you was talking about?” like she couldn’t understand the words “first-semester awards ceremony” in sequence. They giving out awards to people, I said. Best at Science, Math, Most Improved, Funniest. It’s an incentive for us to do better or keep doing good, because it’s last-chance alternative school, and they can’t fail us for not showing up. The night before, Mama was on the phone and I told her not to worry about coming. She covered the phone and shook her hand at me to get out her face while she was talking. Like, Girl you know better than to bother me about foolishness when I’m on the phone. I didn’t get an answer about it till she started getting dressed. I’m betting Miss Marie called Mama and told her about the play I wrote to perform at the ceremony. I could tell she knew by how goofy she was smiling at me. I would just as soon her not be there. I was preparing to hear her little comments and have her make fun of this little fake school and these little fake awards. But Mama showed up with her toenails painted, slow striding, popping her gray sandals, each step a lick on the floor, makeup full done.

Miss Marie was sitting in the row in front of me with her back all straight like a little secretary. She good for being proper. She twisted her head to look at the phone in my hand like that was ’bout to stop me texting. I ain’t pay her no attention. We was only technically at school, and it was only a fake school to begin with. Wasn’t no rules for no award shows.

I couldn’t put my phone down no way. Robert kept texting me he was gon’ fuck me up again. I told him I couldn’t wait to see his little punk self and he was some wrong about how the fight was gon’ go down. He think I won’t jump him with my mama there, but Mama know I could fight. And if she saw me fighting, she was gon’ love screaming “Let ’em fight” for as long as I was winning.

I got kicked out my last school for fighting too good. I was the tallest girl in seventh grade, tall as the tallest male teacher. If you count my bun of braids, how I usually wear them wrapped on top my head where you can’t grab, I was three inches taller than him.

“Miss Marie,” I said to her back. “Why they got Eliot up there reading like that?”

“He wants to be up there, Derajanae.” She half turned her body around to whisper. “Pay attention to yourself and what you need to do.”

“Miss Marie, he can’t read.”

“You’re wrong. He’s reading.”

“He can’t read good.”

“He can’t read well.”

“So, it’s cool to correct me and not him.”

Miss Marie gave my mama a look for some help, but Mama just blinked. I could understand trying to be nice⁠—that only go so far though. The teachers should be embarrassed too, the way I feel about it. They supposed to be the ones responsible for Eliot reading, and then I’m mad cuz I’m the only one that’s mad. I bet if it was a regular school they woulda shoo-shooed Eliot offstage and handed him a lollipop.

“We ’bout to be here forever. I’mma take the mic,” I said, and stomped my feet hard enough for people to look. I wanted to pluck the back of Miss Marie’s head so bad. I put my thumb and middle finger close to that little brown puff she held back with that lusty brown headband. If I did it, she was gon’ act like it didn’t happen, but she the type to take it to heart.

“How you be in special needs class for a whole special needs school?” I said loud in no direction and Miss Marie looked at me like I was some crazy. By seventh grade, she’d tell us, you should know this, you should not be acting like that, but sometimes she be the one to put her head down on her desk and cry like a lil baby, but that was only twice. And one time I stood up and told people to stop playing with her. She raised her head and looked at me like a horse spoke, and that was probably why I was in the whole mess with the play. I was bucked up by my own heroicness in her eyes and she slid in and told me what else I could do.

I took my fingers away from the back of Miss Marie’s head and told Mama I couldn’t sit down no more. “Mama, let me hold Racey.”

Mama handed her to me, and I went to the back row and bounced her on my knee until she started to giggle from the phone vibrating hot and loud in my pocket. It was Robert. “Bitch, I’m at the park. Where you at?”

“Mama, here,” I said, rushing to hand Racey back just that quick.

“You two hours early,” I texted back.

“You said 4:30 I’m here at 4:30.”

“I said 6.”

“Ain’t no 6. I’m here now.”

“Hold up.”

I scrolled through our texts to fact-check, but we had been texting insults for two days straight. I was almost to the part where we set the time when he texted me again and my phone auto-adjusted back to the bottom.

“Check Instagram,” the text read.

I opened his page and Robert was Live from the park telling everybody I wasn’t all I said I was. He was moving the camera like he was taking selfies from different angles.

“Mama, I’m ’bout to be back, okay?”

“No, you not ’bout to be back. You not ’bout to leave me here.”

“Mama⁠—”

“Sit,” she said.

I kicked the back of Miss Marie’s seat hard. She looked at me for a long second, then stood up and said, “All right. Let’s go get a soda.”

“Soda. Why you say soda like that?” She sounded more like white people than any Black person I’d ever met. Sometimes we tried to see if she would break and sound Black when she mad, but it never happened.

“Okay, let’s get a cold drink,” she said.

They had a reception set up in the teachers’ lounge, with trays on a round table, jugs and jugs of juice, tea, and more paper plates than the few people there could ever eat off, but some of the tray tops were popped, so you could tell people passing by on they way out didn’t feel they had to wait to be invited. There was poster boards of our final projects tacked on the wall for the parents to see. Most the kids who did them was the ones who was there. I did mine on pink poster board. It was about the civil rights hero at the center of my play.

“Are you still mad about Eliot’s reading?” Miss Marie said.

“No,” I said. It was everything, felt like a big ole clown hammer was about to drop on me. I couldn’t say that though, cuz Miss Marie would have had to follow up and I’d have to placate her till she left me alone.

Miss Marie went ’round to the vending machine and straightened a wrinkled dollar on her thigh, then sat on a folding chair with the can, patting the chair next to her. I sat down intending not to talk, just sit there and be quiet, but I had to take out my phone to see if Robert was still on Live. He had set the phone down and was jump-roping with a few younger girls. At some point he was clapping and slapping his feet as he jumped, screaming, “Girl, where is Derajanae? It’s after four thirty, she hiding from me again.”

“Okay, how are you feeling?” Miss Marie said.

“I’m feeling like it’s four thirty and I got places to be. I’m for real annoyed.”

“What’s annoying you right now?”

“They got this boy⁠—Miss Marie, it’s dumb here.”

“What’s gonna make it not dumb?”

“I’m sorry. I want to go.”

“Is this about the play? People are going to love it.”

“People ain’t gon’ like nothing. People ain’t here. And I’m missing a fight I need to attend. My reputation on the line, Miss Marie, and you worried about a play.”

“Okay,” she said.

“No, it’s not okay. People gon’ talk all types of shit about me. I only got my name. You wouldn’t understand.”

“People know you can fight, Derajanae. You won’t let anybody forget that, but you know what they don’t know?”

“What?”

“That you’re a multihyphenate. People don’t know you’re a history buff and a playwright and you can kick their booties too, but they’ll know after tonight.”

I started going up in my texts again so Miss Marie would stop talking. I was gon’ screenshot Robert to make sure everybody knew he was lying about what time he was supposed to meet me.

“Okay, well, you text and get in the right headspace,” Miss Marie said. “Your big debut is coming up!” She did a lil jog out the door like she was missing something exciting.

I got to the text. I had put four thirty. I must have got everything confused. I put FaceTime on to contact Robert, but he was still jumping rope. I went back by Mama. Eliot was sputtering name after name and waiting with that big dumb look to see if the person was in the crowd. Everybody with sense had skipped the awards ceremony and there I was sitting up at school like a duck, looking around to see if somebody was online watching Robert’s Live.

“Mama,” I said. “Mama.”

“What, girl?”

“You want to go. I want to go. I ain’t stunnin’ this award. I gotta go places and Racey look tired.”

“Racey sleep. We not leaving before I see this play.” She dotted her sentence with a weak smile. All my mama’s smiles so weak.

“Mama,” I said, “it’s not gon’ be good.”

Our principal, Mr. Renner, was now standing right next to Eliot. He was white and young for a principal. He wore old-looking glasses and tight-fitting clothes and he was muscle-bound. The students loved him, especially the boys, because he pulled pranks with them. One time he bumped me on the shoulder on purpose while passing me in the hall. I swear he did. He got a smile for everybody, but you could see who he really was in how the teachers got tight when he around. He whispered into Eliot’s ear and after Michelle won something like Most Ready to Make a Leap in somebody science class for bringing a dried-up frog to school, Eliot said, “It’s gon’ be a break after Mr. Renner give an address.”

“Thank you, everybody, for coming out,” Mr. Renner said, replacing Eliot behind the podium. “I want you to know that this is a celebration not just for your children, but for us teachers as well. And we’re just as proud of their accomplishments. We’re going to take fifteen and prepare for a play written by our own Derajanae Reed.” Everybody looked at me and started clapping. Mama tried pulling my hands away from my face, then yelled “Yay” while she clapped with my wrist in her hands and rocked Racey under her arm.

I updated my socials: “Not tryna go back and forth with you hoes.” I tagged Robert in the post, then put up a pic of me looking bored and captioned, “Stars were born for stages. Y’all have fun rolling round the gravel lot.”

On the way to the teachers’ lounge, where we was changing, I pushed Azal. “Walk faster,” I said.

“Stop,” she said and turned around. She was light bright, had on expensive white tennis shoes, and always walked with her arms folded over her chest.

“Shut up. Ain’t nobody doing you anything,” I said. I wanted her to say something else but knew she wouldn’t. She had just won Most Inquisitive and had a confused look her whole slow way to the podium.

I wrote the play for Miss Marie’s Great Black Women of History class. We had practiced it all week and had beaucoup laughs in class, but Miss Marie started bucking us up about it and had us put it on again for Mr. Renner, and he almost clapped his arms off. We had bought into it too. My whole head was swole when Miss Marie told me we would be performing in front of hundreds of people. But on top of nobody being there, Eliot still hadn’t said my name, not for one award, not even Class Entertainer, which was backhanded. And people were leaving straight from getting they awards, clicking they heels at the door. You could see they daddies in the aisle and hear they mamas’ keys jangling even before Eliot got over that mountain second syllable. And for everybody that was too polite, intermission before the play gave them a chance to run to freedom.

We put our costumes on over our clothes. I put a silver wig into the red knit blanket I was going to wear, swaddled them in a light blue baby blanket, and clutched it to my chest. Miss Marie had made all the costumes herself. There were six of us in the show. I was the lead and most everybody else was both an imaginary white person and a Black person. I tried to get my little sister to play the baby, but Miss Marie said there was too much movement in the show. Eliot, who I ain’t never wanted in the play, was supposed to be Background Field Negro #1, a role with no lines, but when I looked over, he was putting on the House Negro wig.

“Eliot, you not changing parts,” I said.

“You trippin’, Derajanae. It’s two lines and Leo ain’t even came.”

“What are they?” I looked around, dramatic. “Why y’all laughing? Everybody better know they lines. What’s the lines, Eliot? Say the lines now.”

Miss Marie stepped in front me and snatched the wig I had on.

“Derajanae, if you don’t want to do the play, you can sit and watch, but it’ll only make you angrier.”

“Who gon’ play me?” I said.

“I’ll play you,” she said.

“You would never.”

“I would.”

I couldn’t tell if Miss Marie was serious about that threat, but she had proved to me she was willing to make a fool of herself  a lot, so I backed down. Miss Marie went over Eliot lines with him a couple of times and had him repeat them back to her. Then we snuck in the dark to the side of the aisle. I was looking at the crowd, which had gotten smaller and closer. Some was still heading back to they seats with paper cups in hand. The stage was a little raised black platform just above the ground. Miss Marie had a friend, a man, come set it up and some of the boys been cackling “Oh, they fucking” and that’s the sort of thing we dealing with. Now Miss Marie walked out with her hands behind her back and talked about how hard we’d been working, which was a lie because I had only wrote it in one class period, but she talked about it like the play had changed her emotional life.

Me and Miss Marie had to compromise on the play. She ain’t want no foul language and no making light of violence. During rehearsal she kept pecking at it and pecking at it until it was only kind of mine. She wanted to show a strong Black woman whose life wasn’t just struggle, because she say all you see about Black women is struggle and you don’t see no joy or love or none of who they are beyond what they can endure and who they can endure it for. But people was going to be asleep watching my character play with her babies and listening to a five-minute speech about human rights, so we met in the middle. And I think we had made it real good, as good as could be with what Miss Marie had laid out. She exited the stage and when the applause died down, that was my cue.

I walked out with the fake ball-of-clothes baby clutched to my stomach. Azal came from the opposite side, real proper, poking her chest out. I picked up a stack of paper plates, put them on a table, and smoothed the tablecloth.

“Belle, you’ve missed a mark,” Azal said. She took off a white glove, threw it over her shoulder, and pointed down to a stack of plastic cups. I hesitated. “Belle, are you being sassy?”

“No, missum. I’m not.”

“You needn’t ‘missum’ me, Belle, because I see the look on your face. Go fetch Mr. Chadwick and Danny boy. They’ll want to see you in the great hall.”

My character had a limp due to hardships. I was deep in character, clutching my baby and holding my lower back. I thought my limp was real good and dramatic, but people started to laugh. I twisted my face in pain so people would shut up, but the laughter got more confident. I couldn’t see nothing in the crowd because the spotlight was following me, but I took a couple circles ’round the stage just to make sure, bending my knee real deep and holding my back and they started howling, dying laughing at my every movement, and I knew that it was a comedy.

Miss Marie, she meant well, but it was still a comedy. And if people wanted to laugh, I didn’t see no harm if I’m the one making the joke. I decided against using Miss Marie’s version right there.

I walked up to two black poles set at the edge of the stage that were supposed to signify a big door. Before I knocked, I looked longingly out toward the crowd. Miss Marie had coached me on this moment. The look signified my longing for freedom, and nobody knew if they should laugh. I went to turn the fake doorknob, stopped, shook my head, and did the look again. I ain’t do nothing but what she said twice and people were falling out, like I could hear the chairs rattling and squeaking. Eliot rolled in  fifteen seconds earlier than I wanted him to, and I pushed him back through the door and told him to wait right there until I was finished knocking. I pulled him back through the door to laughter and he had forgotten his lines, which was perfect. I started feeding them to him. I said, “Repeat after me. Belle.”

“Belle,” he said.

“Belle, what⁠—” I said.

“Belle, what are you⁠—” But I interrupted him.

“Slow down, baby. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”

“Belle, what you doing by the great house? Were you called for?” Eliot said when people finally stopped laughing.

“I’mma here to see Mr. Chadwick and Mr. Danny boy.” I waited for Eliot to respond that he was gon’ go fetch them right away, but he froze up. “Ain’t you gon’ go fetch them right away?” I said.

“Yeah,” he said, and walked straight out the play to his seat, which creased the crowd up good.

Alex came through the black poles onto the stage. He was the one white boy in school. He wore big round frames and capri khakis like my grandmama wear and won both a math and a science award. Miss Marie ain’t like him playing the slave master, but we convinced her it would have been worse if he was a slave.

Alex walked hands on hips, shoulders back, big ole giant steps. He had a towel sticking out his shirt. “Belle,” he said, “I’m going to need that baby to sell.”

“You need my baby?” I said.

Here, in the Miss Marie version, Alex was supposed to take the baby, and the rest of the play was me running away and being prosperous through the years and beating Alex in a hard-fought court victory until I returned to him on his deathbed and he apologized to me for selling my baby, gave a little speech about a lifetime of regret and some details about the economics of slavery in the south, then, right before his heart gave out, told me he had no surviving record of the sale. After that, through years of joy and dignity and hard-fought victories in the face of oppression, my look of longing would signify my hope to someday be reunited with my baby until one day when I’m real old, I see a young freeman at the market all dressed in frill and the stage goes dark as I approach.

Instead, I put my head down like I was carrying a football and said, “Here the baby go!” then charged Alex hard. The crown of my head made contact with his chest and he went with it and stage-rolled, head over heels.

I started shouting a few of Miss Marie’s lines about seeing equity coming over the hills like a locomotive and started beating Alex over the head for what felt like too long, then whispered for him to call his men.

“Men!” Alex screamed.

The whole cast didn’t know what to do, so I started waving at them, giving directions. I shouted, “Come at me, Danny boy!” but nobody could really move on the little platform so I fell on my back and pulled their feet so they would know to fake stomp me. “White people!” I screeched, then used the cover of they legs to change into my next outfit. The baby was a wig, I put that on, and the blanket became a cape. Then I rose up and grabbed Azal by the neck like we had practiced probably a hundred times during rehearsals before Miss Marie cut the moment for safety concerns. Azal grabbed onto my arm, and I lifted her until both her little feet were wriggling in the air and I slammed her to the ground. Then I got one somebody into a chokehold between my legs and one in a chokehold under my armpit and they flailed off the stage to laughter, whoops, and applause. I crawled over to Alex’s body, put my foot on his chest, and stood up real tall with my hands on my hips and my head to the sky.

“I’ve become Sojourner Truth, a freedom fighter and feminist. I help my people, you all, gain freedom. Now I’ve come to take my forty acres, and this”⁠—I stomped on Alex’s chest⁠—“is my mule!”

I waited, my chest heaving, completely out of breath, and it felt like nothing would ever happen, but then the claps came. We took some bows and the applause took so long Azal and Thomas did splits, and the rest of the cast ran out to the crowd to stand up on chairs. I felt completely open and delicate and wriggly like a lid came off a cream bottle. Mama was raising Racey up and making faces and screaming for me. I had done something big and good, and my ears were burning hot. When we went to the teachers’ lounge to change, I ripped the wig off and we talked over each other about how we had done what we’d done and how who knew when to do what and everybody had they own little version of the story. It went like that until Miss Marie grabbed me from behind by the shoulder.

“How did all the script changes happen?” she said.

“On the spot,” I said. “Did you think it was good?”

“I did! It was a provocative, artistic vision.”

I ran back to my seat and Mama gave me a big ole hug and that dull-ass smile seemed just a bit brighter. I wanted to ask her if she thought provocative, artistic visions were a good thing. It had started to settle into my body that maybe nobody had liked the play and they’d been laughing at us, but people kept coming up and telling me how good I did.

Robert texted and told me he was leaving for his birthday party, and he guessed I wasn’t coming and he wasn’t gon’ let me show up to the playground alone like I did him, because he wasn’t no lil bitch like me. “It can’t be next weekend, because my uncle say I could help him around the shop for money, but he not ’bout to pay me if y’all show up and scare no customers away.”

I texted him back that it was good he was having a birthday, because he needed to grow up, and I had better things to do with my life than go to his uncle’s petty-ass auto shop.

More people were leaving and I was wanting to scream to everyone, “Wait!” Eliot was still sitting in his seat and I could hear a couple of the teachers trying to convince him to go back up and talking about how they couldn’t finish without him even though they literally couldn’t finish with him.

“Baby, you ready to go?” Mama said.

“Mama, you could go, but I’m not.”

“We got to go. Renata gon’ be by the house to come get me and I need to finish getting ready.”

“We came all the way out here and already waited this long. You can go, Mama, but I’m not going nowhere.”

“Come on, girl. You watching Racey tonight and I got to finish getting ready. I’m not staying in on no Saturday.”

“Mama, go!” I screamed.

Miss Marie came up and hugged me. “We got her,” she said. “It’s just a few more awards and I can make sure they get home safe. Here.” She put her arms out for Racey. “You have my word. It’d be a shame if she missed her name. I’ll hold on to the little one and put them both back in the house the second this wraps up.”

Mama started to riffle through Racey’s bag. She was frustrated, putting the bag on her lap and back on the floor again and back up on her lap. I didn’t know what she was looking for that was so important.

“What you did with this girl’s pacifier?”

“I ain’t touch it. She already got a pacifier.”

“She gon’ want the other one.” Mama switched the pacifier in Racey’s mouth and shoved her into Miss Marie’s arms and she was gone. I ain’t know what I expected. After Mama left, I felt silly and small because I had already screamed about staying and made some big deal about it when it wasn’t. I just wanted to see what my award was since I had been there and waited. Miss Marie sat next to me and I let her hug me and listened to Eliot, who they had clapped back to the podium.

The light was coming in orange through the doors. It lit a lopsided triangle on Eliot’s face. He kept killing people’s names, and they’d go up happy and tired, and he’d resay it when he saw who it was. Miss Marie was tryna act like she wasn’t dying to put the baby down and leave. Eliot was butchering names and none of them were mine, and it was drawing me out to the point I was about to give up when Mr. Renner stood behind Eliot to close the ceremony. Oh, so they gon’ do me like that, I thought. I was ready to blow, but Miss Marie started smiling at me. My face got hot and I told her to stop, because I knew to just wait. “This is the big one,” she whispered, and if it was the last one it was the best. I hoped I got Most Powerful Play or something that wasn’t made up like Realest. I could sing too, and I was getting better at math. I gave Miss Marie a big hug.

“This next award is the last one,” Eliot said. “It’s special, so our principal is coming up to speak on it. Thank y’all.”

Eliot got big applause, or what could be big applause from such a small crowd⁠—just a few folks standing and clapping. Me and Miss Marie stayed down with the baby, but she clapped what she could, and I rolled my eyes. I didn’t want to be mean but all that pretending was just bothering me, because he wasn’t never gon’ learn like that.

“This event has been a blessing,” Mr. Renner said. “Thank you, Eliot, for filling in for us. We’re all a bit tired, and hungry for those refreshments.”

When Eliot walked by me in the aisle, I pulled him down next to me by his sleeve and gave him the only reading advice I knew. “Don’t guess,” I said. “Sound it out. They gon’ laugh at you either way so you might as well take your time to do it right.”

He looked at me like I was some stupid and said, “That’s what I been doing.”

Some people just like that⁠—you trying to help them and they throw it back in your face.

Mr. Renner went on for a while. The whole room had mostly cleared out and it was dark. I had never been at school that late and the little yellow cup lights weren’t enough to light the whole lobby. “So,” Mr. Renner said, “this is a big night for me and it’s  a bigger one for the students and educators. I can’t thank those of y’all who came out enough, particularly our parents. And with that being said, it segues beautifully to our last award of the night. This is the big one and it couldn’t go to a more precocious,  tenacious young person.”

For the first time that night I forgot to be embarrassed. I bounced up out my seat and raised my hands high.

“This last award is for Derajanae Reed for the fall semester: Most Attendance.”

I waited for somebody to laugh. Nobody did so I started laughing.But they thought I was laughing because I was happy and they got these cheesed-out grins on their faces and even tried to shout me onstage. Miss Marie pushed on my back to go up like she thought I was being shy. She had my pink poster board rolled under her arm and a tray of sandwiches with slices of cake for her to take home on the seat next to her. I heard whooping from the teachers sitting on the marble receptionist’s desk. Most the extras had gone so it was just me and the people who worked there, like the janitor posted in the aisle. He had a mop in a bright yellow bucket waiting.

I put my face in my hands to give myself a second and someone went “Awwww” like I was crying real tears. They even chanted my name off-emphasis, like they were trying to make me mad as they could, like they wanted me to blow. But I surprised myself because I didn’t blow. I saw the blue baby blanket from the play on the chair next to me and grabbed it, and put it over my shoulders, and tied it at the neck, and did all that just as slow as I could. Then I practiced my limp. Real slow, all the way to the podium, so slow the applause died down. But the lobby was so empty everything echoed off stone and sounded full as anything."

    "text": "That summer we had decided we were past caring. It was just too tiring, rushing back and forth between mental institutions. My father was in a well-known sanatorium in Switzerland, but to see him each month mistaking himself for Alfred de Musset, talking to me as if I were George Sand, and reminiscing about wholly imaginary events—and doing so, moreover, with a gaiety and malice that had their charm, no doubt, but seemed singularly out of place under the circumstances—was a burden. What was still more of  a burden perhaps was that, deep down, I was very taken with this behavior, and, ensconced in the little train that made its way up to the village of Birgen against a magnificent backdrop of Alpine meadows and snowcapped peaks even in spring, I would make these monthly trips, the frequency of which I myself had determined—not too many, not too few—with the same feeling of terrified delight I had always experienced in my dealings with my father. Perhaps he would be better that day and make more sense? And sometimes he was. But I’m not sure I preferred him that way. I think, unfortunately, that I preferred him mad. On the train I would prepare to be mistaken for George Sand or some character in a book. He didn’t entirely mistake me for someone else—he knew I was his daughter and he knew about my life. He might ask for my news, inquire about my work or friends, but something would quickly slip out of gear. If he was happy, as much of the time he was, his imagination would start to bubble over, rather as it does when you are writing. It was this kind of secret joy, which had something slightly erotic about it, that would lead him to reminisce about books he had loved, books that had meant a lot to him, at which point he would start to overlay our conversation with a sort of pall or veil of images and recollections drawn from books he had read, not from our lives. The moment when the veil appeared was always very moving. It was the moment I was waiting for, I think, and the reason I loved my father so much. If I was feeling sad or anxious, I would try, often quite brutally, to thrust the veil aside. He wasn’t upset, I think, when I did this; it startled him. He would look around slightly, tilting his head like someone who has heard a noise he can’t identify or locate. Bringing him to his senses was always a cruel move, one that I even found distasteful.

If I agreed to being laid under this veil with him—agreed, that is, not to contradict him in his joyful flow of speech—I would be drawn into a stream that struck me as both my true life and dangerous for me. My father enjoyed socializing, and even within the confines of the sanatorium would greet any fellow patients we ran into with warmth and courtesy. You would have thought he was holidaying in pleasant company at some country home. What he most enjoyed with me was having conversations about art. If we were discussing a painting, a piece of architecture, or the beauty of a city, he would know a hundred and one things that would always surprise me, because though he was very well read, he hadn’t traveled much and had lived for a long time in the provinces. His memory, on the other hand, was prodigious—he could remember books he had read in his teens, theatrical performances he had been passionate about as a young man, as if he had encountered them yesterday. Time meant nothing to him. Eros and its torments were his great theme.

When it was my little sister I was visiting, at Combleux, the atmosphere was quite different. Inès wasn’t cheerful like my father, she was forceful and focused, implacably alert. But there were many things I got wrong about my sister, I think, and I never fully understood who she was. Something inside her was asking to explode, and explode it did. She didn’t mistake her mental hospital for a holiday home. She was more present than one should be or can be present, she was supremely present in a way, and the task I had set myself was to relax that presence, not to diminish it but to soften it up. We talked a lot and it wasn’t at all like the conversations  I had with my father, because behind our words there was always a text that neither of us could read, which we would pore over and study without ever managing to decipher it.

My life, then, went from Birgen to Combleux, and from Combleux to Birgen, with stopovers in Paris, where I would pause for breath. But as soon as I had been in Paris for a while, I wanted nothing more than to return to Combleux and Birgen.

My other sister made similar journeys from a different town, where she lived. I never went to my other sister’s town and she never came to Paris. But that summer, in the last days of June, we decided for the first time to give ourselves a few months’ rest and to do so together. We would go neither to Combleux nor to Birgen, we would go to Capri. We remained there for quite some time because my sister had found a little job on the island, and I for my part had obtained a student grant. It was then that alarming news reached us from Birgen and Combleux: Father critically ill, sister too. Should we have rushed back? Oh, we would have loved to! But it was no longer possible, we were caught between the walls of petrified Capri. I’ve always felt bad about not being George Sand one last time at my father’s bedside as he departed this bewilderingly hard-hearted world, about having no other memory of Combleux than that of a monumental tragedy. In some respects, I was saying one day to my remaining sister, our life is much less exciting now. She was shelling peas on the kitchen table in the old family home, and she didn’t say a word, she didn’t even look up."

    "text": "Nobody really knows how it began. Word first started getting around on a Thursday, but that doesn’t prove anything: it might have all begun days or weeks before that morning in early summer when the cigarette and the newspaper vendors at the train station reported that the soldiers were coming home and that they had seen Diego Uriarte getting off the train that brings the milk cans, the previous day’s newspapers, and the packages of orders from wholesalers.

Jiménez, from the magazine kiosk, and Kentros, the cigarette vendor, started spreading the news that same morning, and that’s why everyone in town believes that that was the day the soldiers started coming home, but it might have begun earlier: the previous day, or the previous Thursday, on another train, or on that same train, the one that always pulls out of the capital just as it’s getting dark and arrives early in the morning, the one they call the night train.

That they had seen Diego Uriarte get off the night train. That they saw how he said goodbye to a group of soldiers with splints and bandages and leaped onto the platform from the mail car, and how two other men, also in uniform, jumped off after him. That Jiménez thought one of them must have been Miguel Sanders, but that neither he nor Kentros recognized the other, a slender man with a dark complexion.

That’s what they told everyone, and they also said they saw the three boys wave goodbye to the other soldiers and walk toward town already illuminated by the rising sun, though lights still shone in the square and at the station and in the windows of some of the bigger businesses.

Then the three boys parted ways and each went on alone: Uriarte down the main street toward his house; the dark stranger to the road leading toward the orchards; and the other man, the one Jiménez said must have been Miguel Sanders, up the embankment and toward the limestone quarry. Kentros hadn’t recognized him, but it could well have been the Sanders boy, he said, because the Sanders family lives on the other side of the quarry, past the white hill, and that was the way you would go to get to his mother’s house.

And it all began that morning. At least as far as anyone knows, though it could well have begun days or weeks before. But it was widely discussed that morning, because the two men who were at the station waiting for the train to arrive recognized Diego among the three returning soldiers. As a boy, Diego Uriarte had been beloved by all, because his father ran the buffet at Club Social, which also housed the casino; because he’d been captain of the basketball team and a champion pelota player; and because everyone in town thought that Diego Uriarte had died two years ago on the front, and there had even been multiple funeral Masses. That, more than anything else, is why word traveled so quickly and why everyone remembers and agrees that the soldiers started coming back that Thursday, the fifth of December.

Of course, nobody was going to tell Diego that they’d given him up for dead and had even attended his funeral. In his family’s shock and jubilation at seeing him alive and home, nobody mentioned it. He must have shown up at his father’s house, taken off his uniform for the last time, and gone straight to sleep, exhausted from the journey, happy to finally lie down in a clean bed. It wasn’t until Saturday afternoon that he was spotted downtown, on the sidewalk in front of the soda fountain and around Club Social’s card tables, and by then everyone knew he was back and they were already starting to forget the eulogies and funerals.

Later, though, there had to have been someone who, out of curiosity or as a joke, told him—or one of the others who returned—about the funerals. Not Miguel Sanders, though; nobody told him. The Sanders family lives on the other side of the sierra, past the limestone quarry, and they almost never come into town; they shop at Santiago Nasar’s country store and go to parties and dances in another town, where Miguel’s mother’s sisters live and where he and his siblings went to elementary school. But somebody, some joker or busybody, must have told Diego Uriarte, or one of the others, that everyone in town, even their own mothers, had given them up for dead.

There are issues of logic: Federico Ortiz’s mother reportedly received condolence telegrams from the military, the edges dyed black, and then an indemnification check that she cashed at Banco Provincia. Most of the mothers, if not all of them, probably received checks or telegrams regarding their deceased sons. But it was to be expected: sooner or later, Ortiz’s mother or Uriarte’s mother, if she’d also received a telegram or a check—or some other mother who received a check or a telegram—must have mentioned the whole thing to her son, and more than one of the mothers had probably been going around wondering if the money—a few lousy pesos—would be reclaimed by the government.

But there’s no way to know for sure whether Ortiz’s mother or any of the other mothers ever said anything to their sons or to their friends or to their friends’ sons. When it came to the subject of the telegrams and the checks, they maintained silence, the way mothers maintain silence about many things. Or did they intuit everything from the beginning  … ?

It was the December 5 train that was the first known case, but it might have all begun earlier. Throughout the summer, the Wednesday-night trains—always arriving between five thirty and five forty-five on Thursday mornings—continued to drop off returning soldiers. And soldiers’ mothers, who knew their sons might be discharged, began going out to wait on the platform. They would wait, and later, as the train continued on its way, slowly climbing the sierra baja, a group of weeping women would crowd around a few dead-tired soldiers. All of them weeping: some with joy because they’d just welcomed their sons home; others because the sons they’d been hoping would step off that train hadn’t returned to them.

These things come with war, and mothers, who willingly resign themselves to bringing children into the world and to raising their own children and the children of others, do not know how to resign themselves to their children going missing, and so they kept heading out to the platform to wait and to hope, many with their husbands or with stepchildren or daughters-in-law or grandchildren, and so, early every Thursday morning, a crowd would gather at the station to await the arrival of the night train.

But in those final weeks—in March, or April, during the rainy season—very few went out to wait.

The last soldier arrived at the end of April, alone. It was Sergio Guebel, the son of the Jewish owners of the farm supply store. At the train station, he was greeted by his parents, some neighbors, the girl who had been his fiancée, and Jiménez and Kentros, who had been talking to Sergio’s father about the war and reported that the old man smoked one cigarette after another on the platform, soaked by the rain, waiting.

Apparently Sergio Guebel stepped out of the second car, kissed his mother, who was weeping, and he wept too, not so much at seeing his family but at having to say goodbye to his fellow soldiers, who’d been with him throughout the war and would no doubt be getting off in other towns, along the final stretches of the railway line.

Guebel’s mother never received a condolence letter or a check. Instead, she had received a letter of commendation, because her son, the letter said, had carried out a heroic deed against enemy tanks. Seeing Guebel around town, his baggy old uniform, his worn-out combat boots, no medals and not even a captain or sergeant insignia, led one to believe that the telegram could have said that, because it could’ve said anything at all.

“With everything that happened, who would be stupid enough to believe the telegrams?” said Emilio Renzi, who had just won the Teleloto and had been leaving the post office after depositing the check when he ran into Sergio Guebel.

Back then, poor Sergio was walking around downtown like a big turkey, still in uniform, because his old man hadn’t yet bought him new clothes or put him to work driving the truck, a job he can be seen doing to this day: driving that truck, hauling drums of herbicide, bags of seed, and well-balanced pig feed.

“With the whole to-do with the check and everything they deducted and the three days I had to wait for them to process it, I wasn’t even thinking about the war. I was leaving the post office and heading toward city hall and I saw him just standing there like a dummy … I almost fell on my ass!”

Renzi always tells the same story, about how he came out of the post office and almost fell on his ass, and how even if Sergio had turned up with a new face and changed his voice, he would’ve recognized the Russian by his stupid joke: Lucky at cards, unlucky in love, he says Guebel said, acting as if he were in on all the town gossip.

War is a thing riddled with error. For example: in the battle of August 22, the artillery intended to shell a shuttered DuPont factory, where the enemy was storing munitions and medications, but they bombed another factory, the Dinam factory, because on an old map of the city they were attempting to occupy, the names of the factories had been mixed up. Who knows how many  people working in that factory died due to the error of an illustrator who made a bad copy of the guide to the capital? Hundreds or thousands of people needlessly killed because of an error on  the map … ! The shelling of the Dinam factory is only one example: all that expertise and research just to reduce the wrong factory to rubble.

But people adapt, they get used to it. It’s the same in big cities as in small- and medium-size towns like this one; people adapt. Cayetano Sain, who made a fortune reselling flowers, explains it like this:

“I was trying to quit drinking. I drank all I wanted at meals—I drank wine but no vermouth and not a drop of liquor except at mealtime. One Saturday I was at the soda fountain, way in the back, and I sat down next to Jesús Noble, another one of the returned. This was a while after the soldiers started returning on the night train, but I hadn’t seen Noble yet. I greeted him as if nothing had happened. He was friendly, and he greeted me as if it had only been a week since we’d last seen each other. Who knows if it was just random, who knows if maybe, after seeing so many people at the soda fountain, he thought he’d already run into me. He was drinking white wine and I joined him. By the second round, we were telling stories and shooting the breeze. I think I drank around ten glasses, and they had no effect. He kept up, drank as much as I did. Half in the bag, he struggled to get up from the table and almost choked on his tongue when he tried to speak. But for me, I felt like I could’ve been sitting there with anyone, as if it were my foreman, Rogelio, at the table instead of him. It felt natural …”

Because habits overpower everything. According to Pugliese, the town auctioneer, habits always win out in the end. He tells a story about how, one day, he and Avelino, his associate, were checking out a small farm, and when Avelino had to leave to go see a client in the city, Pugliese let him take the car, because Quirós—another one of the returned—offered to give him a ride back to town in his truck, a Scania.

Pugliese says that he got into the Scania and wouldn’t have remembered anything about the war if he hadn’t noticed the medal hanging from the sun visor, one of those nickel medals with the words Cristo Vencedor and the general’s face engraved on it. Then he remembered, he says, and that moment really made an impression: “Keep in mind I was on the church committee, so I attended all the funerals, including his, including Quirós’s.”

But Pugliese had such a good time talking to Quirós about radios and radio-aficionado things that he forgot again right away, and it was as if the guy driving the Scania were his associate, Avelino, and not one of the returned.

“And, look, I already knew, from the parish committee, about what’d happened in the other towns …” Pugliese clarifies.

Even when you’re aware of exactly what’s going on, other people’s behavior still carries the most weight: the truth is what you see other people do with your own two eyes, nothing else matters. Even Torraga, who didn’t want his daughter to marry Horacio, a returned soldier she’d dated as a girl, acknowledges that:

“It’s not that I thought my daughter didn’t love him, or that the boy was no good. But when Horacio, who was coming by the house all the time, asked me if he could marry her, I told him we needed to think about it, because I’d seen how Orlando’s daughter had married one of the returned about three years before and they hadn’t had any children. Doctor Álvarez’s widow, the midwife, who later married another returned soldier, Márquez, had been trying to get pregnant for two years and couldn’t, and she was a midwife. It was because of that fear, not because I looked down on the boy, that I asked her to reconsider. But today nobody can stop kids from getting married, and if the girl’s father opposes it, it’s worse—they meet up in highway motels, and when you pass by on Saturdays you see those places packed with kids and cars belonging to their parents parked outside and you know exactly who’s inside, rolling around like dogs in heat …”

That’s how it goes with habits and how people adapt, and—more than anything you might think you know—it’s what people show you with their actions that matters. These days, people accept the fact that boys take their parents’ cars, pick up girls in town, and drive out to the highway motels around midnight on Fridays and Saturdays, and the fathers—to whom, back when they were dating the women who are now their wives, it never would’ve occurred to do such things, leaving their cars out along the highway for everyone to see—now let their daughters head off to the motels as if they were local festivals. And someone like Pugliese, who attended Quirós’s funeral, can now lightheartedly go rabbit hunting with him, and Avelino can even spend entire nights playing poker with Diego Uriarte, who never married and wound up an inveterate gambler, who leaves everything he earns from working behind Club Social’s buffet counter on the card tables of the same establishment.

And it’s not like they’ve done anything in particular to draw scrutiny either. Nobody would claim they’ve gone unnoticed, but their actions haven’t attracted people’s attention, as if maybe they knew that, as time passed, the whole town would come to see their presence as natural—through the power of adaptation.

Occasionally they’re seen together, in twos or threes, due to such coincidences as sometimes happen. Once, when Marina Echagüe took her students to the racetrack and sat at the first turn—where the majority of the young men like to position themselves so they can see how the cars come in at top speed, slam on the brakes, drop into second, and take off laying rubber—she spotted Federico Ortiz, and nearby, in a row of men from Club Social, was Diego Uriarte, and in the next seat she saw Juan Molina, another of the returned. It might have been a coincidence, but Marina says that when people from the crowd went out to help push Rubolino’s car, which had slammed up against the fence, the three of them—Diego, Juan, and Federico—stayed right there, together, talking among themselves, and, even though they’d been back for so long, that sight really struck her.

There are times—at baptisms, business openings, weddings—when two or more of them come together, and there’s always someone who sees them talking and horsing around and can’t help but wonder. And there was a whole lot of wondering when people learned that the same thing hadn’t happened in other towns. The news came from some members of the parish, who’d gone to an assembly in Coronel Insúa where the subject came up, and, seeing the shock of the other people in attendance, decided to ask around and discovered that theirs was the only town whose soldiers had all returned. At that time there was an increased curiosity about what they were up to—if they conspired together or spoke to each other—but nobody noticed anything different. Again, you see, they trusted that, as time passed, the fact that this had happened only in their town would also be forgotten.

And they were right, because over the years, it was all forgotten. At a time when many couples are starting to design their own houses, take trips abroad, and spend nights out at parties—copying each other’s mannerisms, showing off new clothes, and checking out the new clothes and consumer goods others are showing off—couples without children are becoming more and more common, and so it’s not surprising that they don’t have children either, given that they make up only a small fraction of those childless couples who are always showing off their new clothes. In the end, kids keep getting born.

The children born that summer the soldiers started coming home must be around ten years old now and probably don’t know anything about it. To those kids, everything to do with the war is just a story for adults, and when they interact with one of the soldiers—when, on occasion, Ortiz’s or Vigliani’s nieces and nephews are left in their uncle’s care—they play with them like they would with anyone else, and their uncle lifts them up in the air or takes them to the circus or to the movies when there are movies playing that they’re allowed to see, just like any other uncle in town would. So these kids grow up knowing nothing—same as the adults, who go around without acknowledging what’s been happening all these years.

That’s why no one will ever tell them, and the kids will grow up, have children of their own, live, and die without knowing any of this, but many people do write these things down and save them, in case, years later, somebody might be interested. There’s a teacher at the school named Morizzi: he came as a substitute for a few months, liked it here, and stayed in town. He has a degree in philosophy, enjoys literature, and spends his free time and vacations compiling other people’s writing and organizing writing contests for the town’s ministry of culture. He can confirm that the kids of today will probably never really know what happened.

“It’s,” he said one night in a bar, “like with fish: the last thing a fish realizes is that it lives in the water.”

“Until someone goes fishing and catches it …” reasoned the Turk.

“Of course,” Morizzi answered, “but then it’s already dead, and it won’t do it much good to know it spent its life in the water …”

When there’s no wind, on windless summer nights, and also in the winter, before storms, from anywhere in the city you can hear the passing of the trains. At midnight the Northern comes through, all lit up inside because it’s always carrying first-class passengers who, as they’re shuttled across town, are enjoying some postprandial conversation in the grand dining car. At one thirty, the Express rolls in, a freight train that, despite its name, slows down to change tracks. At four, there’s the Combo, which departs the capital at six in the evening, with both freight and passenger cars. That train doesn’t stop, but the guard waves the green-and-red lantern in greeting as it passes the signalman’s booth. The whole town knows those trains and how to recognize them, and sometimes, waking with a start in the middle of the night, they’re gripped by a fear that the train that’s suddenly arrived is neither the Northern nor the Express nor the four-o’clock Combo, that it might be a New Train, coming in from the opposite direction, that stops in town, releases a long mournful whistle, and pulls slowly away, bound for the capital, and that it takes all of them away, again, forever.

    "text": "Some natural flowers had been allowed to bloom across the field. Sunflowers, the big ones, he couldn’t remember the name,  Giganteus blah blah. Buttercups, he at least knew those. A pinkish type. Fine petals drawn upward like bunched fingertips. Bees bounced from one to the next. The field was bright green. Unnaturally so, as if it had been dyed, which he supposed it might have been. The rest of the flowers were fakes. Made from a light plastic able to sway in the breeze, and if there was no breeze, the breeze might also have to be reproduced, an industrial fan clattering in the background of the opening scenes.

Michael wore his costume, everything except the head, which waited upside down at his feet. He was hungover. No point in putting on the head until the director was exactly ready. His body below the neck had already entered that familiar and strange dissociation, brain struggling lightly against the sight of his hands, now enormous and blue. A stomach also enormous and blue. In the early days of the job he had found this moment fascinating. Stroking his blue stomach with his blue hands, nerve endings firing as if each were his own.

The director clapped his hands. Right, assemble! He was secretly sweet, Michael thought. The way he sucked in his paunch, still visible through those black T-shirts he preferred. The director clapped again, impatient, although everyone was already falling into place. A large and horrible lamp was used to intensify the sunlight. The other actors appeared beside Michael, heads tucked against the sides of their chests. Red, Purple, Green. Colors given the personalities of feral children. Left to live inside what looked like a metal bunker on this fake green hillside. 

Here we go again. Gio, the other man, half-heartedly sexist, saving up asides for Michael. He believed the women who played Red and Purple were better built to survive the costumes, that for men it was harder, more torturous. Michael tried to respond only in disinterested smiles, though he found Gio’s bitterness attractive. His silence hadn’t yet put Gio off.

A woman from costume, her name momentarily gone from Michael’s mind, brushed down their bright fur. Tutted at Michael, picked his head up off the ground, wiped the top with a heavy hand. Try not to if you can, gets very mucky very quickly. Michael nodded, loyal. They were not stars. No one much gave a shit about the people inside the characters. The director waved his hand. A wedding ring, Michael noticed for the first time, winking in the harnessed sun. Perhaps he didn’t always wear it, perhaps he only wanted to be heterosexual on special occasions. 

The heads were put on. For the first few seconds, Michael closed his eyes. Breathed in, breathed out. On the fifth or sixth movement of his lungs, the costume tuned in. Heft of fur and polyester, heft of muscle and blood. Noises commingled, that syncing of bodies real and otherwise. Today, whispers of alcohol on his breath. Pressure in his face, pushing outward. At his eyebrows, at the hinge of his jaw, at the pause of his temples. And in his neck, a pain newly building. The weight of the head slowly fucking up his spine. 

Last night had been fun enough. Commemorative stamps of Princess Diana had just been released and the George had thrown a party. One man, tall, Michael guessed at a pierced nipple beneath his T-shirt, had wanted to know what Michael did for a living, wet lips touching his ear. You’ll never guess, Michael had flirted chaotically, casting himself into myth.

Michael shuffled forward. Behind Gio, behind Green. Red and Purple already in position, their huge neon forms shifted about by a DP, then by the director. For vibes, they played the theme song. The crew groaned and rolled their eyes in acceptable self-loathing. Michael smiled even though no one could see him. He was able to see only through fine slits in the creases of the costume’s cheeks, his vision striated. In his ear a hard whistle, then the director’s voice hummed. Everyone on? All four lifted their massive hands. Scene three, after the surprise arrives, let’s run down the hill, is the dog ready, Kate, is the dog ready?

Michael swiveled to better see the dog. Led onto the grass by a handler all in khaki, her color palette infinitely dull against the green grass, the fake flowers. Bandy legs, a long snout, a perfectly round brown spot on its flank, like a child’s drawing of a dog. That was the idea, Michael supposed. His eyes swam a little. The pain in his neck expanded. The handler whispered something to the dog, who had begun to pant, perhaps in anticipation. She scratched its neck fondly, which to Michael seemed unprofessional, he figured the world of animal handlers ought to be cold and intellectual. Leash unclipped, the dog stayed sitting. Freedom had never crossed its mind. Right, Red and Purple, off you go, then Blue and Green five seconds behind. Names lost to their colors, they lumped down the hill. Red and Purple impossibly sprightly, kicking together their inflated heels, stretching the fabric of their armpits into a two-handed wave. Maybe Gio was right after all. Michael stumbled forward, the incline steep beneath his blue feet, or paws, the costume’s intention not particularly clear.

Release the dog! Go the dog! The woman in khaki snapped her fingers. The dog took off after them, a large brown spot swimming between their multicolored legs. Cut, cut. They stopped running. Michael damp with sweat, the smell of alcohol sweetening. He turned toward the director, enjoying that belly in profile. Sorry, sorry, can we get the dog to show some excitement? The woman in khaki nodded furiously. The dog, meanwhile, had resumed a sitting position, this one a little tenser, sharp white teeth pressed over purple gums. Like, can the dog maybe jump, or bark, or something, it needs to be lively, you know? She nodded and nodded. Right okay, good work guys, let’s go again, okay, action! The woman in khaki took off along the edges, ducking and weaving between the cameras and cameramen, the tall booms, the assistants holding coffees and elbows. She called out to the dog, wanting it to leap, to break its hard-earned control. The dog stopped to watch her. Michael found himself doing the same. She seemed to draw on a deep-held mania, more animal than her animal. 

Gio nudged Michael’s elbow. Michael tilted to the left. He was holding up the scene, he started his run again. The dog, attuned, began its mimicry. Barked excitedly. Something in it momentarily broken apart. No longer flashing between their legs but looping around them, herding. Cut! Cut! That’s it, nice work. The woman in khaki now heavy with exertion. Motioned to the dog, crouching, her arms open. Michael had expected a tin whistle. Short, sharp commands.

Next, next we’re in the flower beds, we need you to get the dog to sit, or whatever, can it do tricks? The woman in khaki smiled. Michael watched the words find shape in her lips: Of course. The director’s voice buzzed slightly, an octave of stress. Right, can we get the dog back in here, please, the dog? 

The woman in khaki strode across the field. The pockets on her shorts bulged. Filled with treats, with leads, with small bags for dog shit. The dog walked at her ankles, looking up at her with every step. Did it, did the dog, feel pleasure in their connection? Michael wondered. She did, anyway, kneeling to talk to it sweetly once again, reminding it of its goodness, of its ability. Okay guys, guys, you’re shocked, remember, don’t know what a dog is and now you have one, get the dog to stay sitting, guys, sort of move around him in a circle. Purple knocked into Green, into Gio, as he tried to move the other way. Counterclockwise! Please! Counterclockwise! Fucking hell. An eye roll in the director’s voice. They moved again, Gio allowed to lead. Now sort of lean in and stare, like What is this strange thing!!! What is it!!

Purple was, of course, the most confident. She bent low, fixed a hand to her elbow, rocked her head. Bex. She was classically trained. Always the first to respond to the director’s desires. A thespian’s way about her that Michael loathed and envied. Gio spread his arms wide and shrugged, his shoulders cute. 

Michael was overthinking the body experiencing confusion, how his limbs would stupefy, what he might be able to bring to the scene. Red, Jo, scratched the top of her head with drama, the enormous hand able to move only in giant circular motions. Michael stood. Looked at the dog, which sat patiently at the center of them all. He could see where its lungs were located, the soft chest expanding and collapsing. Had to do something. Experimented, planted his palms on his hips. He frowned, raised his eyebrows, forgetting, in his haze, that no one could see his face. The director back in his ear: Blue, we need a bit more than that, you’re thinking, What is it, what is it, I’ve never seen anything like this before!!!! The others continued their movements as Michael’s hands remained on his hips. He added a new gesture, moved a foot from side to side. This was not confusion, this was not lighthearted curiosity. 

Cut, cut. The director strode across the fake green. The dog lay down, noticing the pause in action. Michael did not see if the woman in khaki had given any particular command. Maybe she had, the dog not able to read the room, understanding only her humanness and nobody else’s. 

Blue, Blue, come on, you okay in there? The director’s stomach glanced Blue’s stomach. He knocked on Blue’s head, a little roughly. Michael hoped it was playful. Yes, sorry, having a mind blank. The director sighed as if to say, Another one?! He knelt on one knee, indicating that Michael do the same. It was difficult not to feel like the dog, so Michael committed, letting his tongue leave his mouth. He was already panting anyway. Now lean closer, you can put your hands back on your hips if that’s what you want. Michael obliged. The director stood, his belly gloriously close to Michael’s face. That’s it, that’ll work, just keep doing that. Had Michael not been so hungover he might have released a laugh, but instead it remained lodged somewhere behind his collarbone.

Right, let’s go again. Adrenaline unclenched Michael’s temples. Relief. He stayed on one knee, then felt inspired to elaborate, to show he could do the job, dropping to both knees, leaning close enough to smell the dog’s breath. That’s it, nice one Blue, great job Purple. Bex was competitive. Her head rocked harder, she paced, added flair to her gripped elbow. Gio maintained his shrug. Jo’s hand went around and around her enormous head. Now Michael did laugh, the sound immediately inappropriate, shooting through the mics, the entire set privy to his interior. A broken rule, to make fun of their actuality in the middle of its unfolding. 

Bex was the first to respond, a muttered forfuckssake, the texture of her mouth audible. Gio touched Michael’s arm, a patronizing kindness that Michael was annoyed to find thrilled him. A bee cut clumsily between them, aiming for a fake flower. 

The director decided to save him. Yes, ha ha, very funny Blue. Some of the tension dissipated. Bex unfolded her thick arms, how she’d managed to contort the costume Michael couldn’t understand. Look let’s take a break, ten minutes everyone, smoke your cigarettes, drink your Diet Cokes. Gio pulled off his green head, his cheeks still pale, no sweat broken. Waited for Michael to do the same. He did not want to. Preferred to be Blue, spine twisted. Come on man, take it off. One sec. Michael walked away. Found the nearest trailer with a bathroom. Closed the door. Concentrated on his reflection, Blue’s round, sweet eyes, the permanent expression gentle, an innocent blue curl at the center of the cream forehead. Michael freed his hands from the paws, which he left hanging like mittens. Raised his arms with great effort, loosening the head at the squat neck. He looked fine, really. Pupils dilated. The now-familiar dark circles, slightly swollen eyelids. Checked his teeth, dragged his fingers across his cheeks, feeling the call of his sinuses. Half thought he would cry. Creased his face, but nothing. Here was his body, completely uninspired. 

A gentle knock at the trailer door, then Gio’s face. You okay in here man? His Italian accent strengthened in the display of empathy. Yeah fine, just dizzy, too hot. Gio’s shoulders moved in that same cute shrug. It’s not so hot. Now that Gio was headless, Michael could watch the hint of his bones beneath his skin. Not for you maybe. Michael tried a smile. Saw it in the mirror, the straining of his jaw, his neck. Gio smiled back. Listen don’t worry about her, she’s a bitch. Michael tried not to flinch at the word. Gio meant Bex. He thought, enjoyed even, that Michael might be upset about her reaction. Oh it’s fine. Seriously, what a bitch, she thinks she’s so much better than everybody. Gio hit his nose with a forefinger. She’s the same as us, please, she’s no better. He waited for a reply. Michael hesitated. I’m sure she didn’t mean it, I was holding things up anyway. Gio was disappointed. Okay, well, whatever man, see you out there. Yeah, see you out there.

Michael waited a few seconds to be sure Gio had gone. Opened the trailer door slowly, only a crack. Other people were sitting or squatting where they’d stood while shooting. Some were lying down, propped up on their elbows, talking, blowing on coffees. He’d managed to bring the whole place to a standstill. He returned to the sink. Splashed water on his wrists. Forced his head back on. Felt the infrastructure of heat kick in again. 

Outside, the director was waiting for him. Michael, have you got a sec? Sure. He spoke too quietly, the mics now off, his voice muffled by blue. Michael? Could you maybe lose the head? Took it off. Lowered his eyes. You okay to talk for a sec? Yeah, yep. My trailer, give me five minutes. 

Michael spotted Bex and Jo performing one of their rituals as they walked. Reading aloud each other’s horoscopes, as foreseen by a newspaper mystic with a stern haircut. They’re probably fucking each other, Gio had said more than once, opening his fingers into scissors, jamming them together. Don’t you think they’re fucking each other? 

Michael wasn’t quick enough to dodge their approach. Bex’s face already darkening, excited by the prospect of her new complaint: couldn’t it make you horny, to be so wrapped up in woe! Maybe they were fucking after all. 

Another late night was it Michael? Bex looked at Jo, not for support but to confirm their shared conspiracy. Not really. As Bex spoke, her wide stomach bumped his, missing the sensation of touch but not its force. He swayed. Remembered, with inventive shame, the LSD-laced Diana stamp he’d consumed the night before. You know, Bex went on, what can you even do on a Tuesday night? I wasn’t out. Fine, whatever, just get it together so we can leave at a decent time. I’m doing what I can out there. Sure you are. Thanks for the pep talk. Just get it together, please. Well now that you’ve asked so nicely. Bex frowned. Jo remained silent. A pair of nesting dolls, he thought, small shoulders emerging from brightly colored shells. They left, shaking their heads a few paces in, assuming they knew well what they did not. Even if they’d guessed he was gay, their impression would be limited, censored just as things started to get exciting. 

Michael reached for the newspaper they’d ditched in the bin, hinging forward. The front page dedicated a small column to the destinies of the Brexham Seven. No custodial sentences, the lede mourned. But the journalist was wrong about no lesson learned. It was simple: if you were going to make a gay sex tape, it had to be a cozy version, just the two quite ordinary cocks. Any more, or any prettier, and it was a crime! The journalist was in lambasting mode, wondered how seven people would even self-govern in a bed, across a carpet, up against a wall. There would probably be another celebration back at the George later. Perhaps they’d show the original footage of the Brexham Seven, the total sum of limbs. He’d like to see their faces. All that pleasure performed, their celebrity as yet unknown, though surely longed for, on whatever level. To look back at such footage and see yourself so alive! 

Michael found the horoscopes and turned to Virgo. Don’t try to hide your real feelings, your Love’s on show! Someone Special is bound to notice! Designed to make a person paranoid, Michael thought. The woman’s wide face floated beside the headline “This Week’s Predictions,” her fingertips touching a smoky purple globe. He’d like to read the director’s but had no clue about his birthday. He’d guess Capricorn, so he read accordingly: Positive moon and Venus bonding, get ready for Dreams to surface! The key word is Casual! And hadn’t Gio’s been a few weeks ago? At a pub dedicated to heterosexuals. The date made him a Leo. Michael scanned down. A fiery change is on the way! But H. is holding things up—you know what you need to do! Kill H., Michael supposed. 

The director’s trailer was in the neighboring field. This one parched by a hosepipe ban that did not apply to the set. Grass gone brown, a few dandelions clinging on, hedgerows crumpled. At least the light was softer, the sun operating at a normal degree of brightness. Beyond, up a shallow hill, were rectangles of rapeseed, somehow still yellow and resilient. 

Michael? The director stood on the steps, one hand on the door. Coming. Inside, a video game console, the smell of reheated food. No proper kitchen, but a microwave, a sink, a collection of dirty mugs. Michael noticed a small heap of black T-shirts across the back of the sofa. Welcome to my bachelor pad, well you know, not-a-bachelor pad. The director tapped his wedding ring. Can I get you anything? Water, please. God, Michael’s hangover had stamina. Taste of rust in his mouth, he couldn’t work up enough saliva to clear it.

The director sat on the sofa. How about his wife, Michael wondered, had she visited him here, in his trailer? No doubt she’d gone through his black T-shirts like a bloodhound, knowing clean from dirty. The thing about a normal life is that it’s very easy to imagine. Here, sit. Michael joined him, draining the water he’d been given. 

Do you want to take that off? Michael looked down at the slope of fur. It’s a little complicated I’m afraid. A few seconds passed as he arranged himself, the bulk of blue pressing into his crotch. The director widened his arms, as if Michael might suddenly slip to the floor, needing to be caught. You all good? Fine, yeah. More water? No, thanks, I’m fine. So, Michael. He turned to face the director at the sound of his name. The length of a forearm between them. What does this job mean to you? The director slid a hand along the back of the sofa, his fingers inches from Blue’s shoulder. It means a lot. I don’t believe you. The director adopted the tone of a schoolteacher, cushioning a hard sentence. I’m afraid I just don’t believe you. I’m sorry. Michael tried to identify the smell of the food. Something loose and meaty, a Bolognese, a steak pie. 

You can’t keep holding us up, it’s expensive, it’s disruptive. I know, I really am sorry. Michael could beg, that was something his body had an instinct for. He made a decision slowly, through the wet filter of last night’s escapades. It might be fated, if it came down to it, to blow the director, to follow the stern mystic right into the bulk of this Someone Special. It wasn’t so much the job he’d do it for, he reasoned, but himself. 

Michael leaned as close to the director as his costume allowed. This meant that he tipped forward, like a blue jug. If you give me another chance, I’ll step it up, I’ll do better, I love being here, it’s such a great job. A lot of people would love the chance. The director looked up at the ceiling and exhaled. A lot of people, they’d kill for the chance, this isn’t just any show, it’s the show, second-biggest ratings for 1997 and it looks like, for 1998, we’re going to be all the way at the top, between you and me. 

Last year, the show had been outdone only by Princess Di’s funeral, which, the director had said solemnly, was nobody’s fault. Michael looked at the stack of video games. One left open, the disc glowing inside the plastic, a name he wouldn’t recognize. 

With tenderness, Michael remembered Joan and Phil, the two Flemish giant rabbits once used in a few seconds of the show’s opening scene. Lazy under the bright lights, noses twitching with the kind of curiosity that Michael had failed to invoke. They hadn’t lasted long in the job. After only three or four turns at stardom, Phil had taken to mounting Joan just as the camera swiveled to find them. Both rabbits were bigger than the average toddler and just as vicious. It was too hard to keep separating them.

We value you, we do, Michael, we have these hiccups, but your tone, it’s perfect, you know that, don’t you? Michael had suspected he might be all right, that he’d managed to embody Blue in a way they hadn’t expected but liked. That was the second half of the job, recorded in a dingy London studio: Blue, Green, Purple, Red, working their voices up to impossible octaves. Not a real language but a unique series of exclamations. That maximalist childishness. Moods thrown great distances, operating across unreal binaries, ecstasy and devastation. Blue was soft, gentle. His voice could reach great heights, his particular grammar a frenzy of hums, of commas. 

Look, we have a solution for our little problem, anyway, that’s the good news, that’s what I wanted to tell you, yeah? We’re gonna give you a head start on the next episode, right here, right now. Michael felt a pulse of nausea, then nothing. 

The director moved across the room, flicking a pair of balled socks aside, the trailer vibrating with his footsteps. He opened a slim cupboard, an ironing board pinned to the door. The director pulled out an object and clawed through its wrapping. A large handbag, a familiar blue. Not leather, of course not, maybe vinyl. High shine, stiff handle. The director beamed. Placed it in Michael’s lap. Try it, see how it feels. The director stood with his legs too wide. Michael could smell the plastic, almost sugary. His reflection caught in the sheen. What do you think? 

Michael choked on his own thought and came up with a question. What star sign are you? The director barely reacted. Beg your pardon? What star sign are you? No clue. When’s your birthday then? Michael, can we focus here? Michael swallowed rust.

So there’s only a bag for me? What about Bex, or Jo? Ah well, you’re the chosen one, yeah? The director calculated an unknown equation, holding his chin in his hand. The chosen one? Sure, yeah. What will be in it, the handbag? Anything? The director frowned. Michael tried again. Well, what’s the motivation, I mean, in the plot, the next episode? Michael we’re not doing Ibsen, it’s just a fucking bag, you’ll see the bag, you’ll take the bag. Handbag, Michael corrected.

The director stretched, showing the daftest glimpse of skin. Could such heterosexuals not intuit a handbag? Delirious with ill-defined crisis, Michael had a brief fantasy of fainting. Falling into a textured heap. Skin, wire, metal, plastic, fur. The director digging through it all.

Okay. Listen, let me tell you a secret, Blue is the most popular character, he’s all the kids’ favorite, the teenies go wild for Blue, so if there’s a blue bag, they’re gonna want a blue bag too, you see? It’s all about you! Michael felt an urgent movement. Sorry, I’m sorry, is there a bathroom? The director deflated. Oh, yeah, sure, just through there. 

Past the microwave, door left open and light on, splattered with the director’s lunch. The bathroom was tiny. Michael unable to turn. Got to his knees, his blueness bumping the walls. Stayed upright, tried to control the aim of his mouth, torso already convulsing. He vomited sour liquid. Worried about the noise, the choke, that traveled up from his depths. Eyes streaming with the effort of it. He looked into the bowl and saw pulped yellow, the terrible consequences of tinned peaches dropped into fizzy wine. 

The pub had called the drink the Queen of Hearts. Frenzy of plastic tiaras and cycling shorts. Clip-on earrings crushed underfoot. The pierced-nipple man and his boring attempts at guessing what it was Michael did for a living. Race car driver, fireman, spy. When the punch line came, the man had taken Michael’s arm. He knew the show well, had a nephew who was utterly obsessed, you couldn’t tear him away. And you’re one of them! That’s so subversive! My God! The man had clapped. Sensing the horny opportunity of the political, Michael had played along. We love gay propaganda! We do! They had toasted. Why hadn’t Michael continued his subversion, committed to his gay propaganda, taken that nice man to a bathroom stall, removed the plastic tiara from his head, and placed it on his own?  

He got off the ground slowly, cleansed. Wiped his chin with a paw. Shuffled out backward, lowering the door handle with the costume’s hard edge, the loop of metal that extended the stomach. 

You all right? Yeah, great, sorry. Good, then get over here. The director led him to the wall opposite the cupboard. A full-length mirror hung, slightly wonky. The director was excited, spinning on the heels of his white trainers. Michael had left the head on the ground. He thought of the costume lady, her disciplining, and dusted the top dutifully. Put it back on, clicking the neck into place. The world shrank to the size of the slit. The director guided Michael’s paw through the bag’s handle. Michael shut his eyes. 

Do you have any children? Four, the director confirmed. Are you kidding? Michael asked the question quite seriously. Why would I joke about that? 

Michael had been a pretty child, he embraced the cliché of remembering such a thing, the present moment considered. Blue was a color he’d surely always liked. Hadn’t he had a little sailor’s outfit? A sky blue necktie? Or was that just a dream he’d once had. He’d definitely put on plays, directing his younger sister in two-person shows and forcing their family to watch, charging his older, stately cousins and blank-faced uncles a reasonable fee. He’d liked the weight of the twenty-pence pieces in his little sailor pocket.

What were the phrases? There’s more than one way to the top, that Wilde one about gutters and stars, something something showbiz. Wasn’t it just: Now that’s showbiz? 

Michael placed one large blue foot in front of the other, then turned, attempting a pirouette, the fur at his sides whipping gently. Celebrity could be thrust upon you. The key was to know what to do with it. The director released a fist pump. Yeah! That’s it! Now we’re talking, now we’re really talking, this’ll work great, I knew it. Michael kept turning, speeding up, letting his handbag set sail.

    "text": "I: I think we should begin today by informing the reader that there’s been a considerable break in time since we last met.

 

R: Why should we do that?

 

I: Well, I was thinking about how when we read a novel there’s no real record of the time in which it was written. The pages run so smoothly, are so ordered, we probably don’t put much thought to it. But since I’m talking to you as you build this novel, there’s an opportunity for the reader to know how long a novel takes and whether it’s written with or without interruption.

 

R: Some novels are written fast. I’ve heard people talk about writing as a fever dream. Once I was at a reading and this writer was saying he checks into a hotel and writes and drinks and, I imagine, eats shitty food until he’s done. I use writing to feel good, even if the subject of my writing is melancholy or dislocation. I love sublimation that feels like a very hot bath or the long runs I used to go on. Sometimes I do a stretch that is almost a split and it releases so many endorphins I start giggling. I have always wanted writing to feel that way.

 

I: Does that mean you don’t feel good when you’re not writing?

 

R: I feel good if my body and brain are engaged at the same time. I like to hike even though Danielle makes fun of me because I don’t see anything while we’re hiking. She’s stopping every few feet to take videos of woodland ephemera or water rushing down the same creek or just me leaning on my stick waiting for her to be done taking a picture of me leaning on my stick. I told her the other day, “I durate,” which is obviously not a real word, but I mean “I experience duration while hiking.” That’s the thing I’m doing most. Although I am very aware of the fragile trees in our forest; a new one falls every day, it seems, and now hangs in the crook of another tree that is soon to fall. I always miss the first sighting of the trout lily or the bounty of usnea, but it’s hard to miss the skunk cabbages when they return to the forest …

 

I: So do you mind if I say how long it’s been since we met?

 

R: Sure. Fuck it.

 

I: When I first suggested we should tell the reader how much time had passed, it had been only a couple of months. But since you were telling me about hiking with Danielle, five years have passed. It’s phenomenal.

 

R: How do I even begin to account for the past five years? As pertains to this novel, something kind of extraordinary happened. I think the first time we met to discuss my lesbian novel was the spring of 2018, and I’d just finished reading Naomi Alderman’s Disobedience and Fiona Shaw’s Tell It to the Bees. I can’t remember how I’d gotten there, but I’d been on a foray through lesbian fiction—I’d also read Doris Grumbach’s Chamber Music and probably a Sarah Waters book.

I realized that people who write literature (me included) are not comfortable with leaving people in a well-nourished and happy place. It’s not complex enough. It seems to suggest that all your questions have been answered. The women in Tell It to the Bees get run out of town. Rachel Weisz’s character in the book version of Disobedience is a player; she just walks away from the other Rachel. Chamber Music is a beautifully written book dominated by a wife and a nurse taking care of a brilliant though ill man, who don’t get together until after the husband dies, and then one of them dies! So, I was like, I’m going to write my own fucking lesbian romance, and when you finish reading it these women are going to be together and happy and sexy!

The funny part is, I had no idea there was a lesbian romance genre of Happily Ever Afters, HEAs—like, hundreds of books, so many that I didn’t even need to go back to Rita Mae Brown or to the nineties, when many of them emerged, because they were being written now and profusely so. However, I didn’t discover this until the fall of 2018, and for some reason, once I did, I could no longer write this novel.

 

I: Because you could get the hit of a happy ending without having to write one?

 

R: Perhaps, initially. I accepted an artist residency in Berlin for 2019. Went there and didn’t sleep for a year. It was so noisy. I just stayed up all night reading, then stumbled around during the day, sitting on benches in old cemeteries, sometimes meeting up with people but largely walking the city on my own trying to figure out who I was in Europe. By the fall of 2019, I’d become a scholar.

 

I: What does it mean to be a scholar?

 

R: It means I knew all the tropes. I’d read hundreds of books. Could name the popular authors. I learned a lot about what femme lesbians wear, according to these authors. The kinds of heels a high-fashion lesbian would wear. I learned how much people who are not writing experimental novels have their characters eat pizza and watch TV. It was like getting a tour through a kind of living that had eluded me before. I was always weird—even as a kid—living a weird life. And although I would argue I have a great capacity for emotional response (in certain conditions), reading these books somehow taught me about the little things. It’s weird, because I should have known them, but I think maybe I was cynical toward them.

 

I: Can I ask what you learned?

 

R: In better novels, I learned how people like to be consoled. I learned all the ways a person can get their feelings hurt inadvertently, how the hurt blooms and, if they’re not consoled, which most of the time isn’t because the other person doesn’t realize what they’ve done, what they’ve said or not said, how that leads to a great misunderstanding. I detest this … device? In romances. Hate it. I abhor communication drama—people misunderstanding each other, not being honest, not asking questions, acting out of fear.

 

I: But isn’t that the bones of any kind of story?

 

R: I don’t care, I hate it. When people start acting stupid I usually stop reading. Those people aren’t ready to be characters yet. You can’t have just any figment be a character. They should have to pass a test.

 

I: I think the argument is that novels are a space for growth and transformation; we are on a journey with a protagonist, rooting for them to figure their world out, make good choices.

 

R: Nah.

 

I: That’s your response? There’s no way you’re against transformation.

 

R: I am not. But you’re not supposed to be stupid when you start the journey, especially not if you’re a protagonist in a romance. Okay, let me give you an example. I read this book some years ago; it was about a straight woman who is a born-again Christian dating a born-again man. He’s annoying and controlling, so there’s no way the reader feels any sympathy for him; we’re there to see her find a more open love. Anyway, I think she starts a new job and immediately begins to fall for her boss, who is an Ice Queen. But they have some kind of weird angry energy between them that already has my hackles … What is it that hackles do? Whatever it is, I’m already pretty sure I don’t like these characters. There’s also an age gap, although with both MCs being so immature, this is a nonfactor. So, born-again lives with a roommate, someone she’s been friends with for a long time, and the roommate likes to sleep around. Somehow the roommate encounters her friend, the born-again, with the Ice Queen boss and sees there’s something brewing between them. Are you with me?

 

I: Yes, I think so …

 

R: Good. Almost done. The promiscuous friend asks the born-again if she’s interested in her boss, and, as in any romance, the born-again says no, but obviously she’s lying. The Ice Queen is annoyed that the born-again is born again and straight. I actually don’t remember her motivation for doing the horrendously stupid thing she’s about to do. So, the Ice Queen decides it’s a good idea to seduce the promiscuous roommate, go back to the roommate’s place, which she shares with the born-again, I remind you, instead of her own presumably luxury apartment, and have loud sex with the roommate, knowing that the person she’s actually interested in can hear them. That’s only the first of a series of unethical decisions these characters make. This was the first time it occurred to me that not every character is ready to be in a book. That doesn’t mean I don’t want to have an emotional experience; I just don’t want to be wrung out because two people don’t have enough respect for themselves and those around them to act bravely, or at least to feel remorse when they don’t.

 

I: What do you love?

 

R: In the genre?

 

I: Yes, as a scholar/enthusiast.

 

R: Well, there’s this one novelist who doesn’t do breakups and misunderstandings, which I deeply appreciate, and whose MCs have a lot of past trauma—usually injuries, emotional or physical—and get paired up with someone who, at one or two points in the story, lifts them off the ground or pulls them into their lap. Carries them when they are hurting. I am a sucker for women carrying each other around. So much of our pain is that old—where we could have been lifted and cradled by a caretaker and weren’t. I love it. It pulls all my strings.

The shifter romance is probably my favorite. I love wolves and dragons. Wolves more, because they are very protective, and they growl even in their human form when they sense arousal from their mate or when someone is threatening their mate. I also love a fake marriage trope. I love romances that take place on farms where there are many animals, especially horses and goats.

 

I: Any others you want to share?

 

R: I’m not sure I want people to know how thoroughly mushy I can be. How will I live down exposing this utter need I have for lesbian love stories? Look, it’s totally spilled over into my literary life. Made a mess of my autobiography.

 

I: Do you know how you will begin your novel, or return to what you started?

 

R: This reminds me of the question Xavière Gauthier asks Marguerite Duras in Woman to Woman, their book-length compilation of five interviews. Although perhaps it’s more like “How can one begin?” Or the video of an interview Muriel Spark gave where someone asks her how she writes her books and she says something like “First I write my name. No, first I write the title and then I write my name.”

 

I: So … ?

 

R: Girl, I don’t know!

 

I: I recall that your protagonist was June, an architect. There was something about a woman she met in London. Where is June now inside the novel? I mean, where has she been all this time? Is she still with her boyfriend, Ellis?

 

R: I’m almost afraid to go and see. What if the book has vanished entirely in the time I’ve been away?

 

I: We’re here. We’re still talking. So June is probably somewhere too.

 

R: Umm … that’s a good perspective. Let’s see.

 

“Something is stirring in me. Has been for months now, since Ellis and I were in London. Ellis says I’m a ferry moving full steam away from him and he’s kicking himself because he should have noticed before I ended up in the middle of the sea. He says it’s dark and the sea is churning from the ferry’s engines, so he can’t even see me anymore. “Where was I when you set sail?” he keeps moaning.

I have said yes to accompanying Marcel to the Gego retrospective at the G. He thinks I’m obsessed with circles. I am in love with moons, spheres, but I don’t tell him that. When we go, it’s a quiet afternoon. The show has been open for a couple of months and the city is hot and sleepy. Esther will meet us later for a coffee, but in the meantime, we are traversing the spiral, though at different speeds and on different levels. I am moving so slowly I’m not sure I’ve even begun taking in the show. I’m thinking about all the negative space in Gego’s wire sculptures, everything unsaid. My phone buzzes with a message from Marcel:

       Move your butt!

Followed by another:

       For real. What’s wrong? Why are you staring at the floor?

       Me: I’m thinking about space like we’re supposed to be doing.

“You’re thinking about space?” A low voice interrupts my search for the perfect emoji.
       “Did I say that out loud?” I ask, turning to take in the intruder. For the moment, we have one of Gego’s Square Reticulária to ourselves.
       “You did, but I’m not disagreeing. Did you want to finish that?” She nods toward my phone. I add “smssshi” quickly and send the text, because I want Marcel to know that everything has changed. I turn back to this woman, trying to figure out how to tell the truth. “I have this feeling in me that every time I see you—” But then I stop. “Not sure how to complete that thought.”
       “So, you do remember me?” She looks less confident than she did a moment ago.
       “It’s not so much remembering as it is a stirring-up of strange weather when our paths cross. And I know the feeling comes from the past, but I can’t grasp it.”        The smirk is back. “Isn’t that just an existential way of saying you don’t remember?”
       “Not when your moon is in Virgo.”
       “What happens when your moon is in Virgo?”
       “You want order and, if it’s not too much to ask, to hear that click of everything sliding into place.”
       Then her soft laugh is rolling through me.
       “Do you want me to tell you how we know each other?”
       “Not in this climate! I’m not sure I can handle it.”
       Smiling, she says, “Okay. I’ll wait but I need to get your number or something.”
       “You’re going to call me?”
       “I’m going to text you and ask you to meet up for coffee.”
       “Are you British?”
       “When I’m looking out a window or walking somewhere.”
       Now it’s my turn to smile, which I do shyly.

I: What’s the British woman’s name?

 

R: Umm … do I know?

 

I: Well, did she type anything into June’s phone?

 

R: I have no idea. I haven’t checked yet. Honestly, I can’t remember the name I dreamed up for her, and I can’t find my notebook where I wrote out my first thoughts about the novel. There’s the mention in my journal from 2017, but it’s just me saying enthusiastically that I’m on page thirteen. Where the hell is the other notebook? I started the novel by hand in one journal and took notes in another—but not in my normal journal, where I wrote about writing? And not in the journal where I was exchanging letters with Danielle?

There’s a small chance I was waiting to name her until she became a full presence in the novel, as if June needed to first understand the value of the British woman’s existence before I allowed myself to see her fully, or it would be near simultaneous: June would know, then I would know. But why didn’t I write this out in one of my journals? I know you think I’m obsessing.

 

I: Can’t you just name her anything?!

 

R: Okay. Let me see …

 

We are all in high-stress mode with the Detroit House; I’ve been staring at these digital blueprints of the roof for hours. Something is missing. It sort of feels like that everywhere. Ellis is always missing these days. In Singapore this week. Esther is on a research trip. Marcel is in the studio. I don’t want to see anyone else, anyone new to whom I’d have to explain where I go in the middle of conversations.

  A message chime. I know it’s Griffin with the fifth reminder this morning of our meeting tomorrow, but I look anyway and lose my breath when I see it’s the woman from London. I haven’t heard from her since our run-in at the G ten days ago. I’d be lying if I said she hasn’t been on my mind. She’s been everywhere. On all my surfaces. What the hell?

         Thena: Hi June. I wonder where you are on this gorgeous day. The humidity is low. A perfect day to sit somewhere and get to know a person. Are you free?

Breathing is not more important than the stillness my body needs to keep my heart in my chest. My reaction to her text is completely unreasonable. A thrill overtakes my nervous system. Am I that lonely?

         Me: How did you know I needed a reason to step away? I’m working but I could use a break.

         Thena: You want the truth or something more socially acceptable?

         Me: I don’t even know how to respond to that.

         Thena: Come meet me. I’ll send you a pin. East side or west?

         Me: West, uncrowded.

         Thena: Will do.

Who is this woman? She is an absolute question mark. But one I seem to be moving toward—I’m throwing shit into my bag, stuff I want to show her for some odd reason. Perhaps it’s just the idea of meeting a new artist, one from a city whose architectural history goes back so much further than this one, a city with secret underground rivers—although it’s true Manhattan has its own lost rivers. We don’t often talk about what we can’t see.

  I find her an hour later on a flat rock perched over the Hudson.
       “I was worried you weren’t coming.”
       “I should have told you I live near Union Square.”
       “Oh. Oops.”
       “No. No big deal. I like to relocate.”
       “I like your sneakers,” she says. “And your hair. That shirt. Your earrings. And your pocket protector.”
       I can’t believe she noticed my protector.
       “Sorry.” She sort of chuckles and sighs at the same time. “I’m nervous.”
       “Do your friendships usually begin so mercurially?”
       She reaches out an arm and helps me up onto the rock. I’m so glad the heat’s let up enough that we can be with the water like this. I wonder which of the rivers I should tell her about first.
       “I’m not sure I’ve ever started a friendship with someone I’ve met before but who doesn’t remember me.”
       “I do remember you, Thena. But when I reach for specifics, it’s all weather—fog, wind, tumult.” I’m breathless.
       “Tell me something I need to know about you,” she says with her gaze pointed at the water.
       “Okay. I have a boyfriend. His name is Ellis. He’s in finance and travels a lot. When we were in London, he worked all day and I walked the streets, saw as much art and architecture as I could.”
       “You’re an artist?”
       “I’m a builder.”
       And then, as if the words had just reached her, “You have a boyfriend?”
       “Yes … traveling … Ellis.”
       We sit with the quiet between us for a long while. I’m watching things come in and out of sight on the horizon. She turns to look at me. I hadn’t really meant to invite study. I want to remember to ask her about her art. I see specks of paint on her knees. She’s wearing cutoff shorts and a big linen shirt.
       “I like your necklace,” she says so quietly I am reading her lips more than hearing her voice.
       “Will you tell me something?” I ask hesitantly because I’m not sure what I can handle knowing about this woman. She’s very beautiful. Her voice is raspy but also proper. Then occasionally something else, something more street-level. I want to ask her a question that takes her a long time to answer, so she forgets she’s speaking and starts using her hands. And then I realize she’s already talking, and I’ve missed most of it.
       “… I could go up or lean over. It wouldn’t matter to me,” she finishes, with something too bright to hold rushing toward me.
 

I: Well done.

 

R: Thank you.

 

I: How do you feel?

 

R: Like I need to stare up into the trees for a long time. That’s how I think.

 

I: What do you need to think about?

 

R: For one, dialogue. Is it okay to simply render June and Thena’s speech, or is it better to support their exchange with “I said” and “she said”; should I build an environment or a choreography around their speaking with observations like “Thena turns to gaze at the water, returns her eyes to me,” or “Thena looks as if she has more to say”? There’s also something deeply literal in romance, something brought over from real-life situations that I think is actually hard to achieve in real life, which is probably why there are romances in the first place. For example, a character in a romance is often more likely to catch fleeting emotions as they cross another’s face. Sometimes the characters discuss these feelings; other times it’s a secret between the narrator and the reader. What I’m saying is that feeling itself, the experience of feeling, is given a kind of presence in romances that is almost phenomenological. The organic response to embarrassment in the romance, for example, is to extend the moment, observe all its nuances: a character stares at her hands folded in her lap; she blushes; she goes to speak and her voice cracks; tries again, utters some apologetic words. The other person goes to console, offers encouragement, maybe experiences a swelling of warmth in their chest (that’s usually the beginning of some love feeling), or they fail to meet the moment, change the subject. It’s a whole drawn-out thing and nothing else matters until we get to the other side of it.

 

I: Most of your work has some romantic or sexual aspect to it, even if only minutely. Can you talk about how else what you’re doing here differs from what you’ve done before?

 

R: Did I already say that the large majority of books in the lesbian romance genre are poorly written? This is the case for hetero and other queer romances, too. It’s an asshole thing to say but no less true. The genre does not regard language as a living force, as an inhabitable space, a space for encounter. Rather, each sentence tends to be treated as if it were a sharp-edged container with one function. Like: make a point. Or: explain. Or: dramatize. They go: “I drove home.” “We looked at each other with heat in our eyes.” “Doug nodded.” “Bess was puzzled.” “After everything that happened yesterday, Morgan knew what she needed to do.”

I try to avoid writing things I don’t want to write. “Mary opened the refrigerator door to remove the chicken that had been marinating all morning. She grabbed the dish with her hand and pulled it toward herself. She turned and placed it on the table and went back for the salad greens she’d pair with the meat”—such a detailed description of an action is not only unimportant to what is happening in the story but also very uninteresting because it’s very easy to imagine those actions without them being serenaded to us. I mean, the one thing I can picture in my life is pulling shit out of the fridge. I think people justify that kind of narration by saying “I’m building the scene” or “This is backstory.” But I want neither to read these actions in other people’s books nor to write them in my own. If I don’t, though, my novel will be ten or twenty pages long! There are things that are hard for me to do fictionally, things that bore me and feel unnecessary, and there are things that are hard but must be done. Like June and Ellis. I owe it to the novel to show the dissolving of that relationship, but having to do so feels like those days in middle school when I had to drag my soul out of bed to go do this horrendously asinine thing within this dubiously constructed frame, which, in this case, was childhood.

 

I: Will you enact the breakup in the novel?

 

R: Ugh. Do I have to?

 

I: We were always taught “Show, don’t tell.” Although I realize that the essence of what you’re doing here is telling. We can’t really get around that. Do you mind if we return to the book for a minute? Where are we with June?

 

R: You’re going to think this is random, but I was reading this article on ESPN yesterday, about a running back who plays for one of the New York teams. He’s waiting for a big contract, but the team is stalling for whatever reason. I’m thinking about it because someone was interviewing him about the negotiations, and these guys are so much in the spotlight; they’re expected to answer questions but are also pressured by their agents or teams not to give too much away—this is rhetoric; you normally have to go to graduate school to do this well—so they end up speaking in platitudes or clichés. That’s really all digressive. I just want to share this moment when the running back is answering a question about how the talks are going. He says, “I think at the end of the day, if you really break it down and look at it as a whole, there is no rush.” That if you really break it down and look at it as a whole … oh man, I love that. That’s what we’ve got to do with June: break her down so we can see her whole.

 

Something about Thena makes me want to fall to my knees and take her sex into my mouth, even though I’ve never done that before. I want her to destroy my face with friction and wetness and whatever else she’s got. I love the way her vulva gleams with arousal, and I just want to get inside—
 

I: Whoa! Whoa! Jesus Christ. Just hold up a moment. How did we get here?

 

R: Oh, too much?

 

I: I mean, what’s going on? Is she dreaming?

 

R: Okay. Let me back up.

I find the courage to message Thena. I haven’t seen her in a couple of weeks, but she keeps showing up in my sentences. Mostly in things I say to Esther; sometimes, though, she comes out at work. I’m as shocked as anyone when I say at this morning’s meeting, “Thena would draw this line thusly.” Part of my surprise is due to the authority of my tone—how is it that I think I know what her lines would do? Even if I did know Thena’s lines intimately, they don’t belong in or near the Detroit House. Everyone’s looking at me when, for the third time this week, I open my mouth and say, “Thena … ” Griffin texts me as everyone turns their attention back to the slideshow. “Take five, June. And by that I mean five hours.” Griffin gives me an idea. Instead of treating my brain like an intruder or a mutinous landscape, today—and today only—I’ve decided to read it literally. I look at it head-on and it’s just covered in placards that read “Thena, Thena” and sometimes “THENA.” So I’m going to go with that: call Thena, text Thena, move toward Thena somehow. I choose to text.

       Me: Hi. How is your world?

I’ve relocated to a café across from my office. It takes eleven minutes for her to respond.

       Thena: Hey beautiful. Whatever it was, it isn’t any longer.

       Me: Are you working? Do you have a studio?

Why don’t I know this? How have I asked her nothing about her art? I try to be patient. It’s been forty-five seconds.

       Thena: Not really. I’m a bit of a nomadic artist. Then it strikes me that I don’t know where she lives. I have forgotten that I met her in London, that she just showed up here. Is her stay in New York temporary? I realize I’ve spent too long working my way through this when she texts.

       Thena: Wrong answer?

I’m on it.

       Me: No, I’ve just realized that I don’t know how long you’ll be here.

       Thena: In the city?

       Me: Yeah.

       Thena: That depends.

       Me: On what?

Also, wait! Did she call me beautiful? I have to scroll up to check. Yes, it says, “Hey beautiful.” Was she talking to me?

       Me: It’s June by the way.

       Thena: LOL

       Me: Well, I don’t know. Maybe you haven’t saved my number.

       Thena: I have saved everything.

Okay. My brain shuts down momentarily. By the time it restarts, I’ve missed a few texts. She wants to meet up.

       Me: I think I’m ready to hear about London.

I write this and am suddenly flush with heat.

       Thena: Okay. We can do that, too.

Too? Did I miss something? I’m sure I did.

       Thena: Come to me. I will cook you dinner.

And I sit there for a while kind of exploded.

       Thena: Will you come to Brooklyn?

We make arrangements, after which I toss my phone into my bag, then drop my bag to the floor, then place my foot on top of it.
 

I: There’s no way June’s about to go to Thena’s house and … what did you say, “fall to her knees”? It’s too soon.

 

R: What’s happened to this interview?

 

I: Sorry. It’s just suddenly you’re rushing, and I don’t understand why.

 

R: Well, this is the time in the novel when the narrative begins to turn toward the finish. I mean, there’s still some work to do, but once our protagonist starts to realize she can no longer contain her feelings, the ball really gets rolling.

 

I: I get it. But there are a couple of things I think we should discuss first.

 

R: Like what?

 

I: You wrote just now that June is sitting “kind of exploded” for a while. I wonder if you could talk about the ways in which the body stamps or shapes narrative time.

 

R: That sounds a bit theoretical.

 

I: You don’t think it’s important?

 

R: This is me narrowing my eyes at you. And you’re in luck because that is a common occurrence in the romances I read. You narrow to discern or to threaten, sometimes for snark or flirtation. There’s a lot about the eyes in general. People’s smiles not reaching their eyes. People’s faces being unreadable but their eyes revealing. In lighter novels, there’s a great deal of rolling of the eyes, which I like. A lot of dilation of the pupils upon arousal. Blue eyes growing dark before sex. Brown eyes resembling melted chocolate, usually with gold flecks. Not many people wear glasses in romances. Did you know that? And I’ve only read one book where an MC wears contacts, and that was only in the beginning. She was hiding her identity.

Most lesbian romances you’ll encounter feature white women, so it’s like I’m getting an extended education in how white women want and love and fight and communicate, fictionally. In these books, blushing is a kind of currency. Oh my god, there could be a catalogue for the different kinds of blushes there are, and upon which part of the upper body—the ears, cheeks, whole face, one ear, neck, chest—they blaze. The variations in color—fire red blushing, deep red, dusty pink, purple. It’s amazing. Blushing shows vulnerability, conveys desire or withholding. I have some small jealousy that my skin is too dark to communicate in this way. And then we have the core.

 

I: Yes, kind of a fundamental concept for many things.

 

R: True, but cores burn brightest in lesbian romances. They are both the site and the measure of arousal in the body. When a character starts to experience desire, it’s the core that lets them know it’s real. When a character says “Touch me” or “Please” or “Don’t stop,” they mean there’s a fire at the center of them. When a character says “Come for me” or “I’m coming,” there’s liquid in the core. Sometimes a lot. Sometimes it’s almost like they’re molten. And often, as is the case with the eyes, the core can overflow.

 

I: Are you done with the body?

 

R: Hmm. I should probably say something about lips and nipples. I am enamored with nipples in a romance. They come in so many different colors. When the core starts to ignite, the nipples can get very hard: nipples pebbling under thin shirts, hot mouths on nipples, nipples being tugged softly or roughly pinched, nipples brushing against other nipples.

It’s a matter of debate, when people talk about the degree to which a character gets wet, whether it’s fantasy or the author simply not understanding the contours of the experience. Meaning that sometimes you don’t know whether it’s because a man is writing the scene or because a character is fantasizing. For example, I’ll never forget this scene where these two women are having sex for the first time in the back of a limo. They are both “gushing” arousal, but they are also on their way to an event, so they’re wearing evening gowns and thongs. These thongs are filling up and the choreography is hot, but when they’re done, they just get out of the car and go to the party. No way, man. Can you imagine walking around in a soaking thong? And considering it’s a thong, let’s think about where all that liquid really is. It’s probably in their shoes by now.

Everybody also has full lips, and they can tongue for hours without needing to excuse themselves to vacate spit. I like when one or the other nips the bottom lip—either their own lip, in thought or hesitation, or their partner’s, in hunger.

What keeps me coming back, even though aspects of the romance formula drive me crazy, is that the people who write these stories understand how beautiful women are. And there is no more perfect way this gets demonstrated than through the narration of the orgasm. How lovingly and with such great texture writers, even bad ones, describe this moment of surrender. The back arches, the breath is held, the neck tilts back, the mouth opens, names are called out or moans erupt, limbs shake and seize up, sweat comes, the core empties; then bodies entwine, they start over or seek comfort, they rest, they grieve something or reach for something, then start again or sleep. It’s like a poem or a long paragraph or a drawing. An unfolding, folding line. Some of them go and go. I keep thinking I’m going to reach the end of wanting to read these stories. That I’ll fill up on these repeating story lines of people finding the one person or the found family that nourishes them, but here I am still eating.

 

I: Hello, by the way. It’s been a long time.

 

R: I had to go away for a minute after that exchange. I was kind of emptied out.

 

I: Where did you go?

 

R: We went to the woods.

 

I: You and Danielle?

 

R: Yep. It’s our usual. Red trail to the yellow trail, break at the mouth of the blue trail—eat an apple, catch our breath from the climb, swat flying things in the warmer months—then pick back up to finish the yellow, then finish the red.

 

I: Did Danielle see anything?

 

R: Apparently, the forest floor is alive. There are verdant pools full of wood frog eggs and salamander eggs. Purple violets. White violets. Wood betony. The skunk cabbage is huge. She stopped for a while to take a video of a fern, I believe. Picked up something and filmed it on her hand. We checked each other for ticks at every stop. They’re crazy this year. Found none. She told me to stop brushing against this one plant, which I hadn’t consciously touched. I got to use my knife. Had to cut an opening into an orange so I could peel it. Saw one large unidentifiable paw print. A couple of trees had fallen. What did you do?

 

I: I called someone I’d been thinking about and asked her if she’d meet me. It’s not a date.

 

R: Oh okay.

 

I: Are you smirking?

 

R: No. Of course not."

    "text": "I know a certain amount about sports, mainly baseball. Last night the Rangers won the pennant, for example, and I know what the pennant is. The thing my husband finds truly poetic is sports. He’s always trying to talk to me about it and explain. “Watch this play,” he keeps saying, and then explaining it. Without his explanations I don’t think I would appreciate the poetry in sports, though the concept is simple: it’s an arena for heroes and heroics. 

It’s also an arena for people who are grown men, and sometimes quite old men, who take a child’s game so seriously it’s as if they’re soldiers bound for battle zones in a war to fight for our ideals. My husband approaches sports with a level of dedication normally reserved for the enactment of international peace agreements, and a lot of men are like this. They experience weird levels of well-being at victory and existential despair at defeat. Maybe sports provide for them an alternate route to emotion without actual human interaction, a route to the realm of poetics and sensibility without having to read a poem or have a sensibility.

Jack is a conundrum. I am the perfect wife for him since I have no needs and am easily suffocated and am not suffocating. Maybe I’m not needy enough. Men like needy women. Damsels in distress. 

The worst things that happen, you don’t see them coming. That’s what makes them the worst. One of the vagaries of age is a loss of the ability to see or detect things that are right in front of you. Usually it’s when you’re cooking and you can’t find the oregano. But this is a metaphor with a bigger meaning—like when you don’t notice that your husband has turned into a Hieronymus Bosch painting.

“There is something worse than knowing the worst. It is not knowing,” wrote Walker Percy. Yes, it is unsettling to discover that the man you love is not the one you thought he was—or the one he never was, but you embroidered him into a vast ideal, and you can’t change your entire personality in one instant and stop embroidering people into vast ideals. But there is one good side to disillusionment. At least you’re in the real world after that, jolted out of your pathetic stupor. Like welcome to the world, the normal world of disillusionment. The loss of my ideal of him seems almost paltry in comparison. 

Like Dante, lost in a dark wood in the middle of the journey of our life, you weren’t paying attention. You were so inattentive that you didn’t notice your husband had turned into a Hieronymus Bosch painting. (Just take a close look at a Hieronymus Bosch painting if you’re wondering what I mean.)

When I learned of his transgression I threw myself into Dante and Shakespeare, seeking to understand the world that I had failed to see. I couldn’t decipher it without a guide, so I took classes. The classes were at Georgetown. I tried not to talk in class because my contributions were inappropriate, but the other oldsters (auditors) talked so then I did too. The kids stuck purely to the text and the question at hand, as did the oldsters. Whereas when I talked it was all about My Personality, not just Shakespeare. That’s why I’m always cringing in retrospect about my ego disorder. 

The villains in Shakespeare had always upset me. Often the villain comes out on the stage first off and confides his evil plan (Iago, Richard III). So the audience has to squirm in teeth-gnashing hatred of the villain for the rest of the play while his innocent victims are destroyed. Or wait a minute—maybe it’s their innocence that is the agent of their destruction. Their inability to read his heart, see him for who he is. 

This inability to face bleak truths is a great source of trouble. I for example conveniently overlooked the fact that I was an ass or that Jack was not a god or that she whom I held dear was capable of stark betrayal. I had never met a Shakespearean villain before personally. The fault of my inviolable innocence—the crack she got in through.

Are there really such women? Desdemona asks.

How oddly innocent she is, said the professor.

That was me exactly.

“How do you deal with your despair at Iago’s perfidy?” I asked in class. “It’s so depressing.”

Answer: Blank silent stares.

One day I volunteered inanely, “I am exactly like Desdemona and Othello wrapped up into one, so Shakespeare is teaching me to change and be less stupid.” In Shakespeare class I continued to encounter my essential nature, one that must be delivered in tortured public proclamations. My flaws. My woes. My uncanny resemblance to Don Quixote (embroidering everything into vast ideals). 

The kids in the class were adorable. If you idealize someone, said one kid, you’ll never do anything for them, because they’re like a fake statue. If you idealize someone they can never be who you think they are. 

I did learn that, at least. At least then I could look at Jack without embroidering him into a vast ideal and actually just find out who he is. And on the rare occasions when I could do that I saw this: he needs to be nurtured. Hideously, someone else had to do it when I didn’t. 

While reevaluating his personality I noticed he’d done things that Tony Soprano did. Tony wanted to buy a house on the shore, as he plainly told Carmela, “to keep the family together.” It would be a draw for the kids and their friends. Which is what Jack said when he bought the beach house. So is that who Jack is? Tony Soprano?

You think it’s all about ethics at first. You’re the guy in the shroud with the long white beard, carrying the sign that says REPENT. You’re a Florentine fanatic in the fifteenth century about to immolate herself for her obsessive opposition to sin. Or maybe it’s the pope who decides she should be immolated in flames. I’m not sure. 

There is one key bit in the Day of Atonement service that is alien to my ideals (and eminently dear to Jack): they want you to atone for your sins, presuming indubitably that you will sin. The weakness is expected. The evil is presumed. That’s weird. You’re not just some uncontrolled amoeba swimming around the universe. Are you?

In God’s eyes all men are sinners. It sounds like a Hank Williams song. This is humanity. These are the sinners. God loves them too. In fact God loves them more. But the straight shooters have to be stronger. 

You think you must fight back. Draw your sword. But what will you fight? You should surrender your innocence, not fight for it. Yet my innocence kept unintelligently advancing like the soldiers at Gallipoli, as if directed by remote uncourageous generals. 

The absurd advance continued as I drove home from class. A hard rain slashed into the swaying trees. The traffic was gridlock and the temperature was ninety-nine degrees, although it was October.




Then there was Dante. Although Dante seems like a moralist, our professor thought the Inferno was more about the psychology of sin than the nature of evil. There is also the psychology of the blessed, not only of the damned. Dante is looking for redemption. Thus, after traversing the depths, he reaches the heights:

“And then we came forth again to see the stars.” 

Not as ecstatic as Paradise. But you came to the other side.

Dante has compassion for the sinners. In the end you come to that, or else it’s curtains. You have to look at what it must be like to be married to you. It must be annoying. You look at all the angles. It must be that he had never loved me quite as I loved him. That would be another angle, a bleak truth to face, to account for his behavior. 

The old idolatry, or is it gratitude, or merely the ability to love … I still feel it, thank God. Despite the disillusionments, which were so ordinary and ineluctable. I was glad of them, I was deficient without them, something was missing without them. The curtain rose, a veil removed that had obscured the scene whose meaning now could be revealed: treachery, corruption, that my idols could fall. I was grateful that the veil over such basic knowledge was finally lifted to recalibrate my soul.

So I drove home one evening in a humid twilight when the classes were over. But the straight way was still lost. It was easy to get lost in Washington. That was another thing about the District. One false move and you were in Virginia. You practically had to have ESP to find your way around the traffic circles amid the statues of generals on horseback facing certain directions to express defeat or victory. 

But there is a reason why everyone keeps getting lost in Washington. It was designed to confuse the enemy. I had an enemy now.




Winter was coming, as they say in Game of Thrones. In some places downtown there were soldiers wearing fatigues. Some said they couldn’t discuss their mission. Others said they would go to Korea if there was a war. I went past the embassy of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, a fascinating crumbling palazzo. Mysterious caravans often drove past, creating paranoid Washington moments with black SUVs and studiously nondescript square-jawed men talking tensely into their secret earphones. 

The pope was in town, causing huge traffic jams. The pope seemed to follow me wherever I went. Maybe because of the shroud.

Adelaide came home from college for Thanksgiving.  “I feel so sorry for the turkeys,” she said. “Just let the turkeys live.” 

 “Your compassion for the turkeys is very beautiful but I’m cooking one. I have to read the directions. It takes hours.” Grace cooked a pasta dish for lunch while we were waiting. 

“I loved the pasta, Grace,” I kept saying over and over. “Let me tell you how much I enjoyed the pasta,” I continued. “This pasta you made is exquisite.” 

“Mom you’re driving me crazy.” 

So the holiday was gotten through, Adelaide went back for her last semester of college, and Grace prepared to navigate her last year of high school while simultaneously conducting her wastrel youth. And I looked for opportunities to discuss the crisis when I was alone with Jack, or to find out what I did not know by what I did—like the Duke of Wellington standing on the hill. 

Then I had to do my Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts. As instructed by the shrinks. 

But in the end I fled to New Orleans to escape the winter and the pain and the cause of the pain: Jack. One story is of the woman who leaves and doesn’t worry about whether he’ll come after her. I guess that’s what was happening then. Only when you give up hope are your hopes realized. Or—the only way to suffer less is to love less?




My father had a mental crisis in Italy in 1954, after his soul received the shock from which it never fully recovered. 

“He went around like a zombie for years,” said the transgressor, my mother. 

There is a striking similarity about our lives in this respect—my father’s and mine. 

I sympathized instantly with my mother, that is not the tragic part, but that my father took it so hard. His ability to be consoled by Latin fricatives and Greek macros (whatever those are) developed then, driven by the heartache he never got over. For me it was Dante and Shakespeare. For him it was ancient Greek and peat stacks and stuccators. 

Whenever I flew into New Orleans a terrible storm would start about forty-five minutes before landing. Occasionally a glimpse of the Mississippi River glittering under the black storm clouds was illuminated by a flash of lightning. My father gave me some Homer to read to calm me down when I got home. I thought of my mother: it was her birthday. My father said he was well aware of the day. 

“In many respects she was a wonderful person,” he said.

Gee, could you be any less qualified or enthusiastic, I mean, this is the woman you were married to for forty years.

“But you know my story.”

It was now my story also, though I did not confide this truth to my father. Usually a girl becomes her mother. I became my father—the sternness, the innocence, the shock. He did not know my story, though I knew his. My mother told me about it when I was twenty-five. 

In her effects I later found a note he wrote to her parents on June 11, 1953: “Claire flew off today to spend 6 weeks in the tropics for a rest cure in Nassau.” I also found the adoring letters he wrote to her while she was there. The adoring letters are not dated. Which was striking since I knew him as one to insist that every article of writing be prefaced by the date. 

It was while he was writing these adoring letters that it happened: the cataclysm in his life by which he would thenceforward date all things. Everything thereafter must be dated to record the passage of events, the sequence of their history. As one must then begin, patiently and painfully, as he had learned in the army, to “appreciate the situation.” 

The similarities are so curiously exact in some respects—his trusting adoring love. How I used to idolize Jack.

Tears were streaming down my face silently as I stood behind my father while having this strangely apropos conversation. He was at his desk, showing me the bookplate designed for him by a New Orleans architect in 1954. I asked him to explain its elements. 

His Latin motto, which he translated as “Persevere, it suits you,” was the rubric above the design. The exact translation is: “Persevere, it is fitting, for a better fate awaits the afflicted.” My father’s translation is more suave, the other more exact. The line is from Virgil, the Aeneid.

This was the motto he adopted after the heartache he never got over. I wanted to confide in him, to teach him that there are explanations and that understanding can be sought. He never forgave her. He said he didn’t. But they lived together for the next forty years until he took her through the door to heaven. 

“I don’t think you could have done that if you didn’t love her,” I said.

“My father helped me,” he said. “He knew my story. He gave me his advice.” 

“What did he say?”

“This is a test of your character.” 

An enigmatic comment.

Below the Latin motto on the bookplate there was a drawing of the best oyster he ever ate, on April 4, 1952. 

Below that were the sugarcane fields at Bayou Lafourche, to signify where his father was born and where his family began in Louisiana. 

His father was the last of nine children and led the family when they lost their parents. “Some boys are men before they turn twenty-one,” he said to his many brothers when that time came. “And that is what we must be.” He was ten years old. It was curious to have a boy of ten calling the shots, but Ever Anhalt was the family prodigy. He went to college when he was fourteen, the first in his family to go that far. He went to law school in the North three years later. 

In 1907 he returned to New Orleans to found the law firm DeGaullier & Anhalt. The clients were heavy hitters, including United Fruit, Coca-Cola, the Port of New Orleans, and the Louisiana Rice Milling Co. My father inherited these clients when, after serving overseas in World War II, he went to law school in the North and then returned to practice law beside his father, bringing home with him a Yankee bride. 

In the early fifties my father went to the site of the United Fruit operations once or twice and brought my mother, who had a fondness for the tropics. My mother, trained as a psychologist, always thought that people’s marriages were disintegrating and was always predicting disasters. Her predictions were always accurate. She knew the worst was coming. It would never surprise her. I always thought when she kept saying everything was disintegrating that it wasn’t, really. But of course it turns out that it is. Unraveling, like my father’s cigars. 

Things do tend to disintegrate in the tropics. She returned to Nassau periodically for her rest cures.




In my father’s possession is a very curious item. It’s an oyster diary, where he grades the oysters at the Pearl, a restaurant downtown, across the street from his office. He had lunch there every day. It starts in January 1954, and is plainly an attempt to come to grips with what he said was the hardest year of his life. Each entry is preceded by the date, which is followed by a terse description in a minuscule scrawl. It is the work of a madman.

 

Sept. 2 – awful

Sept. 7 – no good
Sept. 10 – terrible

Oct. 15 – marvelous
Oct. 16 – unbelievable
Oct. 17 – warned away
 

It goes on that way for twenty years. 

I did not tell my father of Jack’s transgression, but I told my stepmother, Amelia. She did not appear overtly shocked—and she would rather have been submerged in a vat of boiling oil than desert her defense of Jack. She was like an eighteenth-century Frenchwoman in a Balzac novel. She provided her weirdly outmoded spiel from another century: “Don’t show him how you really feel, don’t show anger, don’t drive him away, show him your strength, act totally serene.”

“I’m not a professional actress.”




You probably want some details. You want to hear the whole sordid story, maybe. It is too sad to tell. It is mentally nauseating. 

Here’s an analogy. When we moved to Washington there was a madman loose on the streets of Virginia. A sniper. He went to Maryland, he went to Virginia, he went to the District. To disperse his madness. You couldn’t think about it head-on, full frontal; you had to keep it at the side of your head like a gnat that you swat at occasionally. Otherwise you couldn’t cope.

The prurient details of this story are like that. 

We were in New York when he told me. It was early June. We were at a hotel. The palaces of Manhattan were all around us. Skyscrapers instead of greenery. It gave me the creeps. He said he had done something terrible. He put his head in his hands. There was a long, tortured silence. Finally he came out with it. 

At first the drama seemed unreal. Like when the teacher tells everyone to stop throwing the erasers and no one listens amid the uproar. And I’m usually the one who tells everyone to stop throwing the erasers. And there was no uproar. Unless it was the huge waves of my innocence crashing on the shore. 

It was so outlandish I kept thinking that he had a brain tumor causing temporary insanity.

“Does anyone else know?” I asked. Because other people close to us were involved.

“Yes. Our daughters.”

Jesus Christ. 

“How?”

“Grace asked to use my phone one day and discovered texts, she confronted me, she took pictures of the texts and sent them to Adelaide. Adelaide invited me to dinner in New York pretending everything was normal, acting super nice. When she walked into the restaurant there was a knife vibrating in the wall next to my head.” 

Speechless shock.  

“Are they able to forgive you?”

“Adelaide says she never wants to speak to me again unless it’s about logistics. Grace is more psychologically probing about it. But she made me tell you.”

A piteous collateral sorrow that a seventeen-year-old daughter on the brink of life had to make this discovery. Though if not for her psychological genius in making him tell me, my idiotic innocence would have been lifelong preserved.

The next morning I took the train back to Washington praying I would not run into Ivy when I got there. She and Albert lived in our neighborhood. The train was standing room only and would only go ten miles an hour. After crawling at ten miles per hour to Philadelphia I gave up and got out and went across the track and found another train, also standing room only, which was filled with an inordinate number of priests. 

Why are there so many priests on this train, I wondered, and kept accidentally stepping on their cassocks. 




Looking back, I could observe things involving Ivy that to anyone literally possessing a brain would point in one exact direction. It’s not necessarily that I was incapable of putting two and two together, although there was that; it was more that I knew she was annoying but I loved her, and was devoted to her. 

The trouble with the weak is that you have to protect them. The strong don’t need to be protected. The weak take advantage of you—not necessarily even deliberately or consciously but through lack of tact, lack of insight. And after they have taken advantage of you, then you have to protect them. 

But why, Del, why? Because you’re so magnanimous? Because you are strong? Or because you’re a doormat.




“You don’t introduce your girlfriend on a flying trapeze to a hundred of your friends and relatives for no reason,” observed Aunt Beatrice when the family was summoned to London to meet Ivy.  

“That’s true. But most people I know don’t have a girlfriend who is a flying trapeze artist,” I said. “If they did, they would probably do that.”

“Maybe there will be an announcement,” continued Aunt Beatrice. Regarding her son and Ivy. “An engagement.”

There was. The wedding of Albert and Ivy one year later took place at the northernmost tip of Scotland. I took a windswept evening walk along the bracing North Sea with my children, then age eight and twelve. I went for cocktails in the castle. You could pick out the bride’s friends—fellow trapeze artists and contortionists—by their general profile and demeanor: they had names like Jezebel and wore outlandish frocks. 

In the morning I was summoned by the bride to help edit her marriage vows (Sweetheart give me rewrite). By then we were fast friends.

 

 

“So they’re coming in September,” said Aunt Beatrice when their move to the USA was planned a few years later, “and they’ll stay with you until they find a house.”

“Maybe they should rent an apartment until they find a house,” I said. 

But that was not the family ethos. 

So when I got home from teaching my class in Baltimore one day in September, my open-ended houseguests and their baby and their seven steamer trunks were littered across the hall, as they had made the move from London. 

Sobbing was heard. Not the sobbing of an infant. At night there was more sobbing and more tortured one-sided arguments. 

From the moment Ivy landed on our shores she fell completely apart. I was surprised at her behavior because of my rabid Anglophilia and demented conceptions of the British character. Obviously you have sangfroid if you’re going to swing from a flying trapeze over a concrete floor. So where was the proverbial stiff upper lip, the iron nerve of Wellington?

While trying to prepare for my teaching duties every day I would attempt to pretend that Ivy was my grown daughter having a nervous breakdown, so it might seem more normal to imagine her and her baby lurking just outside my office doing laundry, acting needy, and making signs of coming in to chat. 

“I can’t chat right now,” I said gruffly when she crossed the line into my office.

“That’s an interesting outfit you’re wearing,” said Ivy.

“I can’t talk right now,” I said, as I did not have time to explain my outfit.

“It was just a comment,” said Ivy.

I hoped she didn’t find my gruffness offensive. I need not have worried. The person Ivy found offensive was her husband, Albert. 




Ivy was the type of person who liked to wrangle with waiters. 

“Could you bring us something other than soggy bread?”

“This is inedible.” 

“Could I have some non-swamp water please.”




“She sounds like an ass. Why do you like her?” said Amelia. 

“I love her. She’s effervescent. Fizzy. Witty.” 




“Mom, how long are they staying?” said Adelaide.

“Until they find a house.”

“Do they have to stay till then? She’s awful.”

“What? She’s adorable.”

Children and dogs, they have sharp instincts. The girls understood something that I never did. 




Ivy’s violent disaffection with her husband continued to escalate. Her aim became divorce. But Albert wouldn’t let her go, and Ivy wasn’t satisfied with the financial settlements he came up with from time to time in half-hearted gestures of surrender. 

 Every Monday evening she and I took long walks through the greensward. I loved hearing her complain incessantly about “your bloody country.” I loved hearing her complain incessantly about Albert. He had to brush his skin and meditate and hang upside down on a transverse lumbar contraption in the morning before he could help their daughter or talk to Ivy about her needs. Albert was limited, I told her. Most people are. 

I tried to empathize; I pondered Ivy’s “noble struggle” to get free. 

BECAUSE I AM THE WORLD’S LITERALLY MOST STUPID PERSON

Albert may have had to brush his skin and hang upside down to find the strength to cope, but he, like me, was an innocent. At times I found the situation annoying for its endless lack of resolution, but I went on to chastise myself for ignobility. I could always find ignoble motives in myself. I searched in vain to find them in others. 

I must be magnanimous and help Ivy in her struggle. 

CLUELESSNESS TRAINING AVAILABLE HERE

The moralist asks herself what the good person would do, and has to force herself, sometimes, to act in that way. And she will always search herself for blame before she blames another.

THE CREDO OF THE SAPSUCKER

“Shall we go look at the cherry blossoms?” said Ivy one day in the spring. “We can take Aunt Beatrice and Stella when they visit.”

“I really don’t see what the big deal is about the cherry blossoms,” I commented. 

Cherry blossoms and giant pandas—people are always raving about how enchanting they are. 

“Aside from your enmity to the cherry blossoms, it would be a nice family activity.” 

I let it drop. I would let the suggestion marinate. Maybe they would go without me.  

Why were we always wrangling? I assumed it was just Ivy’s domineering personality. 

In reality, as I now look back, I see it was me standing in her way. 

It would be annoying enough, her constant woes, my stalwart friendship, even without the knowledge I later learned of her ungodly actions going on in secret. But in light of what she was really doing at the time—it is beyond what can be understood.

At least it was beyond what could be understood by me. 

“How’s Jack?” asked Ivy before we parted that day. 

“Well … when you’ve been married twenty-five years, it’s kind of like a Walker Percy novel,” I said vaguely. 

“How’s the tennis?” Ivy asked. It was our code word for sex. 

“Right, it’s been a long time, the longest it has ever been, I need to work on that …”

Thus the dupe, whose nature is so far from doing harm that she suspects none.




Ivy was ten years younger than me and people kept mistaking me for her mother at their wedding. But my confidence in what I saw as my intrinsic glamour had always been strangely secure. Despite my librarian-like presentation. A plain Jane—why, Miss Jones, you’re beautiful! 

Former glamour girl and now Deposed matriarch. 




“How was it possible?” I inappropriately asked my seventeen-year-old daughter, who was doubtless already irreversibly traumatized by her discovery of the texts but more insightful than marriage counselors or shrinks.

“He’s about to lose his last child to adulthood, both daughters out of the house, he’s scared or doesn’t know how to proceed …” 

“Have you been diagnosed as a certified genius?” I asked her. 

“I watch a lot of movies.”  




“Why are you so calm and gracious, Del?” asked Louise Brown. “I’d go straight to her door and say, ‘If you come near any member of my family, I will destroy you.’ ” 

This was bemusing advice from an iron magnolia in New Orleans. One bemusing part was the contrast between Louise’s butter-wouldn’t-melt-in-her-mouth demeanor and her iron wrath. It was not my way. But it was food for thought. 

The iron magnolias in New Orleans urgently advised me to make such declarations as the above in no uncertain terms. They were incensed with rage at the suggestion of a particle of sympathy for Ivy, which I still had from time to time. Maybe because my backbone had been surgically removed. 

“She keeps texting me,” said Jack’s sister Stella, who was visiting him when I went to New Orleans. “I don’t know whether to let her visit me. Here at your house.” 

A temporary backbone had been surgically reinserted in my spine so I delivered a more unequivocal answer. 

“It’s not a good idea,” I said. “That’s all I know.” 

It felt forceful. 

But you can’t control how people feel. You can only try to work with it. What did I do, possibly, to make someone behave this way toward me; what is humanity, etc. 

The temporary backbone was corroding. 




Take a world-class city, and it will always have sleaze. A Bourbon Street–type situation, as in New Orleans. Washington, D.C., doesn’t have that kind of sleaze—although of course it has other kinds. Sleazy politicians, the barnacles you can’t scrape off the boat.

It was Grace’s last year at home so I returned to the capital. Passing her room I stopped to watch her apply makeup with the surgical precision of a highly trained bomb defuser, and felt momentarily renewed. 

“Mom you can’t talk about this with your daughters, you have to stop, we are going out into the world, we want to do it with some shred of optimism,” said Grace.

Ouch.

Fair enough. 

“At least I’m not lying in bed all day with a bottle of vodka. Wouldn’t most people be doing that?”

“Do you have a therapist, Mom?”

“I had one but she was illiterate and tedious and annoying so I had to get out of it.”




Like George Washington, I could not tell a lie. But unlike George Washington, my hair was a disaster and my soul was filled with darkness. It was January. I was conducting my twenty minutes per day of interrogation and analysis allowed by the generic books on infidelity I consulted.

“You look like Lord Kitchener finding the First Lord of the Admiralty’s report unsatisfactory,” said Jack.

Yeah. Duh.

He was reading a twelve-volume biography of Winston Churchill. Lord Kitchener was as disappointed with the conduct of the troops as I was. Or maybe it was just my vibe. My fun-buster persona. And what about his vibe. I would have to teach him. I kept giving him the generic books and articles. I was trying to teach him about—what, the Ten Commandments? Basic concepts of ethics? Who am I, Virgil leading Dante from the Inferno toward Paradise? Yes.

Later he was studiously rereading one of the generic books that I had lent him. This book was unintentionally hilarious while being biblically instructive. It was addressed to the betraying man who wanted to get his wife back. It was written from the perspective that your wife is an incomprehensible creature it would be impossible to communicate with unless you learn a set of alien specifications and precise instructions regarding how to pacify her, how to answer her questions, and if this was all too difficult to grasp, scripted speeches were included at the end, with cautions not to sound as if you’d memorized them. But from this ludicrous framework came a message of resolve and exactitude. The only way forward.




“Are you ready to put this behind you and move on, Del?” asked the marriage counselor.

“No I’m not ready. Are you joking? And give up all this—the cross-examinations, the tortured speculations, the pleas for repentance, the search for clues, the prosecution of the case, the—”

The in-laws would be coming for Passover and I would be drowning in a sea of pathology. I would have to hold it together. I would be like the Duke of Wellington on the battlefield watching his general lose his leg and still cheering on the troops. 

Later I was driving home and there had been a storm. The atmosphere was ominous and violent. The car radio was playing a familiar and dramatic piece of classical music that was also ominous and violent. I struggled to identify it—Brahms? Mahler? Finally on the streets of Chevy Chase in the storm-washed winter greensward I realized it was the score from Swan Lake. 

I had taken Ivy to that ballet while, unbeknownst to me, the infamy was going on. I had been so easy to deceive. It galvanized anew in me the need to try to ascertain: Where was I? Where the hell was I.




The most able in a family helps the others. That was pretty much Jack’s role in his. He paid their bills if necessary, he restructured their debt, he funded accounts for their children’s college education. A dazzling consideration for others blazed through his being—that was what I’d always seen in Jack before.

If he seems missing from this story it is because I no longer knew who he was. It takes a long time before you can blame him, not her. And ever since the exact moment of his disclosure, he had lost his personality. He acted wooden. As a consequence of his sad tortured lost-soul demeanor I often felt compelled to minister to him—instead of the reverse. As if I had to be the strong one or was not the injured party.

I asked what was bothering him now. He claimed that what was bothering him was Adelaide wanting to quit her job at the anarchist bookstore in order to devote herself to fighting racism. If you’re upset about her devoting her life to fighting racism, I mused, then maybe it means you are a racist.

“I feel guilt and sadness at how I ruined everything,” he said. He was gloomy, deadened and wooden. He seemed subsumed by nostalgia. “I don’t want to lose you, because I love you and you are my vision of truth,” he said in his tortured wooden way. “You face the truth head-on. The consequences may be awful but you would rather confront them than avoid them. I have met few who have this courage. And honesty.” 

“Really? Where have you been living, Alcatraz?” 

“I want things to be like they were before, Del,” said Jack. “I want to go back to that.” 

“It can never be what it was before. That’s over. It has to be something different. For me it will be better. My life won’t be a quixotic delusion.”




I straggled into the marriage counselor’s like a sad old person. I felt like a slug. I felt old. “How are you, Del?” 

“I feel old.” 

“How about you, Jack?” 

“I feel deadened.” 

“You’re cured!” said the marriage counselor inexplicably. 

She turned to me. “You’ve made so much progress.” 

“I have?” 

“You’ve both done so much work. You’re stable now.” 

“We are?” It was so weird. “And by the way, why did Ivy never ask for my forgiveness?” 

“Because she’s not sorry,” said the marriage counselor. 

Having your brain surgically removed meant that you would never think of that yourself. That our friendship could have meant so little to her and been so easy to sacrifice. That the stakes were higher if she won with Jack than if she lost with me.  

And what’s the deal with the weird fake frozen smile? The one she has when she sees me. When I run into her in the neighborhood, as I prayed I never would but as I occasionally did. It makes her look like a different person from the one I knew. More cunning than any creature in the field.




The towering mid-Atlantic spring had come and gone, and the swamp-laden allergy-ridden summer was in full force. 

“You need to get your things for college, Grace,” I said. I felt a pang of psychic weakness to anticipate our parting.

“Mainly I have to go to Bed Bath and Beyond to get stuff for my dorm room.” 

“What’s the Beyond for, I wonder. Do they have shower curtains on the Andromeda Strain? Why can’t it just be Housewares.” 

“It’s for bed, bath, and kitchen.”

“But instead it has to be a huge euphemism. Like you can’t say ‘kitchen.’ It’s too blunt. You have to use this huge euphemism—Beyond—like beyond the galaxy.” 

“I think it just means a realm of mediocre knickknacks and random pots and pans,” said Grace. “Calm down.” 

Then she went off to conduct her wastrel youth and climb the steep hill that would lead to all the years ahead, armed with the salutary loss of innocence that had escaped her loving, unusual mother. 




My father had a recurring dream: he was in Italy, at a crossroads; in one direction was a village with a hill, in the other direction—nothing. 

One road led to interest/aspiration and the other to nothing/nowhere. It was pretty obvious which road you would take, right? The idea, to me, was that you had this choice—

“This is a test of your character.”

    "text": "There’s no end to the woes that mothers face come summer vacation. All the children are at home. When they’re not in front of the TV, they’re either climbing the guava tree in the front yard or perched on the compound wall. What if one of them falls and breaks an arm or a leg? Then there’s the crying, the laughter, the punishments they inflict on one another based on some arcane system of justice … This was why Razia’s headaches worsened when the summer holidays started. The nerves in her temples throbbed, her hot head felt like it would burst, and it seemed as if the veins at the back of her neck might snap at any moment. One after the other the children rushed in with their complaints, crying and screaming … and then there were their games … abbabbaa … battles with swords and machine guns, bomb attacks … ! 

Enough is enough, she thought, and lay on the divan cot in the hall with a piece of cloth wound tightly around her head. She couldn’t bear the noise. The TV was on, though at a low volume. She had warned the children sternly, and was just beginning to hope that she could finally relax and put her feet up when one of them wailed, “Doddammaaa … Doddamma, she’s pinching me!” Fuming, Razia jumped to her feet, silently cursing them.

Her husband, Latif Ahmad, entered the room just as she was thinking, Six brats are already here. Each brother-in-law has two-two … three-three … and all of them have landed up for the holidays. And my two younger sisters’ children are here too—for God’s sake, what am I supposed to do! Seeing the state his wife was in, he grew alert. She had always been allergic to children. There were the terrible headaches, to begin with, and the noisy children only rubbed masala on the wound … Glancing helplessly at them out of the corner of his eye, he mentally counted … one, two, three, four … eighteen in all, all between three and twelve.

Before Razia could say a word, Latif Ahmad scolded them: “Ey, sit down quietly, all of you—anyone who makes noise will get nothing!” Hussain appeared with a basket of mangoes from the farm. As the children shrieked and swooped on the basket, it was Latif Ahmad’s turn to take fright. He gave his wife a forlorn look and walked to the bathroom. Unable to stand her headache, Razia grabbed one or two of the children within reach and whacked them, patapatapata … The prospect of unending torture all summer made her decide that bed rest had to be engineered for at least some of them. Circumcision, she concluded. She would get khatna done.

According to her calculations, eight of the eighteen children were girls, so they would be spared. The ages of four of the remaining ten were even numbers—four, six, eight—so those little devils would be spared, too. Without a word of protest, Latif Ahmad agreed to khatna for the remaining six.

Theirs was one of the wealthy families in the district center. Although all four of Latif Ahmad’s younger brothers had government jobs and lived elsewhere, the family ceremonies were conducted in their eldest brother’s house. Razia skimped on no expense, considering it her duty to host them well. Besides, she was happy that two of the six boys to be circumcised were her younger sisters’ sons.

Under her supervision, preparations began. Several meters of red alwan were bought. The children joined their Doddamma in making the arrangements. Razia cut the cloth to measure for lungis. The girls had a great deal of work to do, painting the lungis and stitching sequins and zari onto them. After making the lungis for the six boys, quite a bit of cloth remained, leaving Razia wondering what to do with the rest of the roll. An idea flashed in her mind. “Arrey, what about the cook Amina’s son, Arif? And there’s our farmworker’s son, Farid, too … In fact, why don’t we get khatna done for some other children from poor families as well?” She got to work right away. 

There were five masidis in town, including the Jamia Masidi and the Masjid-e-Noor. The secretaries of all five mosques made announcements after the Friday namaz: “As an offering to God, Latif Ahmad Saheb has made arrangements for a mass Sunnat-e-Ibrahim next Friday after the afternoon namaz. Those who want their children to participate must register in advance.”

They could have just used the word khatna, but a public announcement on a stage with a microphone had to be formal. The implication was that this was a celebration for Prophet Ibrahim. It amounted to the same thing, though: a collective ceremony at which the children looked forward to the festivities and ended up screaming.




Everything went according to plan. Several poor families registered their boys. Razia made one lungi after another. The children in her family got lungis with sequins and zari, while the others would get plain ones. There were so many sequins on her son Samad’s lungi that it was impossible to tell the color of the fabric. Sackfuls of wheat and copra were gathered, and almonds, raisins, dates, and ghee made from cow’s milk were bought. The children were strangely restless and fidgety, but there was a festive air, and everyone else was happy. Before anyone knew it, Friday arrived. Once the afternoon namaz had ended, Latif Ahmad quickly had lunch and went to the compound next to one of the masidis. Many people were gathered; the children getting khatna and their parents had formed a line. An army of young men was in attendance as volunteers, all of them dressed in white shalwar and jubbas, and wearing either white topis or white cloths wound around their heads. They looked fresh and clean, having bathed just before the Friday namaz. Some had lined their eyes with surma and dabbed themselves liberally with perfume. There was a pleasant fragrance in the air. 

Khatna was to be carried out inside the nearby madrasa. Ibrahim, who was built like a wrestler, was the most important person of the day. His biceps bulged beneath his white mul jubba. While doing khatna was his family profession, he was a barber the rest of the time. He was busy making his preparations in a corner of the large hall. He began by placing a bronze bindige, borrowed for the ceremony, upside down. Razia had made Amina scrub it with tamarind juice two-two times to make it shine. A plate heaped with finely sieved ash lay in front of the upended pot.

Ibrahim inspected the arrangements until he was satisfied. He was extremely experienced in this matter. It was said that when he brought the knife down, the khatna was completed perfectly and would heal without infection. Such was his fame. In another corner of the hall, a group of young men had laid down a large jammkhana, taking care to smooth out the mat’s wrinkles. Ibrahim checked everything once again, and then slowly rose to his feet. He took a shaving razor from his pocket, whisked it across his left palm, and ordered, “Start bringing them in one at a time.”

Abbas, one of the volunteers standing next to him with an uneasy expression, couldn’t keep himself from saying, “If you just give me the razor, I can sterilize it in hot water. We can add a little Dettol to disinfect it, too, I think.” Ibrahim glanced at Abbas—here was someone, he realized, who had walked the steps of a college. He looked at Abbas with a disdain reserved for vermin and mockingly asked why. “So that there’s no chance of septic …” Disconcerted, Abbas trailed off. But Ibrahim was not done, and maliciously asked whether he had had such an infection, which made Abbas’s friends giggle, ki ki ki … Annoyed, Abbas snapped at them—“So uncivilized, the lot of you”—and walked off. Ibrahim smiled triumphantly and called out once again, “Come on in, one at a time.”

The volunteers outside ordered the boys to remove their underwear. At the head of the line was Arif, who, at thirteen, was almost grown up. While boys were usually circumcised before they turned nine, his mother, Amina, hadn’t had the money. Onlookers tittered as Arif, after removing his shalwar, tugged at his shirt. A young man struggling to contain his laughter clapped the boy lightly on the back and pushed him inside. 

Five or six people sat Arif down on the bronze bindige. He was thoroughly confused, and before he could tell what was happening, a pair of strong arms appeared and reached under his armpits. Hands clamped down on his thighs and parted his legs. As he screamed in terror, two other men pinned his arms behind his back. Arif’s heart was racing, and he wanted to escape. But the people holding him down were smarter and stronger. They gave him no room even to wriggle. Arif tried with all his might to free himself, and screamed himself hoarse: “Let go, let me go, aiyo … Amma … Allah!” As though expecting this very response, three or four men chimed in to chide him: “Ey, you shouldn’t scream like that, say ‘deen, deen.’ ” Between gasps Arif repeated, “Deen … deen … Allah … Allah … Amma … aiyooo …”

As this drama was unfolding, Ibrahim calmly attached a strip of bamboo sliced thin as paper to Arif’s penis, choosing a spot that left only the foreskin hanging in front of it. One of the men turned Arif’s face away and urged, “Bol re, say it, boy, say ‘deen,’ say it quickly, quickly!” The word deen can mean anything from “faith” to “dharma,” but even without knowing any of its meanings, Arif screamed his lungs out, “Deen! Deen!” His tongue dried up, sweat dripped down his back, and a wave of heat rose through his body while his arms and legs went cold with fear. One last time, he made a futile effort to free himself. 

“Why, boy?” asked one of the volunteers, pinning his legs down. “Let me go, let me go, I have to piss,” he begged, only to be told “In a minute.” They held him down tighter. Ibrahim brought out the razor he’d been hiding behind his back and slid it in one swift movement across the tip of Arif’s penis. The foreskin fell onto the plate of ash. Blood spurted from the wound. Ibrahim gently sprinkled some of the ash on the cut, which stanched the flow of blood. Arif’s face was pale, and he was soaked in sweat. His sobs continued sporadically. Two young men lifted him unceremoniously and laid him down on the floor in a corner of the hall. The cool plaster provided his buttocks some relief, but still there was a burning pain …  

Some of the young men got hold of another boy and dragged him to Ibrahim. Abbas gave Arif some water and began to fan him. A voice wailed, “Deen … deen …” Arif clutched his stomach and writhed in pain as the boy was laid on a mat next to him.

“Deen … deen …” The screams continued in various voices. Bodies everywhere thrashed in agony. Despite the searing pain, Arif’s eyes began to close. Drowsiness overtook him—and then, just as suddenly, he was awake again. After drifting in and out of sleep a couple of times, he was about to slip into a deep slumber when someone shook him gently. Although he was still in pain, it was no longer unbearable, and he slowly opened his eyes. Abbas was standing before him with sympathy. “Arif, can you walk?” he asked. “Look, your mother’s here.”

His mother, dressed in a threadbare burqa, could neither appear before the eyes of the men nor leave her son alone in this condition. She peeped in from the other side of the door. The sight of his mother’s faded burqa gave Arif a burst of strength. With Abbas’s help, he rose to his feet and slowly hobbled out.

Latif Ahmad, seated on a stool at the door, handed him a bag. Arif discovered that it held some wheat, two halves of copra, a packet of sugar, some butter wrapped in plastic … His mouth watered. 

A boy on the brink of entering stumbled at the threshold. When the boy began to cry, Arif drew himself up to his full height like a superhero, and called after him, “Ey … Subhan, don’t be scared … ‘Deen’—just say ‘deen’ … you’ll be fine.” He had become a veteran. 

Amina took the bag from Arif and told him to him sit on the veranda outside. He lowered himself gingerly and spread his legs to ensure that his lungi did not touch the wound. A boy standing in line asked loudly, “Lo, Arif … does it hurt?” Taking care not to show any sign of pain, Arif replied, “No, not at all, kano. Doesn’t hurt a bit.”

A bearded middle-aged man standing nearby heard him and said, “Shabhash, son. Here, take this, use it to look after yourself,” and gave him a fifty-rupee note. All the boys waiting looked at Arif with envy. Screams could be heard inside. “Deen … deen … aiyooo … Allah …” Another boy was pushed inside.

The boys went in one by one, each emerging a while later in a red lungi. It was in the midst of all this that the woman appeared. Gaunt, with deep-set eyes, she didn’t seem to possess hips, and yet she was carrying a baby on one. A patched-up blouse hid behind her tattered sari. The woman was dragging a six- or seven-year-old boy behind her. The boy kept squirming, but her grip was strong. His cries were heart-wrenching. The woman tried to draw the end of her ripped sari over her head, but, in the process, it only unraveled further. In a voice barely audible even to herself, she said, “Bhaiyya …” Engrossed in conversation, Latif Ahmad took a moment to turn around and ask, “What is it, ma?”

The boy started crying louder. “I want him to get Sunnat too, bhaiyya,” the woman pleaded. “No, no, I don’t want it!” the boy shouted, trying to run away. His mother held his arm firmly. In the tussle, the cowl she had made with the end of her sari slipped from her head. Her shriveled belly, protruding collarbone, sunken eyes, and ragged blouse were most disturbing to Latif. 

Averting his gaze, he looked down at the ground and scolded the boy: “Ey, stand quietly. Don’t you want to be part of the deen? You cannot belong to Islam without khatna. Is that what you want?” Between sobs, the boy spilled the truth: “I’ve had my khatna already.”

His mother, agitated, immediately said, “But it wasn’t done properly, bhaiyya … It can be done properly this time.” Latif Ahmad was suspicious, but he couldn’t be sure. Summoning one of the young men standing nearby, he said, “Ey, Sami, grab this kid and examine him.” A few mischievous boys hanging around in the hope of some entertainment lifted the child up in the air, and one of them pulled his shorts down. The ill-fitting garment, made to someone else’s measurements, was easily slipped off. The crowd was on the verge of laughter as they watched the scene. “The khatna has been done properly.” The boys let out the guffaws they had been holding back. One of the men said unkindly, “Bring your husband, too. Let’s get him circumcised so you get your wheat and copra.” There was another roar of laughter. 

As soon as the boy was released, he hurriedly pulled his shorts back up and fled. His mother covered her head once more with the frayed seragu of her sari and left, dragging her feet. “Thoo! So many lowlifes in this world … They’ll stoop to any level,” said one of the men, spitting in disgust. 

Latif Ahmad began to feel somehow uneasy. Had he been inhumane in the face of such poverty and misery? The image of the woman kept returning to him. “Che, I shouldn’t have sent her away empty-handed.” With some remorse, he looked around for her, but she had vanished as suddenly as she had appeared.




The line kept moving along. Red lungis kept emerging. Latif Ahmad impatiently looked at the clock. It was five o’clock already. Dr. Prakash, a well-known local surgeon, had asked him to bring his family’s children for circumcision by six. What were they up to now? Razia had bathed all of them that morning, lavishing a little extra love on her eldest son, Samad. For six years now, ever since he had turned five, she had been telling her husband, “Let’s get the child circumcised—look how thin he’s become!” Razia expected him to put on some weight after his khatna. But Latif Ahmad hadn’t had the courage to schedule the procedure, and kept postponing with one excuse or another. Finally the time had come, and he was still anxious.

Razia’s brothers-in-law had come for the ceremony. Her sisters had also traveled a long distance. The house was full of guests, all the children dressed in new clothes and the boys getting khatna strutting about. While the men, young and old, were at the masidi for the mass khatna, the local girls and older women had gathered at Latif Ahmad’s house.

After lunch, the family made the boys, dressed in their sherwanis, Nehru jackets, and zari topis, sit down in a row. Garlands long enough to reach their feet went around their necks. They wore jasmine flowers around their wrists. Well-wishers came. They cuddled the children. Some slipped gold rings onto their fingers, and others gave presents of gold chains. The five-hundred- and one-hundred-rupee notes they received were too numerous to count. Everyone who came performed the ritual of warding off the evil eye, cracking their knuckles above the children’s heads. Betel leaves, bananas, karji kaayi, and other snacks were distributed. No one had time for conversation. The house was bursting with confusion and chaos as everyone hurried about …

The woman materialized in front of Latif Ahmad: he had just gotten someone to bring him a chair and, sitting on it to rest his tired legs, was opening his mouth to yawn—“Aaa …”—and there she was. She was thin, and an old sweater covered her breasts, which were wet. She had an faded scarf tied around her head. Her face was pale. She was holding something—a cloth bundle pressed close to her chest.

“Bhaiyya! Sunnat for this one too, please …” Latif Ahmad stared at the tender bud, maybe a month old at most, wrapped in the cloth, and then looked up at the mother. He grew apprehensive—what if the young men nearby gathered around and said nasty things? Without another word, he took a hundred-rupee note from his pocket and put it in her hands. He had begun to feel as though it were Razia standing in front of him, with Samad in her arms. The woman walked off without a backward glance. Latif Ahmad wished he had given a little money to the woman who had come earlier, too. Then again, another woman would lead to yet another … and another … and surely one more … They would keep coming, and where would the end be to it all? It was only after the last boy was circumcised and everyone had been sent home that Latif Ahmad took a moment to compose himself. Now he had to take care of his family’s children.  

Everyone was ready to go to the surgeon by six o’clock, when Latif Ahmad reached home. Dr. Prakash had told him, “We’ll give the children a local anesthetic so they won’t feel a thing. After a good night’s sleep, they’ll wake up feeling fresh.” The whole family gathered outside the operating room in Dr. Prakash’s clinic. The surgeries were conducted smoothly, even though a few of the boys fussed and cried. 

Back home, they were put to bed on soft mattresses under whirring fans. A number of people stood by to wait on them hand and foot. Only one or two of the children groaned in pain now and again, and outside their room, there was no letup in the laughter, loud chatter, and festivities. The boys were woken every eight hours, given almond paste mixed with milk and painkillers, and put down again. Most of them had recovered by the next day. There was an abundance of good food to help them heal faster—milk, ghee, almonds, dates … enough for everyone—enough, even, to throw away.




On the fifth day after the khatna, there was a commotion in the front yard. Razia went downstairs and, peeping outside, saw Arif in the guava tree, plucking the half-ripened green fruits. Two of the servants were shouting at him to get down. His mother, Amina, stood under the tree, alternately begging the servants and beseeching her son. After he’d had his fill of the fruits, Arif took his time climbing down, and then the servants grabbed him. When they brought him to Razia, he casually took another guava from his pocket and bit into it. Razia told the servants to let go of him and asked in surprise, “Has your wound healed?”

“Hmm, yes, Chikkamma,” he replied, parting his lungi without any shame or hesitation. Razia couldn’t believe her eyes. There wasn’t even a bandage. The cut had healed. There was no pus, either. Meanwhile, her son Samad couldn’t stretch his legs. The wound had become infected, despite all the antibiotics. That morning, Samad hadn’t been able to walk to the bathroom for his bath. They’d had to carry him and set him down on a stool. His wound had been covered with a sterilized steel cup so that it wouldn’t get wet. Afterward, he’d been exhausted. They’d had to dry him gently. A nurse sent by Dr. Prakash bandaged the wound again and gave him an injection. And here was Arif, playing like a monkey in a tree. “What medicine have you been taking, Arif—what kind of pills?” Razia couldn’t stop herself from asking. “I haven’t taken any medicine, Chikkamma. They put some ash on the wound, that was all …”

Razia hadn’t really understood how khatna was carried out on the children of the poor. She was deeply troubled to learn that ash was sprinkled on their wounds. She went back inside, fretting about what might happen if one of these helpless children were to die. After checking on all the other children sleeping upstairs, she went to her son. Samad was asleep, too. Several types of sweets, biscuits, and fresh and dry fruits were piled high on the teapoy next to him. She looked out the window to check whether Arif was still in the front yard, meaning to call him upstairs and give him at least a packet of biscuits. But he was nowhere to be seen. She laid a light blanket over her son and went downstairs to the kitchen to supervise the cooking.

There was chicken soup to be made for the circumcised boys, and pulao and kurma for the guests, but she hadn’t been ten minutes in the kitchen with Amina before she began to feel uneasy again. Even though Razia was sure that the food wouldn’t be ready in time without her supervision, she had an urge to leave. Abandoning the chicken she’d been checking on, she rushed upstairs. 

Razia had shut the door of Samad’s bedroom so that he could sleep undisturbed. She pushed it open and let out a hair-raising scream. A black veil fell over her eyes. The rest of the family rushed out of their rooms to find Razia unconscious and a blood-soaked Samad lying on the floor. He had woken up and gotten out of bed to look for his mother, but had fainted before he could reach the door. He had banged his head on the wall, and blood was pouring out. The wound from the operation had also opened, and blood dripped from that as well. And so Samad was taken to the hospital.

On the eleventh day after the khatna, the children of Latif Ahmad’s family were given a ritual bath. This was also the day Samad returned from the hospital. There was a grand celebration at home that evening. The entire town had been invited. Several goats were slaughtered, and preparations had been made for the feast. Shamianas had been set up in front of the house and on the terrace. The aroma of biryani wafted in waves from the backyard. Samad was still very weak, and Razia wouldn’t let him out of her sight. She cradled his head on her lap and met visitors without getting up from the divan cot. 

Later, Razia noticed someone slinking across the drawing room. “Ey … who’s that? Come here,” she said. The figure returned. “It’s me, Chikkamma …” Razia’s eyes widened. It was Arif! Even in his worn-out shirt with its torn collar, he radiated health. He had discarded the red lungi and had started wearing trousers. That meant his wound had healed completely. She turned toward Samad, her eyes filling with tears, and muttered to herself, “Khar ku Khuda ka yaar, gareeb ku parvardigaar”—If there are people to help the rich, the poor have God’s help.

Razia’s gaze drifted to Arif’s trousers, threadbare at the knees. Seeing her silent and lost in thought, he turned, revealing two more big holes, one in his pants and the other in his shirt. 

“Wait, Arif,” Razia said, getting to her feet. She opened the cupboard and ran her eyes over a stack of neatly folded clothes. About a dozen outfits, given to Samad as presents, were still in their packaging. She picked out a pair of trousers and a T-shirt too large for Samad and gave them to Arif, saying, “Take these. Put them on. Make sure you’re wearing them when you come over to eat, all right?”

Arif’s eyes began to twinkle when he took in the clothes. The look he gave Razia reflected more devotion than gratitude. He tentatively stroked the T-shirt, and she smiled. Samad sat up, laying his head on her shoulder. Arif kept looking back at them as he slowly walked toward the door, hugging the clothes that Razia had given him to his chest."

    "text": "On the fourth day, my housemate’s ex left radishes and kale on our stoop. They shouted up at our second-floor porch until my housemate came out. They told her she could have the garden plot they’d sown together. It’s too far from my place, they yelled. I can’t keep it up.

Okay, she yelled. I’ll think about it, she yelled.

After they left, we walked to the community garden. She showed me the chives and the calendula and the bolted kale. This all seemed to be tremendous good luck. The grocery stores were newly to be avoided. This was the time, if ever there was a time, to have a vegetable garden.

They never had the stomach for salting slugs, she said as she plucked one from a strawberry plant.

They had been lovers. We were not lovers, she and I. We were not friends. We were housemates, that category of person both more intimate and more distant than friend. Back at the house, she gave me the radishes and kale.

I can’t eat them, she said. I can’t even look at them. 

I can understand that, I said. I ate them.




On the seventh day, they approached her in the parking lot of the Safeway. She had bags, more bags than she could carry, her two-week provisions. She had set the bags down to reposition them when a voice behind her said, Can I help you with that?

Could it have been a coincidence? she asked me when she arrived home. Them being at the same Safeway at the same time?

Could be, I said. 

I remember this moment—my housemate at the front door, the sanitizer she’d attempted to make from vodka and xanthan gum glopping off her hands—because right then the best friend texted me. This was a surprise. For six months we had not talked. She had needed space. I had been giving her space.

Hey, how are you doing? her text said. I read it again: Hey. How are you doing? I read it again: Hey. How. Are. You. Doing?

The words inflated in me a helium balloon, which made it impossible to attend to whatever my housemate said next, impossible to eat the potato I’d just baked, impossible to do anything but float around the house on tiptoe for hours, thinking about how I would respond.

I’m okay. How are you? I sent the two statements in separate texts just for the joy of sending them.




At two in the morning on the ninth day, my housemate heard three knocks at her window. Her cat heard them, too. The hair down his spine stood up. She called, Who’s there? 

No one answered. 

She crept to the kitchen, where she took a knife from the knife block. She crept back to her room. She thrust on the ceiling light. Through her window, the light illuminated the second-floor porch. On the porch, we kept a futon. That night, due to the shadows, it looked like someone was sitting on the futon. She yelled and threw open the window, but no one was there. She put the knife down on her dresser and got back into bed, where she watched Disney+ until dawn. She told me all this in the morning. I hadn’t woken up. I hadn’t heard a thing.

I was so scared, she said.

A knife? I said.

I was so scared, she said. She hugged herself.

What if it had been me on the porch?

Was it you?

Of course not.

Well, someone was there.




On the eleventh day, I found a leafy plant with red berries on our front stoop. In the pot, a folded note—Goldenseal helps heal, it said.

I called my housemate down to look at the goldenseal. That’s their handwriting, she said. The handwriting wasn’t anything special. Messy, a scrawl.

We showed the goldenseal to the woman who lived next door. She stood in the doorway of her house. We yelled from six feet away, Did you see this plant?

The what? she yelled.

The plant, we yelled.

Oh, that, she yelled. That’s been there a couple days.

I knew it, my housemate said. I knew they were there that night.

I don’t like the idea of them hanging around here at night.

You don’t like it, she said, a high-pitched edge to her voice. You don’t like it.




On the fourteenth day, they sat in their car one block down the street, facing our house, for four hours. She didn’t recognize the car, but she recognized their profile—the square jaw she’d massaged with a jade roller every night when they were together.

This isn’t okay, I said, watching them from the window. I don’t want us to pretend this is okay.

She wasn’t pretending. She knew what to do. She recorded the date in her Notes app. When they left, she recorded the time in her Notes app. She paced around the house, and I moved out of her way. The whole day she kept her phone in her hand, so she could be ready to record anything at a moment’s notice.

I envied her ease with her phone. I was avoiding mine. The best friend had not responded to my text. I had texted her again—Want to catch up? She had not responded. I’d sealed my phone in a waterproof bag and buried it while repotting a dahlia in our kitchen.




On the seventeenth day, they came to the front door. I was on the stoop. My housemate was sunning herself in the backyard.

They said, Is C. home?

I said, She’s in the backyard.

They went to the backyard. My housemate went still, she later told me, when she saw them. They sat six feet away from her in the grass and said they wanted to do the garden together.

That wasn’t the deal, she said.

Why not? they said. Then they asked other questions—Could we try again to be together? Do you still care about me?

She sat with them for thirty-five minutes, then offered to get them lemonade. They accepted this offer, so she walked evenly to the front door. She said to me, Come inside. A command.

I followed her. She slammed the door behind us, all her weight against it. She threw the deadbolt and ran up the stairs, heaving at the top, saying, You told them where I was. Why the hell did you tell them where I was?

I didn’t know it was a secret, I said.

You can’t tell them where I am, she said.

Three years before, when she’d tried to leave them, they’d followed, tailing her so close that the bumper of their car nudged the back wheel of her bike. Now do you understand? she said.

This isn’t okay, I said. We should do something, call the police.

They’re gone, she said. She checked from the windows. She checked from the porch. The police aren’t going to do anything.

I went to the dahlia and dug my phone out of the pot. 

Why is your phone in the dahlia? she said. I don’t want you to call the police. She had put a sign on our front door—DEFUND THE POLICE, INVEST IN COMMUNITY.

Why didn’t you tell me they were dangerous? I said.

They’re not dangerous, she said. Not to you.

Perhaps I would, still, have called the police, but when I turned on my phone, the best friend had texted me back. She had responded that she felt a short conversation was in keeping with our intention for contact.

I texted the best friend, Tomorrow?

She texted, Tomorrow is too soon.

The best friend and I had once been inseparable. We’d worked together at the dingy county health center. When she suggested I try out they pronouns, I did. When I suggested she return to grad school, she did. Everyone said we were good for each other. Then she met her boyfriend. I never expected him to last, but he did last. I trailed the pair of them like a street dog when they allowed it, moped when they refused. She moved with him to the Southwest. I tried to kill myself. I told her. In the long nights that followed that attempt, when I lay awake afraid of what I’d almost done, I texted her—I can’t take this anymore. I just want to skip out on the next five years. 

She texted things like, Just try to sleep, and, The day is wiser than the dark, which was a saying she knew in Russian, and, Are you safe? Should I call someone? 

I had to sit down on my bed when she texted that, her texts little shots of adrenaline that left me lightheaded, dizzy with her care.

When she didn’t respond for a night, I texted, Hello? I texted, Are you there? I texted, Please talk to me. I texted just her name, over and over and over until she sent, Are you okay?

After months of this, she said she thought we should take a break.

I said, What do you mean a break?

She said, A few months off, then we check in.

I muted my phone and kicked the front door of our house, three strong kicks, then unmuted my phone and said, Okay.

But now the break was over. Now we would have a phone call.




On the twentieth day, my housemate and I were on the second-floor porch. I was working, which meant writing a monthly newsletter for county health-care providers. In the newsletter, I reminded them to take regular breaks to avoid burnout. I included a link to new evidence in support of ventilator splitting. She was pulling vines out of our hanging planters. 

I have to be able to go out in the world, she said. I can’t stay locked up in this house forever.

She was an aesthetician, but the salons weren’t open. No one knew when they would open again. She could spend only so many days practicing lashes on a rubber head. She said, The people working from home don’t understand. 

I was working from home, responding to occasional replies from the health-care providers. Most were annoyed. They wrote, Who are you? or, I didn’t subscribe to this! They had subscribed, but I always sent an email apologizing, telling them we would immediately delete them from our list.

I acknowledged to my housemate that I didn’t understand. 

What happens next time they come to the house? she said.

I’ll run them off, I said. 

This was optimistic. I had never been in a fight. My housemate had. She’d broken a man’s foot with her stiletto. The best friend had once slapped a man. She’d told me this in a voice low with regret. I’d said he probably deserved it.

You don’t have to worry, I said to my housemate. They come around here again, I’ll take care of it. I wanted to make up for last time. I wanted to prove I could hold my own.

But they didn’t come that day or that evening. They didn’t come the next day. I wished they would come. I wanted to tell the best friend about them, to share with her the story of my victory.




On the twenty-second day, I talked on the phone with the best friend in the graveyard near our house. She was furious, mostly at the government. I cupped the phone to my ear, her fury lovely to behold, refreshing and familiar. I was okay. I had missed her, and I said that, and she didn’t say anything, and I wished I had said something else. She said she needed us to approach friendship slowly, cautiously. I imagined us approaching, together, a boar hit by a car, a boar made more dangerous by its injuries. I imagined I had been hit and stunned by a car and she was approaching me. 

She said her boyfriend was worried about the impact our friendship had on her mental health. He was concerned about abuse in the friendship. 

All I remembered about this boyfriend was that he had once dropped his car keys in a bush and lost them forever. What could he possibly know about me?

I said, Do you think he’s right?

I just feel like I’m walking on eggshells, sometimes, around you. 

She had said this once before. One month after I tried to kill myself, I’d asked to visit her, to spend a week with her in the city where she lived. She’d said she wasn’t ready for that. She was afraid, she said.

Afraid of me? 

Afraid for you.

I responded to her refusal by buzzing my head. I nicked my ear, and in the photo I sent her afterward a little blood was there on the tile, mixed in with all my hair, and she’d texted back immediately, What happened? Are you okay? What did you do? 

It’s hard to hear this, I said.

She said, I know, I mean, it must be.




On the twenty-third day, they brought cat food. They stood on the sidewalk in front of our house, saying, Cat food! I brought you cat food! She went out onto our second-floor porch. They wanted to bring the cat food inside, so she wouldn’t have to carry it up the steps. She told them just to leave it. They wanted to see the house. She told them to leave the cat food. Or take the cat food. But leave. They walked to the front door, which was closed and locked. They walked into the door. They bounced off it, walked into it again, stumbled backward, the cat food like a small body on their shoulder. They walked into the door again.

Stop, she said. Stop.

I stood just behind the door. I wanted to go out onto the porch. I wanted to drive them away, to make the best friend proud of me, but I was newly afraid. I stayed inside.

Eventually, they left the cat food. I went downstairs and dragged the bag through the front door and up the stairs, like a leopard dragging a gazelle’s body into a tree. My housemate was waiting at the top of the stairs.

What happened? she asked. I thought you were going to run them off. 

You had it under control.

I have to seem in control, she said. She showed me her hand, which was shaking. I thought you were going to come out. I was waiting for you.

I’m sorry.

If you tell them to leave, they’ll leave. They listen to masc people.

She blamed testosterone, in part, for their violence. A few months earlier, when she’d interviewed me for the room and I’d told her I was genderqueer, she’d said, Are you thinking about transitioning?

I’d said, Not medically. Not right now.

She’d said, Okay. She’d said, I had a partner who transitioned, and I don’t think I could handle that. I don’t think I could handle having a housemate on T.

Of course, I did think about transitioning. I thought about it regularly, but—and I’d told her this—I was scared of T, too.

Do I remind you of them? I asked her.

My housemate snorted. If you were like them, you’d protect me.




On the twenty-fourth day, I texted the best friend, I can’t stop thinking about our call. An hour later I texted, Do you feel abused by me? The next day she texted, I don’t know. I don’t know how to tell when something is abusive.




On the twenty-sixth day, I texted the best friend to tell her I’d been spending more time with my housemate. She liked the message. She wanted me to have more friends.

I thought about sending her a second text—I don’t feel safe. 

I wrote the text, let it sit in the drafting box on my phone while I worked in the morning. 

The text was true, on its face. I was afraid of the ex, their gaze, the newly apparent porousness of our house, which had a porch door with no deadbolt, a trellis up one side that anyone could scale. 

But the best friend knew about none of this. She would think I was worried about the medicine cabinet, about anything that could be looped and tied. She would read the text and her heart would thud and she would respond immediately, a flurry of texts—hotlines and reminders of safety plans and an offer to call a friend who lived just thirty minutes away and could drive me to the emergency room, if needed, as a precaution. A battalion of texts, her fierce protection enwrapping me. And later, after I reassured her that I was okay, her relief, which felt like love, her wanting me to be alive, wanting me.

I didn’t send the text. It would cause her pain, a text like that, and I didn’t want to cause her pain.




On the twenty-seventh day, I texted other friends, My housemate’s abusive ex is stalking our house.

One texted, Shit. The other texted, Report them.

I guess they’re lonely? I texted. Or just trying to scare us.

One texted, Who knows, people are crazy. The other texted, I don’t think we need to spend time trying to empathize with an abuser.

Disney+ now played in my housemate’s room from sundown to sunup. I started to need it, too, the cartoon voices lulling me to sleep.




On the thirty-second day, the best friend texted me. She’d gotten into a fight with her boyfriend and had said a thing so terrible he’d asked her to leave, and now she was driving somewhere in northern Arizona and was low on radiator fluid and didn’t have enough cell service to search for a mechanic. Could I find her a mechanic? 

I could. I did. I found her four mechanics and texted her addresses for all four in order of nearness to her current location, then in order of price. I sent her a summary of Yelp reviews for each one.

She texted, Okay. Thanks. I’ve got it from here.

But how was she? I texted. If she needed a place to stay, I texted, she could come here.




On the thirty-third day, she texted to thank me. Her car was fixed. She and her boyfriend had worked it out.




I can see why your friend is upset, said my new therapist on day thirty-four, but I don’t see the friendship as abusive. You’re not trying to get control.

I was sitting in an empty bathtub, fully clothed, both curtain and door closed for privacy. I am trying to get control, I said. I need to get control.

Control over yourself, he clarified, but not over her.

But he knew only what I had told him, and I hadn’t told him everything. I hadn’t told him that if I could move her fingers over the screen of her phone, composing texts and sending them to myself, I would. I would do that.

You’re here, he said. That’s something, that’s a sign of something.

My housemate’s ex had been in therapy. My housemate had told me this. Couples therapy and individual therapy, talk therapy and DBT.

At the advice of my therapist, I made a list of things I could do instead of texting the best friend—make tea, go for a run, listen to music, masturbate, do fifteen jumping jacks, tie myself up with rope, run again harder and longer until my mask was limp with sweat, take a bath, text a different friend, take a recommended dose of sleeping pills, watch a movie, get high, bake a cake.




On the forty-first day, they came to our house with a bandanna covering their nose and mouth. This was socially responsible, but also made them look more capable of violence. They stood on the sidewalk in front of our house, alternately tapping at their phone and reading  Mrs. Dalloway, which had become popular. I watched them from inside, waiting for my housemate to summon me. This was it. I would have to face them. But my housemate didn’t summon me. She stepped out onto the porch. They said, Hey. I got kicked out of my place, they said. Where am I supposed to go? It’s a fucking pandemic. Where do they expect me to go? 

They looked sorry and afraid. 

I could sleep on your porch, they said. I wouldn’t have to sleep inside, even. I could sleep on the futon.

You need to leave, she said. 

They reached out with one hand and touched our magnolia tree with gentleness. Then they broke a branch off the tree. Then they broke off a second branch. They snapped the broken branches into twigs like they could have built a fire with that green wood. They plucked three blooms from the magnolia tree and stepped on them while she leaned over the porch railing, saying, No, don’t, don’t do that, like she was talking to a dog.

I stepped out onto the porch and looked down. We had similar hairstyles—shorn on the sides and long on the top. We were wearing the same brand of shorts.

I said, We need you to leave.

They said, We?

We’re not together, she said. They just live here. She gave them a look I could understand only as a joke at my expense.

Leave, I said. 

And, with a wink at her, they did.




On the forty-second day, I texted the best friend, You’ll never guess what happened yesterday. I texted her, Someone was stalking our house. I sent her a text, paragraphs long, the whole story, ending with me telling the ex in no uncertain terms to get out of here, and them getting out of here. I waited two hours for a response. There was no response. I sent her a photo of the trellis I’d been concerned about, a photo of the damaged magnolia tree. I tried to imagine her receiving these texts. Was she reading them now? Was she on some long drive, out of service range? Was her phone dead? I tried to imagine her in the city where she lived, but I’d never been to that city. I couldn’t imagine her there. I sent her a text saying I hadn’t been touched in forty-two days. Then I sent her an upside-down smiling emoji. That night, she sent me a text, and I danced my thumb over the screen, shifting the notification left and right on the screen, not opening it.

Her text said, I’m worried I can’t respond quickly enough to your texts. Her text said, Time for me feels sort of thick right now.

Typical of her, to say something like that. I thought of taffy, the kind you really had to chew. I searched for GIFs of taffy and sent one to her.

She texted, All these texts make me feel depressed.

I texted her, I’m sorry. I don’t want you to feel depressed. Maybe we should talk on the phone about this?

She did not reply.




On the forty-fifth day, I downloaded an app that stops you from texting between the hours of 10 P.M. and 7 A.M. The problem with this app is that it is servile. When it opens to stop you from sending a text, you can simply swipe left with your thumb and it will without protest disappear for ninety seconds before opening again. In ninety seconds, if you are a reasonably quick texter and the texts you send are reasonably short, it is possible to send upward of twenty texts.




On day fifty-one, a person on the radio said, For many Americans, this is the defining crisis of our lives, but all I had done that day was eat sugared mango slices and write a list. The list said: I have never physically hurt someone. I have never threatened to physically harm someone. I have never screamed at anyone. I have never destroyed another person’s property. I have never stopped someone from seeing people they love. I have never forced someone to have sex with me. 

If anything, the list made it worse, because there were so many gaps. I could have spent the rest of my life listing terrible things I had not done, and there would still be things forgotten or left off because I ran out of time, things I hadn’t thought of or things I had done.




On the fifty-sixth day, I lay awake on the couch listening to a special about coral reefs, which was streaming on Disney+. I did not text the best friend. Then, in the next moment, I did not text her. 

I wondered if my housemate’s ex had lain like this on long sleepless nights before they came to our house. Had they considered instead making tea or masturbating or going on a long run? 

Tonight, were they lying awake on a bed or in a sleeping bag somewhere, not coming to our house? Were they thinking, Don’t go to the house, don’t go to the house? Or had they already given in? Maybe they were driving here even now to park beneath our magnolia tree. Maybe they had already crooked their fingers into the trellis, climbed to the second-floor porch, where the door was unlocked. Maybe they were at that door, reaching for the knob, their face bandanna-covered, their eyes glowing, their hands holding a goldenseal seedling or a handgun or a cat toy. I grabbed my phone and walked through the house, lit blue by the parrotfish scraping at coral. I went to the porch door. I peered through the window to the porch beyond. Its safety light was motion-activated. It had detected no motion. 

I opened the door. I stepped onto the porch, and the light twitched on. Against the futon the shadows thickened, as if someone were sitting there. I pointed my phone toward the futon like my phone could protect me, but there was no one on the futon. There was no one on the porch. 

But I considered this: At any moment a person could climb onto the porch. At any moment the person whose shadow it was could come and recline into its shade, shoulder the shadow like a tailored coat.

I appointed myself guard. Here was a useful thing, a good, protective thing I could do. I sat down across from the shadow, which had the limbs and proportions of a person. I said to the shadow, I can wait all night. Come sunup, it’ll be you in trouble, not me. I thought about the best friend, who, when depressed, hardlyslept. Possibly she, too, was lying awake somewhere.

The shadow sat on the futon as I would have sat on the futon—reclined against one corner, lower back supported by the armrest, arm slung along the back, one leg sprawling across to the other armrest, one stretched to the floor. I had taught myself to sit this way, overcoming the tendency bred into me over years of girlhood to constrain myself to one half, one corner of the futon, to curl with my knees tucked in or to bind my legs, crossing at knee and at ankle. The shadow sprawled as a man would sprawl.

Minutes passed, and they did not come. The porch light twitched off. I moved one foot, and it twitched back on. I pulled out my phone to check the time, then my fingers moved to check my messages, and in an instant I had texted the best friend—I can’t sleep.

I watched this text escape from the small drafting box at the bottom of my screen, private as my own mind, into the white space we shared. I imagined, somewhere, her phone chirping or jumping a little as if lightly shocked. I felt the shock, too, a flex of my stomach. I wanted to recall the text, but there was no way to recall the text. The text was sent. I put my phone into my deepest pocket.

But having sent one text, it was easier to send a second, and soon my phone was back in my hand, and I was looking at another blue box—I’m afraid. 

Having sent the second, it was easier to send a third—I still can’t sleep.

The light twitched off, and I stood, and it twitched back on. I went to the railing. The lights of the city across the river were beautiful. I pulled out my phone and sent her a photo. I wrote, I’m standing at the railing. I can see the city. 

Her response came immediately—How high up? Are you safe?

I could imagine her. So easy to imagine her now. She was gripping her phone. She was with me, fully with me, eyes on the screen, and I could have texted right away, I’m safe. I’m on the porch.
I could have let her go just like that, easy as that. Instead I texted, I think so.

She texted, How high up?

I waited as a car drove slowly down our street, passed our house, and made a right at the stop sign. It wasn’t the ex.

I texted, I’m okay. I’m on my porch.

She didn’t respond.

I texted her name.

Are you there?

Please.

Answer me.

Why won’t you answer me?

I tapped my phone on the railing twice, as if to fix it, as if it were broken, failing to do its job, failing to transmit the best friend back to me. 

My phone jumped a little in my hand. I nearly dropped it. 

You sure you’re okay? the screen said.

The rush hit me then. I put my phone down, held on to the railing with both hands, picked up my phone.

I thumbed into the box, Am I abusive? I pressed the arrow and watched the words issue up into the space where her eyes were looking also.

She answered quickly, almost immediately—I think certain elements of our friendship approach abuse.

I need to know yes or no, I thumbed. I have to know.

You promise you’re safe?

Yes or no?

I think this is a place where there’s ambiguity. I’m okay with that ambiguity.

I’m not okay with ambiguity on this question, I thumbed. I need a yes or no.

We can discuss this tomorrow.

It’s okay if I am just tell me. Yes or no?

Her three dots appeared, pulsed pulsed pulsed, disappeared.

Yes or no?

Yes or no?

I texted her name.

Yes or no or yes or no or yes or no

Her three dots pulsed pulsed pulsed dissolved—No. No I don’t think you’re abusive.

My whole body sagged. What should have been relief but felt instead like defeat. Okay, I thumbed. Thank you. I’m okay. You?

She didn’t respond. I stayed on the porch until dawn, waiting."

    "text": "At first, they talked only of  Sanfilippo. “I said, you know, thank goodness it’s not autism,” Jenny said, so exuberantly that it took Marion a moment to register the joke. 

“We thought Danny might have autism,” Marion said. They sat in Jenny’s living room, an untouched fruit plate on the coffee table. 

“When you think about the chances,” Jenny said. Then they were both silent. 

“Tell me how you’ve been doing with all this,” Jenny said.

“It depends on the day. And the hour.” This was the vague response Marion had learned to use. 

“I had an actual panic attack after we first found out. I really did. I was out in the parking lot, and I just couldn’t breathe. Justin took me to the emergency room,” Jenny said. “Can you believe it? This was less than a year ago. The director of our preschool was still saying, ‘Nothing’s wrong. She’ll catch up.’ And most of the time I believed her.” Jenny spoke as if they knew each other. Marion nodded in response. 

“What I really wanted was just something to totally knock me out, but of course they couldn’t give me anything like that,” Jenny continued. “I was pregnant. So all they’d offer me was a low dose of Ativan. Justin was so surprised I took it. I told him, ‘I have no choice.’ ” Jenny waved her hands and laughed as she said this. “Because I’d never done any sort of drug before.” 

Marion remained silent. “Are you thinking about the trial?” Jenny asked. “Of course you are—how could you not be? We’re all thinking about it.” 

“I was,” Marion said. 

It was for the trial’s qualification testing that Marion, her husband, Nick, and her son, Danny, now five, had arrived in Boston from New York that morning. The trial was for a treatment that could reverse the course of Sanfilippo—a treatment so untested its name was a sequence of letters and numbers: JTJ141. For three years, the question of whether or not Danny would be able to receive this treatment had formed the central preoccupation of Marion’s life. 

“But remind me when Danny was diagnosed,” Jenny said.

“At two,” Marion said.

“That’s so early,” Jenny said. 

Marion explained that Danny’s pediatrician had an unlikely familiarity with Sanfilippo. He’d seen in Danny’s face, in his forehead and eyebrows, the fate Marion had later learned to see. “We agreed to do genetic testing. But we didn’t believe him at all,” Marion said. Nick had, in his comically exaggerated, unselfconscious manner, pointed to his own large forehead, his bushy eyebrows.

They’d gone to the hospital to receive the results. She’d seen the size of the group that had assembled to meet them—multiple pediatricians, a geneticist, a social worker—and known it was something horrible. Danny would progress for only a year or two more, they were told; then he’d regress. He would die just before adolescence, if not sooner, bedbound and silent, having lost, one by one, every ability he’d ever gained. 

“I said, ‘There’s nothing you can do?’ ” Marion said. 

“And they told you it was a matter of symptom management.”

“Yes,” Marion said. They were again silent. Marion wondered when it would no longer seem rude to leave. 

“But you thought they were wrong?” Jenny said. It was Jenny who’d set up this meeting, having found Marion’s email address online. Was it friendship she wanted? Nick thought so. “It would be good for you to go,” he’d said to Marion. Healthy for her to socialize—that’s what he’d meant. At moments, he spoke as if he were her caretaker. 

“Or soon you realized they were wrong?” Jenny said, prompting Marion again. 

“I started reading articles about Sanfilippo right away,” Marion finally said. At first, she’d had to spend most of her time looking up terms: enzyme, heparan sulfate, siRNA. But eventually she’d discovered Dr. Hoplock’s treatment, which had cured the mice to whom he’d administered it, and learned about the clinical trial he’d failed to fund. She’d dedicated herself entirely to raising the $2.5 million, quitting her job—she’d been a lawyer—and working days, nights, weekends, forgoing sleep. 

She’d never been extroverted, had always hated attention, had not even wanted birthday parties for herself. She was still surprised that she’d managed to raise the money. It had been like throwing herself into a freezing lake and withstanding it, swimming. She’d become, even, a public figure on a very minor scale, appearing on various talk shows. She was attractive, she knew, skinnier than she’d ever been. She could recognize the value of this: an attractive mother got more interviews than an ordinary one. 

“It’s a specially engineered virus,” she’d say, “which is injected directly into the brain, and it contains within it the DNA—” The host would usually cut her off around this point. 

“What you’re basically saying is that this is a miracle.”

“Yes,” Marion would respond. “Yes, this could really be a miracle.” It was enough to wear the face she wore, of sadness and of hope, to say “miracle,” “gene therapy,” “my son”—this was what the producers wanted. 

They were right. There was a complex scientific explanation, but, really, it was a miracle. Administered the treatment, Dr. Hoplock’s mice had risen and walked again. She imagined mice near death opening their eyes, lifting up their heads. Mice like those in the children’s books she’d read to Danny, in dresses and overalls, alive and happy at the end of the book. A miracle, just when she most needed it, just when it had seemed her son would certainly die.




Marion had gone silent again. She tried to rouse herself—she mentioned the talk shows.

“I’ve just been so impressed with all you’ve done,” Jenny said. “And now here you are, in my house.” She held her arms out. “You’re the hero of this house. Really. I can’t thank you enough. For making this trial possible.” 

Marion looked at Jenny, who was frail and pretty, her eyes large and innocent. She probably had an eating disorder. Marion wondered if it had begun with Jana’s diagnosis or before. 

“We’ll have to hope they get in,” Marion said.

“But won’t Danny have an advantage?” Jenny said. 

“No,” Marion said. Dr. Hoplock had said he’d see what he could do. But there’d been nothing definite. 

What Marion knew about the qualification tests was that there’d be bloodwork, a physical, an MRI, and various behavioral tests. She knew that Dr. Hoplock would ultimately favor children in whom Sanfilippo was less advanced. 

Over and over, Marion had thought through all that Danny could still do, hoping that it would be enough. He could walk well, but ran unevenly. He could talk, sometimes in complete sentences, though more often now in two-to-three-word phrases. Marion would sing the songs Danny once had been able to sing himself, and he would fill in the words. “You think you lost your …” Marion would say, and Danny would respond, “love,” correctly.




A baby’s cry saved Jenny and Marion from their silence. Jenny’s husband, Justin, had left for the park with Jana before Marion had arrived, but John, the baby, was here—Marion had forgotten. She followed Jenny up the stairs to John’s bedroom, where he stood expectantly in his crib. He was healthy, Marion knew, not even a carrier.

“What I felt after Jana was born was that love was actually practical,” Jenny said, sitting in the rocking chair, arranging a nursing cover over her shoulders. “That it wasn’t just this romantic useless thing but that it got you up at night again and again. And now it feels useless again.” She laughed, as it seemed she often did, at her own misfortune. “Sit there if you want,” Jenny added. Marion didn’t sit as Jenny had suggested but stood at one end of the room, close to the door. 

“I was so sure Johnny was going to have it,” Jenny said. “I was seven months along. There was nothing we could do but wait to find out. Even though I knew there was a seventy-five-percent chance he wouldn’t. The odds had already been so against me.” 

The room reminded Marion too much of Danny’s old room—its blue walls, its wooden crib, the popular pacifier with an elephant on one end. 

“Do you ever think about having another?” Jenny said. “Don’t answer that if it’s too private. Since Jana’s diagnosis, more than ever I just say what I’m thinking.” 

“Nick would like to,” Marion said. “At least, he’s wanted to. I said no.” She wasn’t sure what he wanted now. A year ago he’d gotten on his knees to beg her to consider it. 

“And you’d do IVF?” Jenny said. It was the only way to guarantee a healthy embryo.

“Of course,” Marion said. 

“You should, Marion,” Jenny said, looking her in the eyes. “You really should. I mean it.” She paused. “That’s what I mean by just saying what I think.” 

“There were a few times I thought about it,” Marion said. 

“You’re worried it would be a betrayal,” Jenny said. 

“Yes,” Marion said. Why she didn’t find Jenny off-putting, she wasn’t entirely sure. Jenny was too open. And she could read Marion to an uncomfortable extent. 

“I was so happy when I found out John was healthy. I couldn’t stop crying,” Jenny said. “And then I would think of Jana and feel so guilty. Because John is my hope—it’s true. And I don’t feel like I should even feel that, much less say it to you.” 

“Maybe the treatment will work,” Marion said. And she was surprised to find she imagined calling Jenny, once Danny and Jana were receiving the treatment, and comparing notes. 




 After Jenny finished nursing, they went out to the backyard, and Jenny put a blanket down on the grass. 

“Where are you from, Marion?” Jenny asked her. 

“Oklahoma,” Marion said. “I don’t have a connection to it now.” 

“I’m from South Carolina,” Jenny said. “We’re both Southerners.”

“Neither of us have accents,” Marion said. 

“I trained myself out of it at Bain,” Jenny said. 

“I trained myself out of it in college.”

“Will you go back to law now?” Jenny asked Marion.

“I haven’t decided,” Marion said.

“Justin always used to say I was ambitious, but I’ve never felt like I was. I always felt like it was an accident.”

“It’s your perfectionism,” Marion said. Jenny’s boldness had made her bold. She’d seen the toys in their labeled boxes: FIRE TRUCKS, DINOSAURS, MAGNA-TILES. 

“Yes, that’s it. I have to be a perfectionist about the work, and that ends up looking like ambition. But I’ve quit now—did I tell you?”

“No,” Marion said. No need to ask why. 

They talked about therapy, which Jenny was in. Marion had very briefly seen several different therapists. 

“They don’t want you to make light of anything,” Marion said, imagining Jenny laughing her way through a session, her therapist gazing seriously on. 

“Yes, that’s it,” Jenny said. “As if I’m not taking everything seriously. As if I don’t understand my own life.” 

“Eventually I just decided—you can’t change the facts. They are what they are,” Marion said.  

“You think I should stop going, don’t you?” Jenny said.  

“How did you know?” Marion said, smiling. “What’s Justin like?”

“Well, he’s very handsome. I said to him—well, more to myself and only to him much later—‘I don’t know if I want to date someone as handsome as you,’ ” Jenny said. “But he’s also a very good person. He’s quiet.” Justin and Jenny were somewhat conventional, Marion decided. They fell along gendered lines—he quiet and serious, she bright and social. Jenny would express emotion for both of them, Marion thought. He’d be more stable. And yet Jenny didn’t seem entirely conventional. She was surprising, not boring.

“We met at business school. And that’s what he loves to talk about—business,” Jenny said. “I could have done something else, I think, but that’s really what he loves.” Jenny and Justin were still in love—that felt clear from the way Jenny spoke. Marion had wondered.

“And Nick?” Jenny said. 

“We met in law school. But he hates the law.” Marion had once assumed she would support him, whenever he moved on to some unprofitable, idealistic career. He’d talked at one point about starting a bakery. 

 “He’s kind,” she added. He meant to please everyone. He would have pretended to be interested in business around Justin, household organization around Jenny. He’d taken over much of the weekend and nighttime childcare some time ago, inventing songs and games for Danny, brushing his teeth, changing his clothes when he spilled food or water on himself, which now happened frequently. 

Nick had often wanted to sit with Marion to discuss the skills Danny was losing. All she’d wanted to do was work on funding the trial. And she’d hardly let him help with that—she had worked alone, in what she’d seen as the most efficient way possible.

“Do you think they realize?” Jenny said. She’d changed topics, but Marion understood. 

“I don’t think Danny does,” Marion said. “He’s generally happy.”

“Jana too,” Jenny said. “Marion, can’t we please stay in touch? That’s what I keep thinking to myself. You know what I’m sure of? That you’d understand me better than anyone else. I really feel that way.” 

“We will,” Marion said, meaning it. 

“You know who I have dreams about?” Jenny said. “Dr. Hoplock. Can you imagine? I have terrible dreams. Justin always says he should be jealous.” 

“You’ll get to meet him this week,” Marion said.  

 Jenny stood up to pull John back onto the picnic blanket. “He has a slow crawl,” she said. 

Marion thought about how she’d felt walking Danny around soon after his birth: surprisingly proud and pleased at the compliments. She’d been full of goodwill and human feeling, extraordinarily interested in the random people she met, as if since her childhood the world had grown more and more muffled but was now again uncovered and close, sounding in its full sound. 

And could Jenny see what Marion had become? How cold, how removed from the world she’d grown? 

“What was Dr. Hoplock like? I really want to know. I’m just so curious about this person who has so much control over our lives. We watched your interview, of course,” Jenny said. Marion and Dr. Hoplock had been on 60 Minutes together to speak about Danny and about the treatment.   

“I felt hopeful around him,” Marion said. As she did now. A hopefulness she almost never felt, which came over her entirely. “What a perfect day,” Jenny said, as if reading Marion’s mind. 




For Jenny, Marion would attempt to say more. She would try to describe Dr. Hoplock. “He seemed very distracted at first,” Marion told Jenny. She’d gone to his laboratory perhaps an hour before they were to meet with the 60 Minutes crew. He had promised her a tour. 

He met her at the elevators. He was bald and surprisingly muscular. He introduced himself and then went silent. He’s thinking about his work, she thought. She attempted to stand there as unobtrusively as possible. She wanted him to continue to think about his work. 

“You first,” he eventually said, smiling somewhat stiffly. 

“But I don’t know where to go,” Marion said. They stood before several doors. 

“That’s true—you don’t know where to go.” As if this were a joke between them. But then he led the way.

She walked among the lab’s long, cluttered shelves, its white countertops and boxes of gloves, its humming machinery, its wide-eyed microscopes and regular sinks, its room of freezers and boxes of frozen vials exhaling mist. 

“He was explaining the science to me,” Marion told Jenny. “He seemed to really want to make sure I understood it all. He was that sort of person. A teacher.” 

They’d then gone to see the device, a bed with a metal arc at its head and a metal ring above the arc, outfitted with the cannulas for eight needles. She imagined Danny on the bed, of course, his head shaved, eight holes drilled through his skull. Dr. Hoplock showed her how the metal ring might be clamped to the head and the mechanism by which the needles could be discharged.

“It’s because of the blood-brain barrier, right, that they go directly to the brain?” Jenny said.

“Yes,” Marion said. 

“You’ve done so much more research than me,” Jenny said.

“I’ve had more time,” Marion said. But she was surprised at how rudimentary Jenny’s question had been. 

For a period, she’d sat in Dr. Hoplock’s office. “What questions do you have?” he’d said to her. 

“Honestly, how do I explain this? I felt like he loved being able to say that,” Marion said. 

“He loved being able to be so magnanimous.”

“Yes, that’s it exactly. And so then I asked him a bit more about how he got into the work, and he said something like ‘What I knew is that I could be the person who saved people’s lives. By focusing on a disease like Sanfilippo.’ ”

“And, I mean, he’s right—we have to be grateful to him,” Jenny said. “We have to be so grateful.” She spoke with some hilarity. “He chose the right career.” 

“He also said something like ‘We’ve got to be there for the families, too. Not just tucked away here in the lab. That’s what some of my colleagues don’t understand.’ ”

“He wants to be uniquely caring,” Jenny said.

“But, of course, I didn’t care at all. Whatever personality he has—he can have whatever personality he wants.”

She’d been happy when the TV crew had arrived. She’d disliked being with him in his small office. She’d found all his attempts at connection unnatural.

There’d been nothing obvious, nothing crude. He’d smiled often, attempted to sympathize—all normal. As she was leaving, he’d said, “I’m only here to help,” in a way she’d found falsely modest. For of course his help was everything to her. He would have known that.

Marion took out her phone. “Look at this,” she said. She showed Jenny a series of texts Dr. Hoplock had sent her. “How are you doing tonight?” one said. Later: “Thinking about how strong you are.”

“He’s hitting on you?” Jenny said, and she smiled in the way she might have in high school or college, excited by the gossip. 

“I thought he might be,” Marion said. 

“What does Dr. Hoplock think? He thinks you’re going to fall in love with him?” Jenny began to laugh, and Marion joined her, though the texts had felt only like another difficulty. She’d had to carefully compose her responses. 

“I wondered about how I’d been looking at him,” Marion said. Perhaps that had given him the idea—the great need with which she must have watched him.

“I wonder how you were looking at him,” Jenny said, and Marion was startled. But Jenny, all brightness, went on, “How could we not look at him a certain way? How could we all not?” 

Jenny bent down to kiss the top of  John’s head. “I also tried to look into the scientific literature,” she said.  

“Maybe I found the only real promising lead,” Marion said. “Maybe there was nothing more for you to find.” 

“But tell me,” Jenny said. “Didn’t you think about it a little? About sleeping with him?” She looked at Marion. And Marion felt more than ever that Jenny could see what she normally concealed.

“No,” Marion said. 

“I’d better go change John’s diaper,” Jenny said, and Marion was alone. She again looked over Dr. Hoplock’s texts. Perhaps she’d made a mistake in showing them to Jenny. To her surprise, she’d gotten caught up in the moment. 




But it was normal between them when Jenny returned. “Tell me more about your parents,” Jenny said, John in her lap. They’d made it to Jenny’s parents when they heard the back door slam. At first, Marion could hear only Jana: “The ants go marching one by one, hurrah.” And then she appeared, sprinting toward Jenny, her legs perfectly coordinated.  

“This is Jana,” Jenny said, smiling at Marion. “I guess that’s obvious.” 

Jana was able to focus on Marion, wave, continue singing, turn back to her mother.  She reached six by six ants, then sat down next to John and very precisely and gently touched him on the head. It was as if all that day had been a mirage. It was as if Marion had let down her guard and in that time Danny had fallen behind, though in fact he’d been falling behind for months and months. Jana was almost exactly the same age as Danny.

“So your mom is from Greenville?” Marion said, trying to remember the thread of their conversation. Jenny was still talking when Marion said, as she’d been wanting to say, “I had better get going.”

“Are you sure?” Jenny said.

“I’d better get back to Nick and Danny,” Marion said. 

“Of course,” Jenny said. 

She’d meet Danny and Nick at the hotel room Nick had rented along the waterfront, thinking Danny would enjoy it. Nick would get Danny ready for his bath, holding up Danny’s arm and removing it from his sleeve—a task Danny would have had the focus to do entirely on his own not even six months ago. “Good,” Nick would say to Danny. “Good job.” 

“How did it go?” Nick would say.

“Good,” Marion might respond. Or she might say nothing at all, distracted, her mouth dry. Having grown more removed than ever. Having progressed beyond even what she had been. 

She found herself following Jenny through her back door, saying nothing.

Once—and now this seemed like a long time ago—the miracle had included total restoration. It had included not only Danny’s life but his intelligence. An intact, happy family, as if her life would always be waiting for her, right where she’d left it. 




 She and Jenny were winding their way through the house, John in Jenny’s arms and Jana somewhere behind them, when Justin called out to Jenny from the kitchen. “Is Marion still here?” He appeared between Marion and the front door. “Wow, it’s great to meet you. We really are so appreciative. We really are.” 

“Nice to meet you,” Marion said. 

“Pretty crazy that this is actually happening,” Justin said. “Can I get you something to drink?”

“I think Marion needs to get going,” Jenny said, her hand on Justin’s shoulder. “But you can make me a drink.” How had she managed to be less desperate? 

“Yes, I do, unfortunately,” Marion said. 

“Two spots for us, that’s what we have to hope for,” Justin said. Jenny had said Justin was quiet. Now he spoke so rapidly he was almost short of breath. “That’s what’s been hard. When those families who get diagnosed reach out to us, I mean, we have to tell them what’s in the works, and how amazing it is, and I could never not tell them to sign up, to try to get a spot, but the whole time you know what you’re doing, you know you’re making it less likely for Jana—” Justin faltered. “And it’s terrible to feel that way,” he added.

Or was Jenny just as calculating as Marion? 

“The other night Jenny was asking if we should try to work on the behavioral tests with her—” Justin said, looking at Jenny, but Jenny said nothing. “Weren’t you going to try to work on the tests with her?” Justin said, smiling. “We don’t really know what they are, of course. Do you know, Marion?” 

“No, I don’t know,” Marion said. But she did. She thought with despair of the person she’d once been.

“Marion wants to get going,” Jenny said, approaching, and Marion felt her intrusively before her. Jenny passed to open the door. 

“You’ll call us, won’t you?” Jenny said. “Of course, you’ll be here for the treatment. We know Danny will get in.” Jenny was smiling. There was something behind Jenny’s smile, something Jenny knew. At the very least, Marion thought, she knew Marion wouldn’t call. "

    "text": "Lately I’d become obsessed with sewing stuffed animals. I’d seen a bear in a store and thought it was cute, so I went to a hobby shop and noticed they were selling kits that included the yarn, needles, and other little things you’d need to make them. It seemed to be a thing. I made a frog that very evening, went back the next day, and bought more kits: a dog, an elephant, a cat … I made one every night until I’d made them all. Then I just bought yarn and felt and some buttons to use for eyes; I’d figured out the trick to it after about the fourth kit, so I wanted to try out my own designs. But apparently I’d lost any ounce of creativity I’d ever possessed, and the hippopotamus I sewed didn’t turn out the slightest bit cute. So I went to a bookstore, bought a Pokémon handbook, and then made one Pocket Monster after another, starting with Pikachu. I was so into my new activity that I forgot to sleep, forgot to eat, and out came Monster after Monster: Jigglypuff, Togepi, Psyduck, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, Eevee … but soon enough, I got bored with them too. So, thinking I’d try my hand at making a stuffed version of my PostPet, Momo, I turned on my computer for the first time in a while and saw that there were more than twenty emails waiting in my inbox. 

I’d been obsessed with PostPets at one point, too—these little animal characters who deliver your email. Most of my messages were from “e-friends” I’d made on the PostPet site; I didn’t know their real names and had never seen their faces. Their animals—bears, turtles, hamsters—would appear and disappear, leaving letters behind. The messages themselves weren’t of any importance, but the point was to make your Pets deliver and receive messages, so while I was never particularly gratified, I was never particularly disappointed, either. But that day, waiting there in my inbox was a bear named “Momotaro from Asuka’s House.” 

“I’ll be in Shinjuku next Saturday shopping for the Bon Festival, do you want to grab lunch?” Counting forward from the date on the email, “next Saturday” would be tomorrow. Maybe I should call, I thought, but I remembered how busy she was and decided to email a reply instead. “Whenever and wherever is fine by me.” Asuka called less than two hours later. 

“It’s been so long! How are you doing? I never got a reply, so I figured you were busy and decided not to bother you.” She seemed still unused to the idea that I had nothing but free time on my hands. 

“I wasn’t busy. How could I be? I don’t do anything.” 

I’d meant to say it lightly, but Asuka went silent, seemingly at a loss. I hurried to explain myself. 

“The thing is, last week I got wrapped up in doing something and it started to affect my sleep, so I fell behind on checking my email. It wasn’t a job or anything, but still.” 

“What was it?” 

“I’m sewing stuffed animals! Some of them have turned out really well, I’d love to show you.” 

There was no answer. I pretended not to notice and chattered on. “What time should we meet tomorrow? I’ll fit myself into your schedule.” 

Asuka sighed. “I don’t know whether to be happy or sad, hearing that from you of all people.”

We decided on a time and place. I found that I was neither particularly happy nor particularly sad. I just felt vacant. 

At first, the descriptor “Unemployed, Age 34” had sounded almost like a criminal charge, but I’d gotten used to it soon enough. Indeed, my ability to adjust so easily appalled me. Now I inhabited the identity—since revised to “Unemployed, Age 36”—body and soul. 

It had been two years since my husband told me he was divorcing me, which, since we ran his company together, meant I ended up losing my job too. Naturally, I reacted badly, but the period of angry protests and crying jags was really quite short, and I acquiesced to receiving my settlement and removing my name from the family register with an ease that surprised even myself. 

And so this life of mine, this life of uncertainty, simply continued, my state never dipping all the way into depression or desperation. Looking out the window from where I lay in bed, I could see the tall buildings outside shrouded by falling rain. It was July, but the rains had persisted. 

Six months earlier, I’d been obsessed with making elaborate outfits for teddy bears, and had ended up giving all of them to Asuka for her kids. It occurred to me that I could do the same with the Pokémon I was making, but the moment it did, I felt myself losing my will to create any more. I’d always run hot and cold, but now that my life was one of endless leisure, this tendency had gotten much worse. Giving yourself over to any old urge feels good, though. It was even possible that, against all odds, I was happy. 

 

 

The next day, I had lunch with Asuka in a restaurant located among the tall buildings I could see from my window. “This is for your little girl,” I said, handing her a paper bag stuffed with a Pokémon I’d made, but she didn’t seem as grateful as when I’d given her the teddy bear outfits. 

“Oh! It’s Pikachu, from Pokémon … uh, wow! Are you sure it’s all right for me to take it home?” 

“Oh, I just made it to kill time, you know.” 

I hadn’t sewn the thing with anyone in mind and was even thinking of getting rid of it on garbage day, so if she quietly threw it out, it made no difference to me. 

Asuka was a childhood friend, the only one from elementary school I still had. A working mother of two, she’d switched from part-time to full now that her youngest had started school, but she made room in her schedule to meet me every so often anyway. Before, I’d been the one who’d had trouble finding the time. 

“How are you? You’re looking a bit thin.”

“Really?” 

“Your color’s not good.” 

“I’m not wearing any makeup, that’s all.” 

I knew how bedraggled I must look, sitting there in this restaurant filled with tables draped in pure white cloth and decked out with cutlery of real silver. Asuka was simply dressed, in a summer-weight sweater set; her hair was neatly done and her makeup exquisite; a pearl necklace shone from her open collar. I was wearing a faded tee and a pair of cargo pants that were stretched out around the waist. I no longer bought clothes I couldn’t just throw into the washing machine. Asuka should have been the exhausted one, but there I was, not even bothering to hide the dark circles under my eyes. 

“Are you still collecting unemployment?” 

“Oh, no. That ended a while ago.” 

“Well, maybe it’s time to look for something, if only to clear your head.” I could tell she was choosing her words carefully, and I let out a bitter little laugh. 

“I will, I will. I have enough to get by for a while longer, I’m okay.” 

“Money’s important, of course, but it’s not the only thing …” 

She brought her water glass to her lips. I knew what I could say to placate her, but I decided on something else. 

“I’ve gotten tired of making the animals. I think I’ll try my hand at yukata this summer.” 

“You might as well carve erasers into little shapes!” 

I dropped my eyes to my plate. The atmosphere suddenly tense, we brought forkfuls of our fish dishes to our mouths. Then, Asuka got a look like she’d just thought of something. 

“Why don’t you make a website to sell them on? If you’ve made all these nice things already.” 

“They’re hardly ‘nice things,’ just silly knockoffs.” 

She didn’t even try to hide her sigh, seemingly deciding that no note she struck would resonate. A motherly smile spread across her face. “It’s not easy getting back on your feet, is it?” she said, gently. “I’m sorry. I’ll let it go.” 

I’d used to listen to Asuka’s worries about her job and family, but at some point I’d become the unstable younger sister. If I never went back to being the suit-wearing workaholic so busy I’d cancel two or three times for every lunch date we scheduled, would she ever see me as truly “back on my feet”? It was depressing to imagine being compared to my previous self and subjected to disappointed sighs every time we got together. 

I told her not to, but Asuka insisted on paying. Being unemployed means being treated to every meal you’re invited to. It wounded my pride at first, but it’s such a bother to put up a fuss that I just went with it. What would Asuka say if I told her that the friend she was treating to a fancy French lunch was jobless by choice and had twenty million yen in the bank? She’d probably leave it at, You’ll need that for your retirement, don’t waste it now. 

We parted, promising to email each other, and then, finding myself with nothing in particular to do to pass the rest of the day, I ended up going to a manga café. It wasn’t that I liked manga so very much, really; it was just that, after losing my job and my ambitions, I lost my capacity to read regular books too. It takes effort to follow printed words and understand them, to transform them into pictures in your head. 

There was one café in particular that I liked, on the second floor of one of those buildings filled with all sorts of little businesses that were changing all the time, what had been a lingerie bar becoming a massage parlor fifteen minutes later. Lately it seemed like every block had at least one manga café. For a while, I went around to each new one as they kept springing up, but it turned out to be one of the first I’d tried that had the most extensive manga collection and the most courteous staff. Their all-you-can-drink coffee wasn’t simmered into sludge, and since their prices were a little on the high side, the clientele tended to be a bit older; what really decided it for me, though, was the clean white sofa in the main room. 

That day, I found a complete set of Osamu Tezuka’s Buddha, the first few volumes of which had always already been claimed whenever I’d looked for them before, and I checked out the whole thing. Soon I was so engrossed I forgot to drink my coffee. After about the third volume, the thread of my concentration snapped, andI glanced out the window to find that it was already getting dark. 

The napping salarymen around me had been replaced by a growing number of young people who looked like students. Should I go home, or should I see Buddha to the end? I mused as I sipped my coffee. I’d eaten a proper lunch for once, so I wasn’t hungry, and it wasn’t like I had any plans. My eyes wandered over the shelves. I noticed Maison Ikkoku, its volumes in a neat little row, and remembered that I’d started that series once, back when I was a student myself. I’ll read that next, I decided, suddenly filled with the desire to hurry up and finish Buddha. I ended up staying late into the night, and walked the twenty minutes home surrounded by drunks all the way. 

 

 

It occurred to me that I’d never known the true meaning of having free time, what it really felt like, before. Sure, I’d been bored countless times—as a teenager, sitting in the class of a teacher exponentially worse than the one at my cram school; in college, unwillingly brought along to a singles mixer; working at an import-export company, trapped in meetings that kept dragging on, stifling my yawns as I pretended to listen while making other, more meaningful plans in my head. 

The meaningless and the meaningful. For a long time, I thought these were the only kinds of time there were in the world. In high school, all I’d had time to do was worry about entrance exams, but once I got into college, I started having a little fun; still, I never forgot to focus on the tests I had to take and the papers I had to write. Other students would ask to borrow my notes, and even though I knew they muttered behind my back about how much of a grind I was, I’d lend them out with a smile. Seeing those who’d mocked me humbling themselves to win my favor became my secret joy. 

I applied to a job at a midsize import-export company rather than a major one because I figured that would be the quickest way to become self-sufficient. And I was right—before long, I was given more and more responsibilities. It was obvious when my plans succeeded, as I could see the resulting profits, and I soon lost myself in the pleasure of the chase. I’d get an idea, and it felt like no hardship at all to do whatever it took to realize it—however much research, however much schmoozing, however many sleepless nights. None of that changed when I met my husband and quit my job to work with him instead. I loved working and hated being lazy. It was such a simple mode of being. I never wavered, not even once. Just before the divorce, my husband complained about my “empty, money-hungry” way of life, and at the time, I had no idea what he was talking about. 

Even now, I don’t see the satisfaction I felt then as some sort of delusion, but what had never occurred to me was that what I’d always considered solid ground could turn out to be so thin and fragile, a layer of ice. When it cracked, I thought I’d sink to a frozen death, but instead I found myself floating in the lukewarm water called “free time.” Lolling around in it was easier than I’d imagined, and by this point I’d lost sight of any motivation strong enough to drag me back out.

My dilapidated one-bedroom in West Shinjuku was drenched in the humidity of the season, and mold had begun to grow on the peeling wallpaper. The concrete walls were cracked, and the kitchen furnishings were shabby and cheap, but it was all mine, bought with my own money. My life here was so much more relaxed than the one I’d lived in the top-floor waterfront apartment I’d shared with my husband. When I left, I’d found this place advertised in a newspaper insert; with my settlement, I could afford to buy it outright, so I did. And I didn’t regret it, but looking back, I do wonder what I’d been so scared of that I needed to secure a roof over my head, no matter how rinky-dink. Surely I could have found something  better for the same price in the suburbs, but leaving downtown hadn’t even occurred to me. Living in a suburban apartment building surrounded left and right and up and down by happy, respectable families would surely have driven me crazy anyway.

From time to time I’d run into someone else wearing a T-shirt and jeans, waiting, like me, for the elevator, with a plastic convenience store bag hanging from their grip. Whoever they were I’d never know, since we studiously avoided exchanging pleasantries or even glances; like two couples running into each other at a love hotel, we’d scurry to escape each other’s sight as fast as wecould. 

Thinking I should turn on the air-conditioning, I rose from my bed the next morning and fished for the remote amid the drifts of dust bunnies and candy wrappers and manga weeklies. But as I went to activate the dehumidify mode, the numbers on the LCD screen faded before my eyes. Thinking the batteries must have run down, I took some out of my alarm clock and replaced the ones in the remote. Still, nothing appeared on the little screen. I pulled a chair over and stood on it to see if there was anywhere to insert batteries into the air conditioner itself, but I couldn’t figure it out. The television didn’t work anymore either, and neither did the light in the kitchen. I imagined all the things in the apartment breaking down like this, one after another, until I was the only thing left and ended up breaking down too. It felt like someone else’s problem, not mine. 

Ever since I’d left school, I’d had a mountain of things I wanted to do if only I could get a moment to myself, and now all I seemed able to do was waste my time. The business I’d run with my husband sold traditional handicrafts and things of that sort, and I’d longed to tour the various places where they were made. I’d wanted to get in touch with a tea master or flower-arrangement teacher to set up a little curriculum to give tourists a taste of traditional Japanese arts. I wanted to go to the gym more than once a month, I wanted to go to the spa for a facial, I wanted to travel overseas more often, I wanted to go shopping—if only I had the time. 

But of course, as soon as I had the time, these activities all lost their meaning. And as soon as I was no longer in a position to influence my husband’s business, the calls from everyone who’d been competing for my attention stopped coming. It turned out I’d felt the need to work out only because my husband liked to, and I no longer desired designer clothes, or treatments to preserve some portion of my youth. It turned out that the real me didn’t really like going out at all. 

Or maybe it was just that having all this free time thrust upon me had left me confused. Was the old me who’d so hated losing just exhausted now, asleep somewhere? Or had I been pushing myself too hard from the start, and this lazy me was my true self? 

I ate a burger at a nearby fast-food joint and headed back to the manga café. I poured myself a cup of coffee, piled the entire run of Maison Ikkoku on the table, and began reading volume after volume. I took one nap, went to the bathroom twice, and refilled my coffee three times. When I was finished, I looked up at the clock expecting it to be around ten, only to see that it was already past three. The café was filled with drunks who’d missed the last train home. I debated whether to walk back to my place. It had been unpleasant the night before, so perhaps it would be better to wait here until the trains started running again and cleared the neighborhood of stranded partiers. 

I left the sofa to get an anthology of light gag comics, and when I returned I found that the seat next to mine had been taken by a young, flushed, cataclysmically inebriated salaryman. Something about his sleep-slackened features seemed familiar. From time to time his brow would furrow and he’d moan softly, as if he were having a bad dream. As I stood there asking myself where I remembered him from, his eyes popped open. The moment they met mine, he blurted out an apology. The other customers looked over at us, at least the ones who were still awake. The flustered look on his face brought it all back—I knew exactly who he was. 

“Izumi? Is that you?” he asked. 

I sat down beside him without answering. 

“What are you doing in a place like this?” 

“What kind of guy starts apologizing as soon as he sees your face?” I responded. I’d briefly been his manager at the company where I’d had my first job. He was about five years younger than me, if I recalled correctly, and pretty incompetent—I remembered having to get on his case a lot. I couldn’t remember his name. 

“I was having a dream about a supervisor yelling at me, and then I open my eyes and there’s Izumi, looking right at me!” 

“Sorry about that.” 

“But really, what are you doing here?” 

There wasn’t any easy explanation to give, and I didn’t want to get into the real reasons with some guy I barely knew. 

“How many years has it been? Meeting you here like this, it seems like destiny or something, you know? Are you waiting for the first train out, too?” 

Almost everyone who comes to a manga café does so alone, and as a result, they’re usually even quieter than libraries. His alcohol-amplified voice was bouncing off the walls. Embarrassed, I rose from my seat. 

“Hey—you’re leaving already?” 

He followed me as I went to settle my tab. 

“It’s dangerous for a woman alone out there in Kabukicho at this hour. Here, I’ll get you a taxi.”

I turned my back to him, hurriedly pushing open the door to escape, but he hounded my heels as I descended the staircase to the street, and I ended up tumbling onto the sidewalk. I was dizzy. 

Rushing toward me, he reached down to help, and I found myself looking up at his face. It was youthful, puppyish. I grabbed his hand and let him pull me to my feet. There was a strange feeling in my chest—a little nostalgic, painful. 

“I’m pretty hungry. Should we go for ramen?” 

I realized two things as he asked me this. One was that the nostalgic pain I’d felt had been my pride, which seemed able to be wounded again after so long. The other was that the reason I’d fallen down the stairs was that I was famished. 

 

 

The guy’s name was Kenta Obara. Oh, that’s right, I thought as I looked at the business card he placed on the counter at the ramen spot. There’d been another guy in his department at the company named Kenichi Obara, so everyone called Kenichi “Big Ken” while Kenta, who was shorter and slighter, became “Little Ken.” The card indicated that he now worked at some subdivision of an appliance manufacturer, in customer service. 

“You quit our old company?” I asked as I slurped noodles into my mouth, since we didn’t really have anything else to talk about. 

“Yeah, pretty soon after you did. The supervisor after you was a hundred times stricter than you ever were, and I got so stressed out that I got a bald patch on my head the size of a five-hundred-yen coin. I thought if I didn’t leave I’d die, so …” 

You’d die, just from a strict supervisor? I thought, and Little Ken pointed his disposable chopsticks at me. “You’re thinking, God, what a wuss, aren’t you?” 

“I am.” I felt no need to observe common courtesy with him at this point. 

“I am, I’ll admit it. A loser, a whipped dog with his tail between his legs,” he said with a surprising amount of joie de vivre. “And what about you, Izumi? You got married, didn’t you? I forgot your new name, I apologize. I still remember your first name, though. Ryoko. Ryoko Izumi, I always thought that was a pretty name, from the first time I heard it.” 

Little Ken kept talking, and the amount of ramen in his bowl wasn’t going down. I’d already finished mine, and I wiped my mouth with a tissue from my pocket. 

“Hey, could I borrow one of those?” 

I passed him a sheet, and he noisily blew his nose before stuffing it into the pocket of his suit and going back to his noodles. I rested my cheek on my hand and watched him. His suit was cheap, his tie loose. But his nails were impeccable. Taking a peek under the counter, I saw that his bag looked old and beat-up, while his shoes were immaculately polished. 

“So, what kind of work do you do now?” I asked, ignoring whatever he’d been saying. 

“Customer service. Well, I spend most of my time listening to people complain, really, and dispatching guys to fix things. Sometimes I have to do the fixing myself. I get called up, yelled at, end up fixing the thing, bow my head, apologize. Just that, day in, day out.” 

He gave me another look that was less dispirited than his words, and then poured the rest of the broth in his bowl down his throat. For the first time that night, he seemed bashful. It looked like his drunkenness had cleared up a bit now that he had some food in him, and he wasn’t sure what to do next. 

“Is it okay if I ask you something?” 

I stifled a yawn as I nodded. 

“Where do you live? What are you doing in a place like this, at a time like this, eating ramen with the likes of me? Isn’t your husband going to be upset?” 

“I live in West Shinjuku, about a twenty-minute walk away. I’m eating ramen with you because you invited me, Obara. And I’ve been divorced since the year before last, so my husband no longer gets upset no matter what I do, or when I do it, or where.” 

I carefully removed any inflection from my voice, attempting to play it off as casually as possible. Still, Little Ken stiffened a bit. 

“It’s about time for the trains to start back up. You have work today, right? You should go home.” 

I tried to say this as sweetly as I could, but Little Ken was still blinking at me. Finally, he returned to himself a little and said, “Izumi, what do you do now?” 

“Nothing. I’m unemployed.” 

“No! The great Izumi … ?” 

I felt a twinge as my self-respect took another blow. We thanked the guy behind the counter, and Little Ken fumbled for his wallet. I told him it was okay, but to no avail: I was treated to yet another meal. 

 undefined

 

I felt the word loser, which Little Ken had used to describe himself, loom larger and larger in my thoughts. He was asleep next to me on my plain-Jane pipe bed, curled up against my side, hugging me. I’d opened my eyes to find myself in this position, clutched tightly as if by a child, and, unable to get up without disturbing him, resigned myself to staring at the ceiling. 

After the meal, Little Ken had insisted on accompanying me back home. “You know, I had a crush on you even back then, Izumi,” he said in a childish rush of flattery, and then grabbed my hand. I’d never had one iota of romantic feeling for him, but as he put my hand in his, I found it didn’t particularly bother me, so I invited him up to my apartment. As soon as we arrived, Little Ken began throwing off his clothes, and I thought, Oh, right, I guess this means we’re going to do it. We ended up going at it three times before we were through. 

It had been a while since I’d been touched. I couldn’t remember when my husband and I had had sex for the last time, and I struggled to recall how many years had passed since I’d been kissed, or had my hand held, my back stroked, or my shoulders rubbed. 

The simple truth was it felt good. It also gratified me to learn that I still had a sex drive at all. Little Ken nuzzled me along my collarbone, murmuring sweet nonsense into the hollow. Stroking his head was enough to quiet him. He really was like a dog. 

What time is it? I thought, and I stretched out the hand that wasn’t occupied with Little Ken to feel for my watch next to my pillow. It was a name-brand chronograph my husband had bought me one Christmas. My name was engraved into its back, so even if I’d wanted to sell it, I couldn’t; besides, it was a convenient enough thing to have around, so there I was, still using it. It was just past ten in the morning. We’d hardly slept at all. Little Ken’s head was heavy on my shoulder. I’d liked to sleep nestled in my husband’s arms, but I’d never realized how heavy a head could be. 

He was such a nice guy, I thought, remembering my ex-husband. He was the only son of a landlord in Shitamachi, with a certain absent-minded way about him, but he was a decent person. He was optimistic to his core, considerate and patient. Unlike me, he didn’t hold grudges and never had a bad word to say about anyone. I loved these things about him at first, but after a while, they began to wear on me. Had I become so inconsiderate because he was so easygoing? I’d started assuming the things that made me happy would make him happy too. 

Loser. The word danced behind my eyelids. Little Ken’s hair felt good against my face; I burrowed my nose into it and breathed deeply. 

Little Ken and I are perfect together, a perfect pair of losers, I thought, without a hint of malice or contempt. All it took was a bit of contact between my naked body and his to get me liking some guy I’d never given a second thought to. I struck myself as a bit ridiculous then, as well as a bit stupid. 

I began to hear a melody playing from somewhere. I didn’t have a cell phone, so it must have been his. When I realized it was the theme from A Dog of Flanders, I couldn’t help but laugh out loud. I was debating whether to let my sleeping dog lie when he sprang upright, eyes alighting on my face from time to time as they swam around the room. Finally, the phone ceased playing its little song. 

“Good morning! Are you really planning to skip work?” 

The Dog of Flanders theme began playing again. Dressed only in his boxers, he leapt from the bed to fish his phone from the pocket of his suit jacket on the back of my desk chair. He turned toward the wall and began apologizing earnestly to whomever was on the other end. I watched the bones of his skinny back as they twitched beneath his skin. 

“They’re pretty mad. I gotta go to work,” said Little Ken, with a hangdog look.

“It’s my fault. I’m sorry.” 

“No, don’t apologize.” 

He clumsily pulled on his shirt and pants, and then tied his tie. As soon as his suit was on, he was just another boring guy. He looks so much better naked, I thought as I put on a T-shirt to walk over to the refrigerator and get a bottle of water; I poured a glass and offered it to him. 

“Were you always this nice, Izumi?” 

I couldn’t help but laugh again. Perhaps sleep had rekindled my sense of resignation, but my pride no longer felt a whit of having been wounded. 

“Will I see you again?” 

“Sure. Hey, do you know how to fix a TV? Or an air conditioner?”   

“It depends on the model. Why, are yours broken?” 

Little Ken flicked the television on and off, peering at the distorted picture, and then took the batteries in and out of the air conditioner remote, his brow furrowed. He scribbled the serial numbers into his notepad. Then he ripped out a page, wrote down his cell number, and held it out to me. 

“You can call me at work too, but I’m out a lot, so use this number, okay?” 

I took the paper and nodded. Little Ken smiled, kissed me lightly, and bounced out the door. 

The moment he was gone, everything that had happened seemed to lose its reality, bursting like a soap bubble. When I crawled back into bed, though, his doggy scent was still there. Enfolded within it, I indulged myself in a lovely, indolent sleep. 

 

 

Toward evening, the phone rang and I answered, thinking it would be Little Ken. It wasn’t. It was a guy I’d known when I worked with my husband, and he was asking if I wanted to grab a bite to eat. 

Look who’s hot stuff all of a sudden, I thought as I put on my makeup. I picked out a summer-weight suit from the ones I’d packed away when I moved in, but it somehow no longer looked right on me. It wasn’t like anything important was on the line, so I swapped out the suit for my usual T-shirt and cargo pants. 

The place he’d picked was a fusion restaurant up in Aoyama, and to get there I’d have to pass by one of our old stores. When I turned east, I saw, with a bit of a flutter in my chest, that what had been the store was now one of those American coffee places that were popping up all over. I’d known it had closed, but still, it hurt to see it totally replaced. My husband and I had fought over whether to open a third store here. I’d been sure it would be an absolute success, but the sheer amount of the initial investment had scared him. 

I arrived fifteen minutes late, but, as I’d expected, the guy had yet to arrive. I ordered a beer anyway, and as I was drinking it he appeared, saying “Sorry, sorry, sorry” with an expression on his face that didn’t look sorry at all. This guy, Hyodo, sold Asian-style goods wholesale on behalf of a chain backed by a major apparel company. I was pretty sure we were around the same age, but he’d filled out a bit, gaining a certain presence. 

“Hey, you’ve gotten skinny while I wasn’t looking!” he said. He motormouthed his way through ordering drinks and food from the waiter. Had I spoken that fast back then, too?

“So, Izumi, what are you up to these days?” he said, cutting to the chase.

“Nothing in particular.” 

“I’d heard you were just banging around, actually, and the truth is, I asked you here to see if you could do something for me.” 

Hyodo produced a business card from the pocket of his expensive-looking suit jacket, recently tailored, no doubt, to accommodate his newly bulked-up frame. Unlike Little Ken’s, the card was pure white, its edges crisp enough to slice your finger. His new title—“Managing Director”—ran proudly down one side. 

“You see, we’re opening up a whole new location. We want to expand into traditional Japanese handicrafts and housewares, and I want you to help us make it happen.” 

He spoke as if the possibility that I might refuse had never occurred to him. The store was scheduled to open the following year at a major private railway hub, and he wanted to hire me as the merchandiser. I’d help shape the store’s image and how the goods were displayed, decide when we’d introduce new items and how many of each we’d order, and even have a hand in training the staff who’d work the floor. 

“I haven’t worked for two whole years.” 

“I’m confident that you, of all people, can make up for lost time. And you don’t have any obligations to your husband anymore, right? It’s payback time, Izumi.” 

Payback time—the words brought me up short. I had no thirst for revenge, but I was reminded that from the outside, it must look like something terrible had indeed been done to me. 

Now that I thought about it, it had been at a trade show of Hyodo’s that I’d first met my husband. I’d gone just to have a look around, but I was struck by the sight of a young man dressed in a kimono. I watched as he studied the catalogues and samples with utmost seriousness, and I took the first opportunity to strike up a conversation. He told me he wanted to convert the house he’d inherited from his grandmother, who’d passed away the previous year, into a store that would sell traditional Japanese crafts. When I’d learned the house dated back to the Taisho period, I suggested that he not renovate it at all but simply hang a traditional indigo noren over the door and use it as it was. His eyes shone at my suggestion. This encounter sparked the whirlwind romance that led to our marriage, after which we talked more and more concretely about opening the store. I didn’t have any particular attachment to the company where I’d worked for the previous six years. The prospect of marrying a nice guy and building a business together appealed to me much more than continuing to compete for promotions, playing what increasingly felt like a never-ending game of musical chairs. 

“Remember those little handmade animals, and the traditional Japanese candles? Those were great. Your ex-husband doesn’t sell those anymore, I don’t think, and I’d love to offer them at our store.” 

When I’d commissioned a young artist to make stuffed animals for us and developed a line of candles to go with them, my husband hadn’t been pleased; he thought they looked cheap. But I insisted, and they ended up selling better than either of us had imagined, even getting featured in a women’s magazine. Major department stores contacted us about selling them, too. Thinking back, I wondered if that had been yet another thing I’d done to wound my husband’s pride. 

“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.” 

Hyodo reluctantly put his mug of beer back down at my words. 

“Why not? I’m giving you a chance to get back in the game, Izumi. You know, if you stay out of it for much longer, everyone’ll forget about you.” 

“The thing is, though, I’ve never cared much about handicrafts or housewares.” The truth spilled from my lips before I quite knew what I was saying. Hyodo leaned in toward me. 

“But that’s the point! Look, there’re enough girls running around who love cute little things to hire and fire one every day. Loving the merchandise is more of a liability than an asset.” 

Faced with this unexpected response, I levelly returned his gaze. 

“You know what I mean, Izumi. A quality item and an item that sells are two completely different things. I’d love to deal in nothing but high-quality goods made by master craftsmen. But your average customer has no eye for that kind of thing. The things that sell are cute at first glance and cheap enough to use for a season, then throw away once you get tired of them. I’m not saying you should sell things just because they sell, but the fact of the matter is, if you don’t, when you do encounter something truly valuable, you won’t have enough capital to take advantage.” 

He said this as if he were enlightening a bright child. I’d said much the same thing to my husband, I recalled, and I knew I couldn’t make a living sewing Pikachu knockoffs all day, but his words still left me unmoved. 

My indifference must have been obvious, because he eventually went silent. Not bothering to hide his disappointment, he put a cigarette in his mouth and lit it. 

“It was that much of a shock then, huh? With your husband?” 

“What?” 

The group at the table next to us grew suddenly rowdy, drowning out his words. 

“I thought you’d want to get back on your feet, but it looks like I just brought up bad memories. I apologize.” 

“When do I have to tell you by?” I asked finally, staring down at the food I’d barely touched. 

“We don’t have to move on this right away, so let’s say the first of September? Think of it as homework for your summer vacation.” 

I should have been used to it, but when I saw Hyodo produce a ten-thousand-yen note from his wallet and hand it to the server, it bummed me out. The drinks from dinner started to make my head hurt; I hailed a taxi and took it straight home. There, I found a parcel waiting for me in front of my door. Seeing Asuka’s name on the label, I got a bad feeling, and when I opened it, I found not only the Pikachu I’d given her the other day but seven teddy bears dressed in outfits I’d made. 

“I know I should keep these to spare your feelings, but honestly, I just can’t bring myself to. I’m sorry. I don’t really know how to put it—all I can say is that taking a break and running away are two different things. It’s getting hard to watch. I’m truly sorry.” 

She could have just thrown them away without telling me, I thought, rubbing my temples. But as I looked at the stuffed animals arrayed before me, they indeed struck me as pretty nauseating. My mother used to crochet doilies to put under vases as coasters, and I remembered them striking me the same way. Nobody really wanted them, not even her, but still she went on making them. 

I shed my clothes without washing off my makeup and crawled into bed. I could still faintly smell the smell of my doggy friend. But I had no desire to call him. 

 

 

When I opened my eyes, it was eight in the morning, a shockingly respectable hour. Not only that, but the sky was clear and sunny again after I didn’t know how many days, so I threw open the windows and hung my futon and sleeping pad out on the veranda as I loaded the washing machine. In the sunlight, my apartment’s messiness stood out in stark relief, so I started filling a trash bag with all the stuff covering the floor. I plopped the stuffed animals into it, too, one after another, but when I went to close it up, my eyes met the perfectly round eyes of Pikachu. It did seem wasteful to throw out the plushies. Maybe I should at least take a picture before I get rid of them, I thought, and remembered Asuka’s suggestion that I make a website. I’ll go get a digital camera, I thought. 

Leaving the cleaning half-done, I walked to the electronics district and picked up a cheap camera. This emptied my wallet, so I stopped by an ATM. After withdrawing my customary hundred thousand yen, I glanced down at the receipt. The balance in my savings account was almost at zero. It shouldn’t have come as a shock that spending money while earning nothing would drain my resources; still, I’d never really given it much thought. All that time I’d spent studying harder than anyone else at school, working harder than anyone else at my job, and this was what I had to show for it. It didn’t look like I had a ⁠choice—I had to take Hyodo up on his offer, I told myself darkly. But I’d still wait until summer was over to let him know. 

The first thing I did when I got back to my apartment was boot up my computer. It was just a run-of-the-mill desktop I’d gotten before the divorce, but now I saw it came loaded with a rudimentary website builder. Not bothering to read the manual, I began to construct the index.html file for my site. 

 

 

Absorbed as I was in my new time waster, I spent the next week holed up in my apartment, leaving only a few times to get something to eat from the convenience store—until one night, after losing track of time completely, I heard a knock at my door. A deliveryman or newspaper carrier would have rung the doorbell, so at first I thought I was just imagining it; still, I stopped and listened, only to find that it really did seem to be the sound of someone knocking. Looking through the peephole, I saw Little Ken standing stiffly in his suit. 

His demeanor was hesitant, ultrapolite, a complete one-eighty from how he’d acted the last time I saw him. “I brought these,” he said, offering me the plastic bag he was carrying. It held two chilled cans of beer and two containers of shaved ice. 

“I didn’t know which you’d like.” 

“You could have called and asked.” 

“How could I? You never gave me your number.” 

Oh, that’s right, I never had. 

“Can you imagine how I’ve been feeling, Izumi, waiting all this time for you to call?” 

Little Ken sat down on the chair in front of the computer; I sank down onto my bed. Remembering the headache that drinking beer the other night had given me, I chose the ice. 

“You could have just come over …” 

“When you didn’t call me, I figured you must have wanted a one-time thing, Izumi. How could I just come over if there was a distinct possibility I’d be turned away at the door?” 

Little Ken was right, of course, but if I told him the truth—that I hadn’t called him simply because it had slipped my mind—it seemed likely to hurt him even more. 

“I’m sorry. I’ve just been a bit busy lately.” 

“If I’m bothering you, I’ll go.” 

“If you were a bother, wouldn’t I have turned you away at the door?” 

This finally got a smile out of Little Ken. He popped open his beer and drank it with gusto, then opened the second one and brought it to his mouth. I watched him, picking at my ice with its little spoon, and wondered if he didn’t seem to be a bit of an incipient alcoholic. Finishing the second beer in no time, he rose to his feet, saying, “Well then …” and reached into another large bag he’d brought, producing a small cardboard box. He opened it, revealing an air conditioner remote. He loaded some batteries into the device, walked over to the air conditioner proper, and flipped a switch; the exhaust fan shuddered noisily to life. A mold-scented breeze caressed my cheek. 

“You fixed it!” I exclaimed, to which Little Ken shrugged, exultant. 

“The battery case in the remote was rusty, so it didn’t work, that’s all. You need to take the batteries out when the season changes. And maybe clean your air filters.” 

“This is amazing!” 

I ran around the apartment, shutting all the windows. When I returned, Little Ken had moved on to the television, using a screwdriver to pop it open. 

“You’re fixing my TV too?” 

“It’s one of ours, it’ll be easy. But it might take a second.”

“Thank you so much! Oh, and can you replace the light bulb in the kitchen? I can’t reach it even when I stand on a chair, so …” 

“Of course.”  

“Can I do anything to help?” 

Sitting cross-legged in front of the TV, Little Ken considered my question as he fiddled with a part. 

“I wouldn’t mind a bit more beer, I guess.” 

“I’ll go get it!” 

I broke into a little trot on the way to the store. What are you so excited about, you idiot? I thought, but felt a smile spread across my face. When I returned bearing four beers and a few snacks, Little Ken was returning the television to position. The perfectly crisp image of a sportscast filled the screen. 

“Look at that!” I said, making Little Ken blush. 

“It was nothing. The color balance was off, that’s all. That, and it was pretty dusty. Dust can damage the set, you know. Can you tell me where the new bulbs are so I can change the light?” 

“Of course, of course,” I said, getting out the bulbs I’d bought almost half a year ago from where I’d stowed them in the closet. 

The kitchen filled with light, illuminating the empty instant ramen containers and dirty dishes in the sink. Embarrassed, I took Little Ken’s hands in mine and led him to the bed, where I sat him down and kissed him on the cheek. He smiled and pulled the tab on another beer. 

“Thank you so much, really. You saved the day.” 

“You’re very welcome.” 

“I’ll pay you back. New remotes don’t grow on trees, I know.”

“Don’t worry about it. This guy I know at the electronics store gave it to me real cheap. Anyway, you said you were busy lately? What have you been doing? Did you get a job?” 

“No, I’ve just been working on making a site.” 

“On the internet?” 

“Yeah. You wanna see?” 

I led Little Ken back over to the chair in front of the computer and showed him what I’d been working on. 

“Wow, it looks great! What’s that, a Pikachu?” 

“Yeah, I sewed him myself.” 

Sitting here talking like this, it felt like we were a real couple, Little Ken and I. 

“Look at the number of visitors! You could do this as a real job.” 

The sincerity of his praise dredged up complicated feelings. How hard was it to build a simple home page? I’d just looked at a few sites made by professionals, gathered the basic building blocks, and thrown it together. I posted links to it here and there and let my PostPets friends know about it, and someone had posted it on a forum somewhere without my asking. And that was it! I’d even received a few emails from people inquiring about how they might sell my stuffed animals and teddy bear clothing. But in truth, I’d already started to tire of the whole thing. 

I hugged Little Ken’s head as he sat. We pressed our lips together and giggled. I really am fond of this boy, I thought. But it might be the same as with my little sewing projects or my website—I’d get all wrapped up in him for a while and then just as quickly lose interest. I was helpless against my primitive impulses. I stripped down, sans shower, and we went at it again. 

“If you’ll forgive me for saying so, I think I like this Izumi better than the one I knew at work,” Little Ken said as we lay tangled in the sheets, naked, bathed in the cool breeze from the newly repaired air conditioner. It startled me a little. 

“Really? Everyone else seems to want me to get back on my feet, to be my old self again.” 

“Nah … I mean, when you announced you were quitting to get married, you looked so happy and so, so pretty. But before that, the things you’d say and the way you’d say them were so nasty and abrasive.” 

“You told me you’d always had a crush on me.” 

“Oh, I had a crush. You were a winner, unlike me.” 

Were a winner—the past tense caught my attention, but I decided not to think about it. I pressed Little Ken’s head to my chest like a stuffed animal and petted his hair. 

“Why’d you get divorced?” he asked, his voice muffled. I couldn’t think of an answer, and he quickly added, “If you don’t want to talk about it, it’s okay.” 

“You know something, Obara? You’re the kind of guy who really looks better naked,” I said, evading his question, and Little Ken let out a complicated little laugh. 

“Is that supposed to be a compliment? I know the suits I wear are cheap. I have to buy a lot of them, I walk around in the heat all day for work. I can hardly go around naked, can I?” 

I pressed my lips to Little Ken’s indignantly furrowed forehead, quieting him.

After that, Little Ken started dropping by on his way back from work once or twice a week. He’d come by on Sundays sometimes too, dressed in a T-shirt and Bermuda shorts, and fix the wallpaper where it was peeling or accompany me on a trip to the manga café. It was easy being with him—he never told me how much he liked me, or that he was in love with me, or asked how long I intended to stay unemployed. 

Summer in the city meant asphalt hot as a frying pan. I got woozy just walking to the convenience store. I spent all my time staring blankly at the TV or sleeping, the air conditioner going full blast. I had no appetite, but I’d eat a little of the cold Chinese noodles or ice cream Little Ken would bring, and somehow got by. 

By the time August rolled around, I was feverish. It was only to be expected after spending all day and all night sprawled beneath an air conditioner turned as low as it could go, and one night, Little Ken came by like usual and found me with a 102-degree temperature. Freaked out, he found a clinic that was open late and took me there. The doctor told me my immune system was weak due to anemia and borderline malnutrition, news that shocked Little Ken more than it did me. After the doctor warned me not to underestimate the problem and told me to make sure I ate properly, Little Ken forced me into a taxi and brought me to his place. 

His apartment turned out to be in a neighborhood about thirty minutes from downtown by train, and even though it was on the second floor of a rundown two-story wooden building, the area was tree-filled and green, and a lovely breeze blew through when the windows were open. He tucked me into his bed and hid the air conditioner remote. “It’s a good thing I had some vacation days saved up,” he said, and he ended up taking three days off, remaining by my side until my fever broke. He was no chef, but he cooked me three meals a day and fanned my forehead when I felt hot. I couldn’t figure out why he was being so nice to me. Sure, he’d said he was a “loser” in terms of his career, but he was handsome enough and amiable. Judging from what he told me, his supervisor seemed fond of him and his direct reports adored him. It seemed impossible that he would have no luck with women. So what did he see in me? 

My fever finally gone, I took a bath. The tub was old, but he kept it immaculate. There was a scale near the bathroom door, and when I stepped on it, I was surprised to see that I weighed eighty-six pounds. 

That Sunday, I told Little Ken that I was feeling better and should be getting back to my own apartment. A forlorn look clouded his face, and he offered to accompany me back to Shinjuku. “I feel bad enough imposing on you already—you can just see me to the station,” I replied. I was bursting with remorse for having cost him all his vacation time. 

It was ten and the midsummer sun was beating down as hard as ever. Little Ken suggested we stop by a park that was thick with trees, their shade offering cool relief. 

“I don’t think that apartment in Shinjuku is very good for you,” he said, taking a sip from a can of iced tea. 

“Good for me or not, I bought it. I can’t very well move now.” 

“It feels cursed, that place.” 

“Don’t be creepy!” I replied, meaning to make him laugh, but his face, in profile, remained serious. 

“I’m not sure quite how to say this, but …” 

I braced myself, trying to think of what to say if he asked me to move in with him. 

“When you first came to my place, Izumi, I couldn’t stop worrying, and I ended up going to see Big Ken, back where we used to work.” 

“You what?” 

“It’s not cool, I know, but I ended up asking him about you. He told me everything. It’s been pretty tough for you, hasn’t it?” 

It was a small world, the business I used to be in. Rumors get passed around, and the story of my separation had surely become festooned with unflattering embellishments before long. 

After all, there was no linear progression that led to my husband asking me for a divorce. It had come down simply to my insistence on dominating every little thing to do with the business. After the success of the stuffed animals and Pop art–inspired Japanese candles, we started stocking cheaper, mass-produced goods, and business grew by leaps and bounds. I’d pressed my husband to open two new locations, and he’d begun catching flak from old friends and members of his family: “I can’t believe you’re selling crap like that, what happened to your eye for quality?” I knew more or less what was going on, but I chose to pretend I didn’t. I wanted to have children and knew I couldn’t while working morning and night; to prepare, I wanted to sell as much as possible as quickly as possible, and I did everything in my power to raise our profits by every measly yen I could. 

And indeed the profits rose steadily, but things between me and my husband grew more and more strained, and the prospect of going back each night to the apartment my husband had bought with his parents’ money started to depress me. I knew I shouldn’t have, but I spent more and more nights camped out at the store. And it’s true, too, that I began to think of him as a spoiled rich kid, a man who didn’t understand business, not really much of a man at all. 

How fortunate for me that he ended up being the one to have an affair. His mother taught traditional Japanese dance, and she attracted a steady flow of young women to her classes through word of mouth. It was one of these students who ended up falling in love with my husband. She’d come to the store countless times, and despite her ultrashort modern haircut, she looked great in a kimono—the effect was, in fact, not unlike what had so attracted me to him at that trade show. 

So, by the time he told me that he knew he could build a life with her that was full and rewarding—unlike the profit-obsessed one he was living with me—he’d already made up his mind. He prostrated himself, promising that he’d do anything I wanted so long as I agreed to remove myself from the family registry. Even as I screamed and cried, vowing I’d never give him the satisfaction, I knew in my heart it was over. “I can’t take the loneliness anymore,” he said. 

I didn’t know how much Big Ken knew, but it was clear that whatever Little Ken had heard made him feel extremely sorry for me. Despite having recently returned to its previous state of numbness, my pride smarted. My stupid, useless pride. 

“Maybe I’m worrying too much, but are you sure you don’t want to rent a little place near here with me?” 

Little Ken and I grew silent. The buzz of the cicadas, the smell of the earth. The light, filtered through the leaves, moving across Little Ken’s flip-flops. 

“You know, a guy I used to know asked me recently to join the staff of a new store his company is opening up,” I said, finally. 

“Really? That’s great!” he answered happily, as if he’d been informed of his own good fortune. 

“But I don’t know—part of me wants to do it, part of me doesn’t.” 

“Well, with everything that’s happened, it’s natural to have mixed feelings …” 

“That’s not it,” I said, more sharply than I’d meant to. Little Ken’s eyes widened. I knew that sooner or later, I’d finally get back on my feet, rejoin society, and go back to work. I’d have my doubts, but even so, I’d start to strive again, push harder and harder. It made me sad to think about. It was the human condition to stumble and fall, to get hurt and then heal and get up again to fight another day. And I hated it. At some point, I’d begun to despise the very capacity of my heart and body to heal themselves and move on. 

“I mean, when I get busy again, I won’t have all this free time to hang around with you like I’ve been doing.” Crap, I thought, as soon as I said it. 

“So you’ve only been with me to pass the time?” he said, staring down at the ground. 

“That’s not what I meant.” 

“It’s all right. I get it. Once you get back on your feet and start working again, what would a nothing guy like me have to offer?” 

“No,” I said, but Little Ken got up and threw his empty can away. I found I lacked the voice to call after him as he fled down the path we’d been walking together, hand in hand, just before. 

 

 

I’d never spent as much time waiting for someone to call as I did then. But Little Ken never got back in touch, not after three days, or seven, or ten. The night I made up my mind to bite the bullet and call him myself, I couldn’t find the slip of paper he’d written his number on, no matter how hard I scoured my apartment, and finally I gave up. It was just like he’d said, I supposed. If it weren’t, there’d be no way I’d have lost his number. 

The next day, my phone rang; I clamored to answer it, but it turned out to be Asuka. She kept apologizing for some reason. I was at a loss, unable to figure out what might have prompted this, until I remembered the stuffed animals she’d sent back to me. 

“I sent you so many emails and you never replied, so I figured I must have really upset you.” 

“It’s totally fine,” I said. “I even ended up making a website.” Hearing this seemed to calm her down. We’d had I don’t know how many fights since we were kids, but none were ever bad enough that we couldn’t make up afterward. 

“I can’t believe I’m saying this after doing something so mean, but I have a favor to ask,” she said. “Would you mind helping my kids with their summer homework?” Her husband usually helped the kids complete their projects for art class during the last days of August, but this year, he’d been called away suddenly on business. “He’s so good with his hands, but I’m utterly useless. I have work all day, too, so I just don’t know what to do.” 

I hadn’t seen Asuka’s kids in more than five years. Kids weren’t exactly my strong suit, and I kind of felt that children should be expected to do their homework themselves, but there wouldn’t be much pressure with her husband gone, and this seemed to be Asuka’s way of extending an olive branch. It’s got to beat languishing in this awful apartment all day, I thought. 

The children wanted me to show them how to make the animals their mother had mysteriously taken away, but it seemed impossible to teach a couple of kids something so complicated in only a few days. I figured a teacher would respond better to something a bit more childish anyway, so I looked up how to make papier-mâché and headed to Asuka’s place. 

Her apartment was located in a long row of high-rises an hour by express train from the city. It was about the same size as the place I’d shared with my husband, but it housed a family of four, not two. 

Her eldest was already in sixth grade and quite the little adult, greeting me formally as I walked through the door. Her younger child, Rinko, was in third grade; bashful and quiet, she squirmed nervously behind Asuka’s skirt. As Asuka and I had tea, her son showed no hesitation in coming up and talking to us, asking if he could play video games or if we could help him with his math homework. Rinko, on the other hand, sat silently in the far corner of the room, sneaking peeks at us every once in a while. Kids, whether they were in your face or left you alone, were such a nuisance. But it was only two days, after all, and Asuka seemed so grateful. 

You can buy papier-mâché premade at the store, but I figured the process was part of the fun. As I was starting to cut the paper into strips, the girl sidled up to me and said, “Can I try too?” 

“It’s your homework! It wouldn’t be right if you didn’t help out.” 

I handed her the newspaper and the scissors, and she started cutting away. We put the strips in the water to soak, boiling them in a big pot. That was as far as we got, and I joined the kids to eat the dinner Asuka made. I ran a bath before going to bed and saw on the scale that I’d gotten my weight up to ninety pounds. 

The next morning, after Asuka left for work, we added flour and water to the newspaper that had transformed overnight into mush. This seemed to interest the boy more than the girl; “I’ll do it,” he informed me before stirring the mixture. Once it was ready, I went about covering a bowl in plastic wrap and carefully spreading papier-mâché across the surface. When I removed the bowl, the papier-mâché kept the shape, and the kids responded with glee. 

The boy dove right in, making things like monsters and cars and fake poop, but his sister seemed at a loss. I got out some other dishes so she could try using them as molds, but she wasn’t very good at it. Despite their clumsiness, I found the shapes she made endearing, and I set them aside without trying to fix them. Before long, the boy went to go play with a friend, leaving the girl and me alone to decorate the objects with acrylic paint. Little Rinko’s sense for color turned out to be excellent. She painted patterns onto the bowls she’d made, and they turned out very nicely; she seemed like an old hand at holding a brush. I told her how well I thought she was doing, and she smiled bashfully in response. 

“You’re the one who made Pikachu for us, right?”  

We were sitting in the living room, painting our creations atop newspapers laid down to protect the carpet, when she whispered this question to me. The room had grown hushed and still. 

“I liked him, but Mom took him away. She said she only borrowed him and we had to give him back.” 

“If you want, I can give him to you,” I said, and she looked thoughtful. 

“Was he hard to make?” 

“Pretty hard. Have you used a needle and thread before?” 

“No.” 

“Well, I’ll show you how next time.” 

Her eyes shone. 

“You really think I could do it?” 

“Of course.” 

We finished painting her pieces, and when her brother got home, we made him paint his, too—his monsters, his cars, his poop. His sense for color was pretty bad, as it turned out, but it was just an elementary school project: the nature of the beast, I supposed. 

The girl seemed to have completely overcome her initial wariness and insisted that she accompany me in the bath and that we sleep in the same bed. “Don’t be a pest, Rinko,” admonished Asuka, but I was delighted. I didn’t feel as if I’d acquired a child of my own, though; it was more like I’d become another one of Asuka’s. 

And so I found myself snuggled beneath a blanket with little Rinko, in bed at the unbelievably responsible hour of nine o’clock. After turning off the bedside light, Rinko buried her face in her pillow and said, “I gotta go back to school tomorrow.” 

“You don’t want to go?” 

“I do! I do! I made all that stuff, I want to show everybody!” 

I thought for a moment and then asked, as I stared up at the ceiling, “Why go to school at all?” What elementary school kid’s going to have an answer for that? I wondered. But little Rinko did. 

“It’s fun. And I get to see my friends.” 

As I pondered how to reply, she dropped off to sleep. Both her arms were wrapped around me, as well as one of her legs. It was awfully hot to be hugged so tightly by a child. Her hair smelled faintly of the watermelon we’d eaten after dinner. 

I closed my eyes and recalled spending summer vacations with Asuka. In elementary school, she’d been small and weak, and boys had often picked on her and made her cry. I would grab the boys and beat them up for her. But I was the one who’d end up crying more than she ever did, what with my parents, who never so much as smiled at me unless I was showing them a glowing report card. Asuka had always been there to hold my hand, to comfort me. 

Today was the last day of my summer vacation, too. I still hadn’t decided how I’d answer Hyodo. At my age, could it really be a simple matter of fun, of getting to see my friends? I wanted to talk it over with Little Ken. But he surely hated me now. I wanted to stop by his place unannounced, but I was afraid I’d be turned away at the door. 

I held my friend’s child tight against me and began to cry. My tears begat more and more, until my weeping turned into wrenching sobs. I sensed that the child had woken up, startled by my outburst. 

 “Mama, Mama, she’s crying!” the child called out, in a voice that edged into a tearfulness matching my own. I listened to the sound of her steps as she fled to her mother for rescue. "

    "text": "The building, a brick row house, was only a few blocks from the subway, and Amy got there first. A rose had been left on the stoop, laid vertically on the slanting top of one of the stubby walls that descended on either side of the steps. Against the soft old auburn sandstone, the velvet petals almost glared. Maybe the person who had bought the flower had reconsidered, Amy thought. Or maybe the person the flower was given to had.

The woman from the university’s real estate office was wearing a tight skirt, which kept her steps shallow. “You said you don’t mind a first-floor unit?” she asked as she walked up. This was their third try.

“It doesn’t face the street?”

“It’s very quiet. It faces away.”

Classes started in a few days. Amy, who was going to be a first-year at the law school, needed to make a decision soon.

A man still grimacing his face awake, his hair wet and just combed, approached. “Unit one?” he asked. He seemed to be the super.

One as in year one, Amy thought, as the super unlocked the front door. When she had first started looking at apartments, she had had the sense, as she ran taps and flushed toilets, that she was mimicking George, the man she was trying to learn to think of as no longer her husband, since soon he wouldn’t be. The way that, if she ever went looking for a used car, she would probably kick the tires because, when she was a child, she had seen her father kick them. Maybe her father hadn’t known why he did it, either. A couple of months ago, at the green market—was it before or after George’s announcement?—she had overheard one woman ask another why the two of them were peeling open the tops of the ears of corn in their hands. The second woman had laughed and suggested, uncertainly, “Bugs?”

“It’s to see if the kernels have been fertilized,” George said when she brought the story home. He always knew, even though he didn’t like it when she expected him to.

In the lobby, a bricked-up fireplace faced a staircase with a stately curvature. Once upon a time the building must have been a single-family residence. Beyond the fireplace was a door freshly painted an institutional green, in the center of which hung a new brass fixture, a combination knocker and peephole. Above the dead fireplace, a mirror reflected a lamp without a shade, which cast a rather stark light, in which the knocker and peephole shone as bright as the buttons on a little boy’s blazer. 

“I put in a stronger bulb,” the super said, it wasn’t clear to whom. He said it almost apologetically, nodding at the lamp as he looked through the keys on his ring, turning them over one by one like playing cards. 

Because Amy had barked at George’s polite questions lately, he had stopped asking them, and so when the door swung open and she saw inside, she was looking for herself only. She wasn’t going to be giving anyone else a report on the white blankness of the walls. On the strong, almost gasoline-like smell of the recently polyurethaned floor. 

Along the left wall ran a strip of moulding at hip height, as white as the wall it divided. Along the right stood a sink, six inches of countertop, a gas stove, and a refrigerator. Past the sink a door led to a bathroom; above the sink were shelves.

The super crumpled a piece of paper that happened to be lying on one of the shelves and shoved it into the pocket of his hoodie. 

The saving grace was the light, which fell in through frosted panes in a door in the rear wall. A floor-to-ceiling steel accordion grille barred this door, chopping the light into diamonds. Light also came in through an unfrosted window in the same wall, protected by a cast-iron grille whose bars swooped out, in a belly-like shape, in case anyone ever wanted to install an air conditioner. The door grille, which was inside the unit, had been sloppily painted the same white as the walls, but the window grille, which was outside, had been painted black.

Through the window a yard was visible: a rectangle as narrow as the building, extending straight back, with a faded wooden fence around its perimeter. It could have held a garden and maybe a picnic table, but it didn’t. Instead, in the seams between concrete flagstones, a grid of thin weeds was seeping up. Beyond the flagstones, more weeds were grappling for a foothold on hillocks of white-flecked, gravelly dirt. There were a few piles of cinder blocks and cracked bricks. A tub lying on its side had once held roof tar, according to the printing on it. There was a caved-in basketball that had gone yellow from sun, and a gray sheet of plywood that was splitting. A tree of heaven careened diagonally. 

“Can we go outside?” Amy asked.

“That door hasn’t opened since at least three coats of paint ago,” the super said. 

“Oh, look. A tomato,” Amy noticed.

“People throw all kinds of things out the window,” the super said.

“No, I mean a tomato plant. It’s growing.”

“Really?” the super asked. He looked over her shoulder.

The plant was poking up from inside the hollow of one of the cinder blocks. It had a couple of small whitish fruits. Its gingerbread-work leaves were already yellowing.

“We can put up blinds for you,” the agent suggested.

“They should be up already, to be honest,” the super said.

“Is there a closet?” Amy asked, realizing, as she asked, that there couldn’t be. There was nowhere for a closet to hide.

She took the place anyway.




“Do you think it’s safe?” George asked, when she did give him a report after all. 

A student had been killed on the campus in the spring, a woman in her first year at the law school, and both George and her parents, who had read about the crime on news sites at the time, went through bouts of being worried about Amy’s living there on her own. But the woman had been killed by people she knew; it could have happened anywhere.

“The windows have all these bars on them,” she said. “It’s like jail. A sunny jail.”

“You know you can stay here longer if you need to.”

Her first week at Ann Arbor, she had been curious about the thin white diagonal scars, almost like a geometric tattoo, that she had noticed on the slender knuckles of a boy in Yeats and His Circle, a seminar she went to the first class of but didn’t get into. As if a skeleton had briefly rested its fanned-out fingers on top of and across the boy’s. “Where are you from?” she had asked, with the courage sometimes available to shy people in a new context. She had grown up on the Upper Peninsula, and it turned out that he had, too, in a town only seven miles away. He didn’t get into the seminar, either. She never found a way to ask about the scars directly, and it wasn’t until they were driving home together for the Christmas holidays, an established couple, and he gave her one hand to massage while he kept the other on the wheel, that he told her he had gotten them in an accident with a table saw. He had been cutting a piece of wood that had had tacks in it. The heads of the tacks had rusted off, making the teeth still embedded invisible until the blade spun them into his hand. It’s pretty, though, she said, splaying her fingers out where the skeleton’s had been.

After graduation, they moved to New York, got married at city hall, worked as a waiter (George) and a grant writer (Amy), and got into the same law school. He delayed coming out to her until the summer before they were supposed to start, and during the long conversations that followed, he offered to defer for a year and she offered to let him keep the Brooklyn apartment, so that each of them could have breathing room, and so that she could at least have a running start. Could take at least that much back. He had taken only fifteen months from her. Or six years, depending on how you counted. Everybody said she was so young, and that she still had plenty of time to start over. When he mentioned, however, that he didn’t mind delaying law school, because there was so much for him to get used to, because it was a whole world, she did manage to tell him—a therapy account she followed on social media suggested that it was okay to stand up for oneself in such situations—that she didn’t want to hear that part.

For the new apartment, she ordered a desk, wardrobe, and bed frame in cheap blond-wood veneer, as well as the same mattress that she had picked out for George and herself two years earlier, and one of the same pillows. On a rainy Saturday, she waited alone in empty unit one for the deliveries. She had brought with her a suitcase of clothes, a backpack of books, and a bright yellow Amazon-delivery bag containing half their sheets, towels, dishes, and kitchen utensils. She had wrapped the dishes in the towels, and the towel on top had gotten a little damp in transit, so she hung it on the rack in the bathroom. She knew she was going to be too busy to reread the books; bringing them was a piece of sentimentality. On the other hand, not having any time for herself, not having a life, was going to be a mercy, probably, in a way.

There is a nothing sound that rooms make that is easier to hear when a room is empty. A sort of reflecting in on itself of the room’s size and angles. Outside, rain was hitting the split plywood, the cracked bricks and blocks, and the droopy mustaches of the ailanthus leaves. Inside, the refrigerator maundered reassuringly. It was when the refrigerator gave a little wheeze and then fell silent that you could hear the nothing sound best. The sound of waiting. Leaning against a wall, she tapped through photos that old friends were posting of their late-summer vacations. Of last visits to beaches on the lakeshore. Of a baby. Of another baby.

Was she sure the doorbell worked? She opened the apartment’s heavy green door, which was metal—that was nice—and stood in the doorway. Across the dark lobby were the two sets of glass doors at the building’s entrance. Through the glass there were only the same slanted gray slicings in the air that the rain was making in the yard in back. 

The lamp on the mantel in the lobby was off. She was pretty sure it had been on when she arrived. She already thought of the lobby as in a way hers, since there were no other units on the first floor. Checking that her keys were in her pocket, she let the apartment door shut behind her.

The fireplace and the bricks that were blocking up its mouth were painted a uniform black. The lamp was art nouveau or anyway had been when it had still had a shade, and running down the stem and spreading across the base were veins or rootlets chased into the metal. Or maybe the ornamentation was meant to represent dripping wax. She found a knob on the stem, which she turned until it clicked.

The lamp didn’t go on. Because it was a rainy day, the shadows in the lobby were soft. Edgeless.

At the foot of the stairs, she found a switch on the wall that did the trick. The light was unpleasant—jagged and brusque. Suddenly there was a thud.

A delivery person in uniform was shading his face against the glass of the front door, a heavy package loosening itself from his arms.




George had promised to come over at the end of the day to help her put together whatever she wasn’t able to put together herself.

She finished the wardrobe and bed frame on her own and was even able to walk the wardrobe into place against the wall, its large back piece of wood quivering and echoing as she did. When she finished putting together the desk, however, it was upside-down with its feet in the air, helpless the way an insect in that position is helpless, and she decided to wait for George before she tried to right it.

“That’s it?” he asked, once they’d swiveled the desk right-side up. He also helped her slide the mattress out of its plastic wrap and onto the bed frame.

“I guess I never really needed a husband.”

“Oh, slay.”

“I’m not sure that’s how ‘slay’ is used.”

“Fellow kids,” he intoned, which was shorthand for a joke they quoted to each other whenever one of them seemed out of touch with the way the world was changing.

She was going to miss talking to him. Whenever one of them was in the kitchen cooking, the other used to come in, too, to talk. But maybe it was just as well she was going to be on her own, because in the months to come she was going to have to figure out how to use minutes like those for studying. There were going to be a few weeks of Civil Procedure, which was supposed to serve as a sort of introduction to studying law, and then her first semester was going to be Torts and Contracts. It wasn’t entirely clear to her what torts were, but she gathered that they were things you were supposed to know not to do even though no one had specifically and personally told you not to, and that contracts, meanwhile, were things you weren’t supposed to do because you had said you wouldn’t. The two genders, to adapt another of their favorite memes. The two ways of fucking up a marriage.

“Let me order Indian food,” she offered.

“You don’t have to do that.”

“I would order Indian food for a friend who helped me put my apartment together even if he wasn’t my husband.”

“Do you have a screwdriver?” he asked, taking one out of his knapsack. “Why don’t you keep this one.”

He said it as if it were a gun that he was leaving her.




That night, lying alone in her new bed, looking up at her new ceiling, which was an old ceiling, she wondered why the super had sounded apologetic about the new, brighter light bulb. It wasn’t as though it could shine into her apartment through the wall. The refrigerator struggled and then gave up, in the rhythm she was already becoming used to. Then it gave a few clicks. And then the clicks stopped, too. There was a sort of breath from the window, not quite a breeze; she was going to have to buy a fan. 

It was strange, too, that someone had turned the light bulb off. Who would do that? She hadn’t met any of the other people who lived in the building yet, but she had heard a few times the cronch, cronch, cronch of their footfalls going up the stairs, followed by the delayed clumphs of the front doors swinging shut behind them. It occurred to her that if they were able to reach the stairs before the front doors shut, then it was possible for someone to walk in behind them without their being aware of it. She didn’t like that this occurred to her. She didn’t like to think of herself as the sort of person who worried about such things. 

Having reminded herself of the lamp, she couldn’t get out of her head the idea of checking that it was still on. She unfolded an exit triangle of sheet and coverlet. The slick wood floor was cool under her feet. She had thought she wouldn’t need a rug, because there were no downstairs neighbors she needed to worry about disturbing, but she could already tell that in the winter she was going to need one, for insulation. Cold would come straight up from underground.

When she put her eye to the peephole, it took a moment for her sight to adjust to the fish-eye distortion—to the littleness of the nutshell that it screwed her view of the lobby down into. In the picture inside the peephole, the lamp was on. It looked as if there had never been and never could have been any doubt that it was on, as if it had been on for years and years—a quality things sometimes have when you look at them in the middle of the night. They suggest their capacity for going on without you. 

In bed, she found a residual warmth that she crawled back into. She shivered. Just as she was about to drift off, she saw, in half dream, a light going out. The same light? Her eyes popped open. A light somewhere. The idea of it made her feel that she had better check on the lamp again. Again she got out of bed.

In the circular world of the peephole, the bulb was burning steadily.




The next day, she made two new friends.

“Are these our books?” she asked a woman who happened to be standing next to her in a bookstore. She had wandered in only because she had been exploring the neighborhood, but course books were stacked in the aisles, including, there at the back of the second floor, law books, some of which were about torts and contracts. 

“Our books?” the woman echoed. Like Amy, the woman wasn’t quite as young as most of the other people in the store. She also looked as if she might be a fellow Midwesterner and therefore an unguarded person. Less guarded, anyway.

“I’m sorry. Are you a one-L?” Amy asked. Amy was sure the woman had been eyeing the same books.

“You don’t want to be taking home the wrong one of these, do you,” the woman said, fingering a front free endpaper where a price was stamped.

The only information in their phones was about the official bookstore, a few blocks away, on campus.

“Should we just get coffee?” Amy asked.

“Oh, that’s an excellent idea,” the woman said. Her name was Beth.

At the coffee shop, the very same books were piled up on the bar next to a handsome man with a large nose.

“You got them!” Beth said.

“I did!” he replied. “I don’t think we’ve met. But I take it we’re in the same boat?”

“How did you know where to get them?”

“I just went to the bookstore?”

“But which one? We saw them in one that wasn’t the official one.”

“Oh, those guys steal the ISBNs,” the man said. “But people like to buy from them instead, because they’re not as corporate.”

“You don’t care if they’re corporate,” Beth suggested.

“No, I do, or, I mean, I would, but sometimes they’re selling last year’s edition.”

“Are you gay?” Beth asked.

“Am I gay,” he repeated, in the indicative. “I’m sorry to have to disappoint you.”

“I wouldn’t be disappointed.”

“That’s what I mean.”

“You just seem so well informed, for a man in a new city,” Beth explained. “And gays are always so branché.”

“My stepfather is a professor in the engineering school here, actually.”

“Oh, I see,” Beth said.

“So you grew up here?” Amy asked. He was being very polite with Beth, but maybe he would appreciate someone talking with him who wasn’t jousting.

“Sort of, but mostly I grew up in Princeton,” he said.

“With more than one academic parent, then?” Beth guessed.

“Four, if you count stepparents,” he admitted, with the magnanimity that a handsome man usually has about a forced disclosure. “And you?”

“My mother is an accountant, and my father teaches music at a high school,” Beth said. As Amy listened, she realized that she already hoped this man wouldn’t get to know Beth very much better. “In a small town in western Pennsylvania,” Beth continued.

Amy couldn’t bring herself to say anything about coming from Michigan. Maybe it would have felt too much like trying to have beginner’s luck twice. She tried to smile. The man, watching her, seemed willing to wait for her answer but also willing to let her be exempt from giving one.




In bed that night, she realized that George hadn’t called that day. She had told him not to for a while, but his not calling meant that for the first time since they’d met, a day had gone by without their speaking to each other. Did it matter? Maybe it didn’t. Inside the idea that there were things you had to do, things everyone had to go through, was the idea that some days were going to pass without your really living in them. Law school was going to be full of such days, means to an end rather than ends in themselves. The point was just to get to the other side. Maybe the idea of starting over always presupposed the same verdict on the days that had gone before. If you were starting over, after all, you were deciding that those days didn’t count anymore. 

The super had put a blind up over the window, but there was still no blind over the door. There was nowhere to hang one unless you could figure out a way to attach it to the metal track near the ceiling that the accordion grille ran in. Through the diamond spaces in the accordion (in its structure, the grille was actually more like an array of scissors than like an accordion per se), there fell the attenuated, lint-colored, secondhand light that cities have instead of moonlight. At once more constant and less reliable than moonlight. On her desk, mottled by this light, stood the column of books she had gone ahead and bought, at the official bookstore, after she and Beth had left the man in the café, everyone exchanging names and numbers. (His name was Isaac.) And next to the books lay a plastic wallet of highlighters, which she had tried not to buy even though they had been on a rack next to the cash register, because she didn’t quite see the point of them, couldn’t imagine how pulling a color across the words was going to help. But then the cashier had asked, with a look of concern, if she was sure she didn’t want them, and she had given in. Next to the highlighters lay the screwdriver. In the blue light, its yellow handle had a greenish tint.

She sat up. She knew she shouldn’t make a habit of breaking her sleep, but she wanted to take another look at the backyard.

undefined

The non-moonlight had bleached the colors out of the scene—silvered and almost solarized it. The cavity in the cinder block that the tomato plant had emerged from was now completely in shadow, pitch-black. It was surprising that anything had been able to grow in the landscape. The site was a waste, a product of inattention. Of the withdrawal of care. It was chaotic, like anything that has been let go, and the disorder made it harder for one’s mind to take it in, interfered with one’s perception of it. An interfered-with perception was Burke’s definition of the sublime, she remembered from a literature seminar that she had gotten into.

Maybe, since it was a place that resisted being seen, a person would be safe hiding out there. Four of her heartbeats knocked together when she thought this, but she knew better than to take herself seriously. She was just excited; tomorrow was her first class. 

If you wanted to open the accordion grille, there was a metal tab you had to slide up and out of a kind of ward, made of the same metal; the ward was to prevent the tab from being slid up by someone who broke the glass and tried to pry it up from outside. This tab-and-ward mechanism had been painted over, gummed up. She wedged the blade of the screwdriver into one of the seams the paint had conjoined. She picked at the seam with the screwdriver for a while, knocked at it. She needed the parts to separate. If she could hit the pieces apart, if she could hit until the mechanism broke free … The paint was so thick that each time she struck, there was a dull sound like a stick of butter dropped on the floor. The accordion meanwhile creaked, if she happened to lean into it. It was a lot of noise to be making so late. It was the middle of the night. 

What was she doing? 




“Oh my God, they came back,” Beth said, covering her mouth, a few days later. She was reading her phone while she and Amy were waiting for Civil Procedure to start. 

“Who did?” Amy asked.

“That couple. Apparently she didn’t die right away.”

“Who didn’t die?”

“The girl,” Beth explained. A fellow student they didn’t know looked over and then looked away. “She’s why I have a roommate, you know,” Beth continued. Beth didn’t like her roommate, a graduate student in medieval history who refused to put Beth on the lease and had rules about how late Beth could come home and how late she could still be using the kitchen. “That’s another of their crimes.”

“You and I should have been roommates,” Amy said.

“That’s true,” Beth agreed. “I hope she wasn’t still conscious.”

“Wouldn’t she have called for help, if she had been?”

Isaac was in a different section, but all the law students had been assigned lockers, as if they were in high school again, and Isaac’s happened to be near Amy’s, so almost every day they shared a few words. The first day, she had almost been embarrassed remembering the way she and Beth had latched onto him, but he hadn’t made her feel funny about it, and after a few repetitions of the encounter, she had started to look forward to the daily crossing of their paths. It was hard not to. He seemed to be a sunny person. He usually gave her a little hug, and often he asked if she was getting enough sleep, as if, by virtue of their having met a couple of days before classes started, they were friends from before law school, old friends.

“I’ve been meaning to ask you,” he said one day, between her locker and his.

Her phone twitched, and without meaning to, she glanced at it. An “Ugh” escaped her.

“Is everything all right?”

It was an unpaid-bill alert. She and George were still sharing a family account for their cell phones. “I’m getting divorced soon,” she said. “And there are these details.”

“I’m so sorry to hear it,” he said, a little formally, and then, when she half rolled her eyes, added, “or should I be?”

“No, it’s—what were you going to ask?”

“If you and Beth know about the geology library. It has these velour chairs. And cabinets of amber and geodes, which can be very restful if you need an intermission.”

“Thank you,” she said. Another shared piece of his insider knowledge. 

She thought of asking him to show her the geology library, but she had been timing herself. She could read thirty-five pages an hour in her apartment, forty in the law library, and only eighteen in a café. She imagined that she would read even fewer sitting across from Isaac. 

“Beth said something about the art and architecture one,” Amy said.

“Oh, that one’s very nice, too,” Isaac admitted. “It has these alcoves.”

That afternoon, when she opened the heavy door of the geology library, the golden knob of which was set in its center, like a little steering wheel, she sensed the few people in the small room within stir subtly in their chairs and take cognizance of her. Isaac wasn’t among them but she made herself sit down anyway, in a chair that shared a floor lamp with a chair on the other side of it, in which a young woman was reading Evelina. It seemed early in the semester for a novel as long as Evelina; maybe the woman was a grad student reading for her orals. Amy slid Civil Procedure out of the bookstore tote that she had taken to carrying her things in. She felt the young woman’s eyes flick up and register the stodgy brick-red-and-black binding of the textbook. In a room full of strangers keeping silent, it is easy to feel reproached, even if in reality probably no one cares. She needed to be able to make a living. She had to provide for herself. She had become one of the people who can’t take it for granted that they are safe in the world.

 

 

Coming back to her apartment, she noticed that she still had the feeling, left over from her old life, of coming back to someone. She always tried to leave the apartment in good order when she left, so that it would be nice to return to. Maybe that was part of it.

As she opened the second glass door, she heard a neighbor coming downstairs. A heavy step, a man’s. She put on an absent expression, a slight frown, because she didn’t think she had time to be friends with anyone who wasn’t in law school. He was wearing a backpack. When he turned the curve onto the last little flight of stairs, he caught at the hook of the banister to anchor his swivel.

Seeing her startled him. So as not to collide, she had been waiting silently. He nodded and rushed out. 

After dinner she called George to talk about their phones.

“Are you reading about the trial?” he asked. “She’s testifying against him. Apparently they’re one of those couples who aren’t murderers individually but together make a murderer.”

“I don’t really have time.”

“I guess crime isn’t part of law, is it. It’s psychology or sociology. Or its own thing.”

Maybe he wasn’t going to go to law school, in the end. Maybe it had always been her path and not his, and now he was on his way somewhere else. They agreed that she would forward him the alerts for every other month’s phone bill, and he would pay those.

She was considering telling him that she kept getting up in the middle of the night to look out at her backyard, but she wasn’t sure why she wanted to tell him, and then there was a sound like the fall and clatter of a pan on his end of the line.

“Sorry, I’m doing the dishes,” he said.

“Did you get earbuds?” she asked. It used to be that he was unable to hold his cell phone against his ear with just his shoulder, if he was doing anything with his hands.

“No.”

Was someone else there? Someone who was already doing dishes? 

It wasn’t any business of hers. She said good night, and hanging up returned her to the not-quite-silence of her apartment. To the slight tension in the room. Maybe she was getting used to it. Maybe she was starting to let herself be at home in her new life.

A few hours later, in the dark, there was a cry. The sound stopped abruptly, the way the squeak of a shoe suddenly stops. She must have been the one who made it, but it had seemed to come from beside her in the bed. Although it had woken her up, she found that she believed, with a conviction that suggested she was still dreaming, that she had to get up and open the back door to her apartment, because, behind it, she would find a second apartment just like the one she was in. She resisted acting on this belief. Instead she waited for her ordinary beliefs about the world to surface around it and crowd it out. 

Once they had done this, however, she let herself get up and look at the backyard after all. The idea that a person could hide there was almost a kind of company. There wasn’t really anyone out there, of course. If she were ever out there herself for some reason, it occurred to her, she should remember to turn away so the reflection in her eyes wouldn’t make her visible. 




“Amy!” Isaac said, with his rich chuckle, one night when she was studying late in the law library. “I was just heading out,” he added, dropping to a raspy whisper, since it was the library, after all. His manner was even more open than usual, maybe because it was the end of the day.

“I’m done, too,” Amy declared. In fact she still had three pages left of that night’s allotment, but she could finish in her apartment.

“Are you hungry?” he asked as they crossed the university quadrangle together. He was wearing dress shoes that clop-clopped as he walked beside her. The pink flagstones were blown out to white under the floodlights that stared down from the administrative building. “I’m afraid I’m starving. Do you mind if I get something? Maybe just a thing of miso. I can get it to go.”

“We can sit down.”

“No, why don’t we go sit in that little park next to the cathedral? Have you visited the peacocks? What am I saying? Of course you haven’t. We’re in law school.”

“I haven’t done anything,” she admitted. “I look at the empty lot behind my apartment.”

“Beth says you work really hard.”

“Oh,” she said, deprecatingly.

“She works hard, too, I think. I guess we all work hard.”

“She and I walked down to the river together once,” Amy remembered. “That’s the one thing I’ve done.”

At a sushi place on the main avenue, he ordered from the greeter. Even at this hour, much later than Amy liked to eat, there were couples at almost every table. “And maybe a tuna roll,” he told the greeter. “Sure you don’t want anything?” he checked with Amy again, as he took out his credit card. “Maybe a black-and-white cookie?” There was a bakery next door.

 

undefined

 

“You get one,” she told him.

She was out of practice. She had been living by herself for only a month, and she was already a person who resisted being shifted out of her routine.

They found a heavy chain drooped across the gates of the park beside the cathedral.

“I didn’t realize how creepy it is here at night,” Isaac apologized.

“My building has a stoop,” Amy suggested. “It’s only one block over and one block up.”

“Will you go home for the holidays?” Isaac asked, as they walked there. “Where are you from again?”

“Michigan.”

“That’s right,” he said, although in fact she had never told him. He was probably distracted by his hunger, and he was probably also, like her, tired.

“Do you ever have any trouble sleeping?” she asked, which was a little personal, but he was always asking her, and in a way it was a question about study habits.

“Not lately, actually, but I was afraid for a while that I was going to.”

“Oh, look,” she said, as they came to her building. “Someone left another rose.”

“This is where you live?” Isaac asked.

The rose was in the same place as before, laid vertically on one of the squat, sloping walls beside the steps. 

“Who rented this to you?” Isaac asked.

“The university.”

“Are you on the first floor?”

“Yes.”

“Did they at least tell you?”

“Tell me what?”

He was shaking his head. “The girl lived here. The woman.”

Amy looked again at the rose. 

“There were all these news vans,” he continued. “For weeks. Are you all right?”

“I’m fine.”

“Is it okay that I told you? Maybe I shouldn’t have told you. Is there somewhere you could go? Since you didn’t know before, I mean. If you don’t want to go inside.”

“No,” she said. “They said they had repainted,” she remembered.

“New York real estate, man,” Isaac said. “Do you want to come to my place, or do you want me to come inside with you? I’m not saying—”

“I know what you’re not saying. I’ll be fine.”

“I know you’ll be fine.”

She wondered if she should take the flower inside. 

“I’m not sure it isn’t a tort, to be honest,” Isaac said.

“The murder?”

He laughed. “No, I mean, their not telling you. Under the circumstances, it’s not showing the care for a fellow human being that a reasonable person would expect would be shown.”

Even at this moment, she was aware, the clock was ticking. She had those three pages to read still, and he had to eat his late dinner and get to bed. The care they could afford to give to each other had to be measured. The woman who had lived in the apartment before her had died while she, too, had been measuring it, loading her days against the lever of a task the reward for which, in her case, she didn’t live to receive. Maybe any moment you weren’t able to live in for its own sake, Amy considered, was a kind of injustice. A kind no one could dodge completely, of course, but still an injustice. 

“You know, I actually have a few more pages to read,” she said, to excuse herself.




Inside the lobby, she dropped her keys. Evidently she was nervous, even though she didn’t really think she was going to see anything when she unlocked the door. She looked over her shoulder at the fireplace before picking up the keys. She could put the flower out here on the mantel, if she decided to bring it inside the building. She could take one of her drinking glasses and put it in that.

The apartment, once she did open the door and turn on the lights, was unchanged, of course. There was her bed. There was her desk, under the barred window. There were the four burners of the stove. The apartment was so small there wasn’t really anywhere else to put the bed, so it had probably been in the same place. Since the window was mirroring her face, she pulled down the blind. From the outside, all that could be seen through the frosted glass of the unopenable door and the diamonds of the accordion grille was at most her silhouette, and then probably only if she was standing very close to it.

Maybe the yard was where the woman had wanted to go before they came back, where she had imagined she could go.

Amy turned off her lights and tugged up the blind. The fruits of the tomato plant seemed to be pale orange now, though in the uncanny light, color was hard to read. Most of the leaves had withered. No, there was nowhere for a person to hide. Now that her eyes had gotten used to the scene, she could see that clearly.

She drew the blind down and turned the lights on again. At her desk, she opened the law book she still had three pages in, and, against the books she wasn’t reading, she propped up her phone. She chose a Schubert piano sonata. It was on her phone—she didn’t need to stream it—because she had bought it after she and George had driven to Interlochen one summer for a student recital where a childhood friend of his had performed it. The woman had told the audience afterward that her favorite recording of the sonata was Imogen Cooper’s, so that’s what Amy had bought. Before it started, she was afraid it would sound tinny, since she didn’t have a Bluetooth speaker, but because she was sitting so close, it was fine. It was like having a music box. The sonata was in A minor, and at first the melancholy seemed like it was going to be too much, but then it pushed itself into a march.

She wasn’t really reading.

She paused the music and called Beth’s number. “I’m sorry it’s so late,” she apologized.

“I was about to call you,” Beth said. “Isaac texted.”

The sound of Beth’s voice made it okay to be in the room again. “I’m fine,” she said.

“I can’t believe they—” Beth began.

“Beth!” another voice broke in. The medievalist. “Someone’s knocking on the door. Do you know who?”

“I’ll be with you in a moment, Eleanor.”

“Do you know how he got in the building? Did you buzz him in?”

“I’ll tell you in a minute.”

“But who is it? Why won’t you tell me now?”

“I’m so sorry, Amy. May I call you back?”

By the time Beth did call back, Amy didn’t think she wanted to pick up. Which was small of her, she knew. Soon there was a text from Beth saying she and Isaac had been meaning to tell her but hadn’t been sure it wasn’t going to turn out to be nothing, so they had kept putting it off. There were gray dots, and Amy turned her phone over. Which meant she couldn’t put the music back on, if she didn’t want to risk seeing new messages on her home screen.

She wasn’t really mad at them. It was the way the world was. She didn’t seem to be quite in it anymore herself. She would have to try to do the last bit of reading in the morning.

She flossed and brushed her teeth and changed into the underwear and T-shirt she slept in. A few days earlier, fall had at last arrived, after everyone had almost given up on it, and it was so cool at night now that she wasn’t sure the blanket she had brought was going to be warm enough. She took her winter coat out of the wardrobe and placed it folded at the foot of the bed so that if she needed it in the middle of the night she wouldn’t have to get up, she could just pull it over her.

She took a good-night look at the yard. The city glow on the tub, the bricks, and the weeds looked like a dusting of snow. She wondered what she had wanted to get out there for. To plant a garden?

She got in bed, she closed her eyes. She listened to the soft, buzzy trembling of the coils of the refrigerator until, as she knew they would, without being able to say when they would, they stopped trembling. And then at some point she felt the gentle, circumferential pressure of a woman sitting down on the bed beside her. She stayed until Amy fell asleep."

    "text": "He took two days off to go to Auschwitz.

The problem was that he didn’t know what anything was called. Names and names and names—streets, neighborhoods, trains, all made of syllables that passed through him like elements of a dream. Directions were the death of understanding: links at this incoherent set of sounds, rechts at this one, and through all of it his mind whirring with impotence.

Thankfully he had his friend with him, Adam, who knew German. Meanwhile A. was a baby, pointing and wishing for things, but a baby who never learned, never grew.

They took a rideshare with a long-haired Polish man. Afterward A. would remember the rutted roads, the scarred tar across the border, how bumpy it was. His friend sat in the front and talked to the man. A. sat in the back and felt the emotional turbulence of leaving one country for another⁠—leaving one country that was not home for one that was even less like home. So he listened to music. Music was international. It was the language of feeling! He listened to hip-hop that spoke of blowjobs.

It was 2015, and he was a Jew, heading into the ancestral land. He imagined unmown pastures blown by the ghosts of Europe.

The first place they stopped was a gas station where he had to pay to pee. He had euros and the woman who ran the bathroom, seated at a table outside, insisted they pay in zlotys. After he and Adam did a stupid dance of mild begging⁠—“Just euros,” pointing at the coins, that sort of thing⁠—she eventually accepted the currency, which was apparently exchangeable only in the continent’s most prosperous nations. The long-haired Polish man stayed in the car. He was going home.

The man let them out at another gas station, told them to take a bus. He seemed embarrassed to abandon them and didn’t say goodbye. “That guy was an asshole,” Adam said, and A. wondered if he had been an asshole while they were talking in German for two hours or had just become one.

They waited for the bus with some ladies. It was reasonably hot, hot in a way A. could deal with.

Once onboard, they began to panic. Everything was in Polish—one did not expect this; it seemed there should be English somewhere. “Train?” Adam asked the people standing near them. “Train station?” A. felt a perverse satisfaction in Adam being reduced to childish ignorance in the way A. so often was.

Two teenagers offered to help. One held a vape pen. “Follow us, we’re getting off there.” As happens often, one was chubby⁠—the one with the vape⁠—the other thin. They rode in a silence that was awkward only to the non-Poles, to A. and Adam. Should they say something? Make an attempt at small talk? An offer of money? But of course they didn’t have any zlotys yet.




“This town sucks so much,” said the chubby one, laughing and pulling on his vape. After a quarter mile, the group had reached the train station, which, because of repairs, did not exist aboveground. “You have to go under there,” the chubby one said, pointing at a tunnel under the building, paneled with plywood.

At the mouth of the tunnel, A. and Adam became afraid of abandonment and gave their guides a despairing look. Adam offered them five euros, which they declined. “Okay, we come with you,” said the thin one. “Where are you going, anyhow?”

Adam explained that they were going to Oświęcim.

“Fuck that place, I’m never going back there!” said the thin one. “Never!”

At the ticket counter the boys translated Adam’s and A.’s desires into Polish. This time the friends accepted their five euros, in addition to euros for the tickets. “Thank you, good luck!” said the chubby boy, pocketing the denomination, enjoying his vape pen.

Poland was in the EU, but it had its own historic currency, which sounded like a dessert. The zloty. I’ll take two zlotys, please.

Adam and A. sat on the train for an hour and a half, full of wishes⁠—to talk about the boys, the long-haired Polish man; to go over their itinerary⁠—but without any energy to fulfill those wishes. A. tried to read but it occurred to him that the book was the world and he was in it.




The train let them off at a station that was also a mall, at Katowice. A. used his debit card to buy espresso, willing to pay the foreign transaction fee for caffeine. It was roughly eleven in the morning.

They got zlotys from a woman in a window. From another woman in a window they bought their tickets to Oświęcim. “I wish I lived behind a window,” A. said to Adam.

“Can we sit down?” Adam asked, and they hunted for a pair of seats like two seagulls searching for discarded food. At last they sat under a loudspeaker that seemed to be playing two pop songs at once, interspersed with announcements in Polish, then in English. A. felt at home in some minute way.

Adam was tall, or taller than A., which wasn’t difficult. An olive-skinned Floridian who now lived in Berlin, the child of a Domino’s franchiser, Adam translated German into English, the language of commercials and department stores, of worldwide miscommunication.

“How much longer?” A. asked, like Adam was his dad, but it turned out that Adam was taking one of his frighteningly efficient naps: he could sleep for two or three minutes, sitting up, like an intentional narcoleptic.

The train from Katowice to Oświęcim was hot and stuffy, trembling as it wheezed through the countryside. A. read Hannah Arendt and glanced out the window at the shimmer of summer, the limping willows, the electrified fences of railyards. It was toward the end of June: he would stay with Adam for another week before returning to the States, the dark-robed rulers of which had just declared gay marriage to be legal, and where continued social progress seemed so inevitable it had become sort of boring to observe.

He drifted between reading Eichmann in Jerusalem and staring out the window, the caffeine from Katowice leaving an upset stomach like a bruise.

Adam napped, and as A. watched him, he realized that this month with his friend was the most intimate he had been with another person.

When they stepped off the train⁠—not in Florida, not even in Berlin, but in Oświęcim⁠—they faced an advertisement for Kentucky Fried Chicken. Less than one kilometer to the left, it indicated beneath the arrow. Links was the word in German; A. knew this much of the language.

“Links oder rechts?” A. asked. When he spoke the language successfully he had a new feeling, as if he were suddenly on an adventure.

They went to the right, away from Kentucky Fried Chicken and toward the camps.




They checked in at the hotel that A. called in his head Hotel Auschwitz, then he spent twenty minutes shitting.

“Are you okay?” Adam asked when A. emerged from the glassed-in bathroom, which thankfully was opaque.

They ate at Hotel Auschwitz, but not before A. asked at the front desk whether they had a gym, a request treated with polite condescension by the pretty Polish lady working reception.

“This is Auschwitz,” said Adam, “of course they don’t have a gym,” and A. had never felt more American. They ate at a table covered by an umbrella, in a stretch of parking lot the hotel had converted into a dining terrace. Each of the three tables’ umbrellas bore an ad for the official beer of  Poland, which A. ordered. “Enjoy a Żywiec,” read the translation on the ashtray.

“You’re supposed to do what the ad says you’re supposed to do,” A. said.

“I don’t really feel like it,” Adam said, and A. realized that for Adam this place was so solemn that having too much pleasure in its presence would be a kind of desecration, an idea that seemed to A. basically right on the merits. A. planned on enjoying his beer and Gauloises anyway.

“I can’t believe that Auschwitz is right across the street,” A. said when Poland’s national beer materialized.

“Yeah, pretty crazy.” As they listened to the chatter of the table next to theirs, A. felt like they were a couple who, after spending too much time together, were struggling to find a subject yet to be covered. “They’re rich Berliners,” Adam said. “You can tell from their accents.”

Not for the first time since coming to visit Adam in Berlin, A. had the thought that their friendship was some kind of substitute for the romantic companionship they both longed for. It seemed to him that each must be thinking he would rather be here to share this sacred, if not quite romantic, trip with someone he could sleep with.

Instead, it was A. and Adam, like the two boys on the bus.

“What do you think of Poland so far?” A. asked his friend.

“It’s just like in the movies,” Adam said, and realizing belatedly that he had heard a joke, A. felt the pleasure of not completely understanding another person: Adam didn’t find Oświęcim entirely somber after all. This must be the dialogue that relationships consisted of, A. thought, not so much between two people as between ideas and realities, the adjustment of one to the other. Desire was not primarily bodily; it was the longing to come closer.

When their pierogies came, fried though he had asked for his boiled, A. ate only half. I have to stay thin, he thought: If I’m thin, then someone will love me. Though he knew this statement was irrational, its very irrationality gave it power, because it was impossible to disprove. He was young, after all, had experienced no greater pain than mild body dysmorphia, and was capable only of English, the language of advertisements, the language of repetition⁠—the same words said throughout the world. I will have a Żywiec, please: I will have your national beer.




Early⁠—their tour was at nine in the morning⁠—they got into two twin beds perpendicular to each other, but not before A. spent ten minutes in the bathroom of blurred glass; Europe, especially its delicious Gauloises cigarettes, worried his stomach. He and Adam were like a sad Orthodox couple, A. thought, not fucking except on some Sabbath evening that never arrived.

“Are you okay?” Adam asked, reading Martin Buber’s translation of the Bible. “Maybe too many cigarettes?”

“Yes,” A. agreed, “too many Gauloises.”

“You really shouldn’t smoke so much.”

“But I love my Gauloises. The cigarettes suck in America, and it’s romantic here.”

“Okay, well, romance aside, it’s not a good habit.” Adam returned to his Bible, while A. settled in with Arendt.

Eichmann in Jerusalem was famously about the banality of evil, and, according to popular caricature, made the claim that it was hard to hold Nazi functionaries accountable for their crimes because they were “only following orders”⁠—in other words, because many of these crimes consisted of signing papers, sending off documents, and various other bureaucratic tasks, which A. supposed might be the reason state-based fascism had never taken off in the U.S. It required too much paperwork.

“You know, my favorite parts of this book are the ones about how different countries dealt with their Jews,” A. said.

“Remember that she was working from more limited information than we have today,” Adam said.

“Denmark seems like the best, they were good to their Jews. Holland the worst.”

“The Dutch were even worse than the Germans in some ways,” said Adam, who, despite not being Jewish himself, knew significantly more about A.’s people than A. did. “We should go to bed. Big day tomorrow.”

“I might read a few more minutes.”

Adam set down his giant Bible and sighed. “Did you bring your reading lamp?” He pulled a sleep mask over his eyes. “I’m just saying, you’ll want to get good sleep for tomorrow.”

“You mean you want to get good sleep.”

Adam shrugged and turned in the covers. “More or less.” The anality of evil, A. thought as he clipped onto the book the portable reading lamp his mother had bought him from Target.




“At Auschwitz!” A. texted his parents in the morning, once he managed to find strong enough Wi-Fi by waving his phone in the air like a stranded man signaling for help. His parents lived in southwestern Florida, where he hailed from.

“At Auschwitz,” he texted his girlfriend as well. They had hardly texted since he’d been overseas and hadn’t had a phone call once. Though they had virtually nothing in common, sometimes they had fun sex after not seeing each other for weeks or months. He added a kissy face, then left his phone in the room for the day.

The coffee at Auschwitz made him upset. Hotel Auschwitz had instant coffee only⁠—he saw the powder and thought there must be some mistake. He was used to Chemexes, French presses; coffee powder would not do.

“Drink it,” Adam said at the breakfast buffet in the hotel basement, pouring cereal for himself. “It’s all you’re going to get.”

“They have to have brewed coffee somewhere,” A. said, dourly spooning the coffee into his mug.

“I guarantee you they don’t. Remember where you are. You have to drink what they give you.”

“Did you just make a Holocaust joke?” A. asked, pouring hot water, acting astonished.

“It wasn’t a joke,” Adam said and went to sit in a booth. If a relationship is the longing to come closer, the dialogue between idea and reality, it’s also this, A. thought⁠—bickering because one understands the other person too well.

Frustratingly, he enjoyed the instant coffee. It was even indistinguishable from regular drip coffee, in that it tasted the same and guarded against despair by providing him with energy. They went out into the bright blue Oświęcim day and crossed the thoroughfare to the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum, where buses were already unloading groups of confused-looking tourists, many of whom began taking photographs as soon as they got on the ground.

Since being in Berlin, and now in Poland, A. had been thinking about the way the Shoah pushed itself to the limits of one’s imagination, so that any attempt to conjure it necessarily took the form of school projects and unwatchable Oscar-winning movies. Still, A. imagined that at Auschwitz-Birkenau he would have a profound and emotional encounter with the past. He thought about this as they walked toward the museum, which, though called a museum, was just Auschwitz.

Like a couple on their honeymoon might visit the artifacts and landmarks of ancient Rome, he and Adam had, between bouts of sitting in Adam’s apartment and drinking very large beers, gone to a lot of Holocaust places already, like Berlin’s Jewish Museum and the House of the Wannsee Conference near Potsdam, where over lunch Eichmann and Heydrich proposed annihilation through labor as the Final Solution to the problem of the Jewish people. But they had not yet been to a camp. This was the real deal.

Yet what he dealt with primarily upon entering the museum was the confusing process of putting on and tuning the pocket radio that would allow him to hear their tour guide.

“Do you understand how to use this?” A. asked his friend.

“Yes, it’s pretty easy.”

“Maybe for you!”

“I can only comment on my own experience,” Adam responded philosophically.

It was bizarre⁠—this tiny box A. could hardly fit into the pocket of his black skinny jeans, the grainy sound as he tried to dial in to the tour guide’s frequency, and the whole time surrounded by tourists, each speaking in their incompatible tongues, Spanish, Chinese, German, Hebrew, rushing to start their linguistically specific tours.

It was so sunny that he felt uncomfortable; it really should have been gray. As they approached the world-famous ARBEIT MACHT FREI gate with a lush carpet of grass around it, A. removed his headset and said to Adam, “Not true, as it turns out.”

“What’s that?” Adam asked, taking off his own headset.

“I said, ‘Not true, it turns out.’ Work doesn’t make you free.”

Adam laughed, said, “Let’s listen to the guide,” and placed his headset back on.

As they went through the gate, A. almost fell on a stone slab.

“Careful,” he heard Adam say through the cushion of his headset, where the Polish tour guide was telling them in the language of advertisements about how Auschwitz was made.




“They came from Greece and France, Holland, Slovakia, Hungary, Berlin and Vienna, Oslo, even Rome after Italy withdrew from the war and was under occupation,” the guide said. “Many are surprised to learn that Fascist Italy insisted on keeping their Jews. This is all in your history books. I have had visitors argue with me that this is untrue. Look it up.”

A. watched a towheaded father and two blond teens listen to their headphones intently, and wondered if everyone on the English-language tour was a gentile.

“Here in the main camp, as opposed to Birkenau, where we will go later on, the gas chambers were set up initially for Soviet prisoners of war. These gas chambers were rudimentary compared to the later ones with the crematoria, which became necessary for greater speed in killing once the Germans began deporting greater numbers of Jews east. ‘How do we make more corpses more quickly?’ This was the perverse question the SS set out to answer. No doubt it sounds surreal to you, but the SS approached this as a manufacturer would approach their production line. Killing civilians based on ethnic and racial identity had become a positive good, as in your countries today you might view ‘job creation’ or ‘growth.’ ”

Did anyone else feel chided by her language? A. watched an unshaven man on the tour⁠—British?⁠—scratch his chin. Well, they did deserve some chiding, he supposed.

“When Birkenau became the end place for most inmates, where they would either work or die, the SS judged it more ‘efficient’ to centralize there both the gas chambers and crematoria. What’s that?” she answered a stout lady at the front of the group with her hand raised⁠—A. felt a warm swell of recognition at her dyed-red hair, which reminded him of his aunt in Miami. “Yes, it’s about two kilometers from where we are now.”

“And what is it in miles?” asked the lady.

He could remember the two or three Jewish girls in elementary school who were obsessed with the Holocaust. In sixth grade, one girl wrote a short story about a victim who narrated her own death from heaven, and he recalled finding it idiotic and schlocky even then, as an eleven-year-old. That was asshole-ish of me, he thought as they entered one of the old brick barracks, but still, the story was terrible. He remembered feeling jealous when everyone praised it.

“Auschwitz became the main camp in 1943,” the tour guide continued, “when the Germans judged that the other death camps, like Treblinka, had fulfilled their missions.” They passed the barracks where an SS doctor would point either left or right, links oder rechts, to the gas chambers or to a kind of living that coincided with dying.

“Take the case of Olga Lengyel,” the guide was now saying, “who wanted to protect her son from hard labor. She told the SS doctor her boy was under twelve, thinking this would save him, but he was sent to the gas chamber because of that. After the war, she asked, ‘How could I have known?’ Such things happened regularly.”

“That would’ve been my mom,” A. said to Adam, who either didn’t hear or was ignoring him.

The red-haired woman had heard and now approached. Was she truly Jewish? He found himself attempting to detect ethnic characteristics in a manner that the operators of this camp had arguably perfected.

“It’s not funny,” she said. Her husband, gaunt and bronzed, cupped her elbow, as if to pull her away.

“It’s not funny at all,” the husband added, a man in a faded Marlins tee, his carriage as gentlemanly as it was threatening. It was as if his aunt and uncle, the latter of whom was raised Methodist and as a convert had become more observant than anyone in the family, had flown to Europe to chastise him.

Adam noticed what was going on, and without breaking stride, he turned his head and asked A., “Can we move away from these people?” The couple, however, marched ahead, back into position behind the guide.

“That’s correct. Before they began deporting Jews east to Auschwitz, here seventy thousand or so Poles were shot, or worked into their grave as slaves,” she said in response to a question from the blond patriarch A. had seen earlier, his offspring grouped behind him as if he were their personal tour guide. A. wondered where their mother was and felt sad. “Then it was a labor camp,” she went on. “Please watch your step.”

They saw the famous hair, the piles of it behind glass, shorn from the skulls of inmates; the cans of Zyklon B, the chemical used to kill them. A. made himself take in the scale of the cans and the brown and gray shades of the hair. Then they entered the gas chamber.

It felt oddly cozy, like a wine cellar, and when they emerged into the day, it was brighter than ever, the sky panoptic and broad, disturbingly gorgeous. A group of Israelis walked by wrapped in blue-and-white flags.

“Who are the flags for?” A. asked Adam. “Who are they showing off to? The ghosts?” Adam shrugged, lifting off his headset. “Maybe the Europeans.”

Before the bus came to take them to Birkenau, the guide encouraged everyone to get lunch on the grounds of the museum. Finding it interesting that they served ice cream at Auschwitz, A. bought a creamy popsicle from the snack bar, and at the gift shop, a copy of Primo Levi’s two Holocaust memoirs, If This Is a Man and The Truce. A. liked the title If This Is a Man. This must be what women think when they see me, he laughed to himself, at himself, knowing the ice cream would make him feel fat.




Birkenau was even greener.

As they walked around the outskirts, the tour guide told them about bunkers one and two, which to A. looked like they might easily be dropped down in his country to serve as rustic bed-and-breakfasts. “These old farmhouses, one red, the other white, they converted into death chambers. At first, a Special Commando made up of select inmates would pile the corpses into a mass grave and burn them.”

As the tour guide described this process⁠—there were no headsets now, because Birkenau was less crowded⁠—it occurred to A. that he had heard all this before. How to reach beneath what one knew and didn’t know and brush against⁠—what? Reality, he supposed.




He power walked around Birkenau, hoping to burn off the popsicle before dinner.

This part of the camp was undeniably pretty. He admired the overgrown field, the gravel path around it covered by oaks and larches, the expanse of barracks and the wide expanse of the sky, the expanse of the self sandwiched between the two.

Now and then he heard another tour circling by, speaking German.

“Wie hast du das gefunden?” A. asked Adam in that language. How did you find it? meaning the museum. They were leaving, the tour was over. At the end, they had walked the selections ramp and entered a building. There he’d seen an installation with hundreds of photographs of the men and women and children who, having moved across the continent, had gathered in Birkenau to rise up as smoke.

Adam replied in a German he could not follow, but A. understood he was being corrected. “Ja, natürlich,” he said.

“Nein, sagt man das nicht in diesem Fall,” Adam said⁠—No, one does not say that in this case. “Anyway, let’s not speak German here.”

They walked to Oświęcim in their summer clothes. Adam suggested that they take a shortcut, which was vaguely picturesque in that it was not next to a highway. Because Adam had an EU phone plan, A. relied on him for directions, which deepened the feeling that he was Adam’s son.

After some time they saw a burning object. It seemed like a rag and lay on the dirt road, simply burning, gray smoke ascending. They walked around it, and when they got to Oświęcim, they alerted two young policemen hanging out in front of a building.

“Hi there. There’s something burning back that way, maybe a quarter kilometer. You can see the smoke,” Adam said. Being that he was olive-toned and dark-haired, they might have imagined he was Turkish, and so eyed him skeptically: perhaps he had started the fire he was telling them of.

“Okay,” said one of the men, who was blond. He set his cigarette down gently on the roof of the cop car. “We check it out later.” Then they went back to talking.

Oświęcim was not green. It was a regular depressed town, full of nondescript houses and, it seemed, minimal restaurants, excluding Kentucky Fried Chicken. Suddenly A. missed Berlin, which felt very American in terms of the quantity of restaurants. Those restaurants even made up for their lack of quality with comic names like Burgermeister, or the Sixties, a diner styled after the American fifties that obviously, he supposed, could not be named after that decade because of the German postwar experience. But they were not in Berlin, they were in Oświęcim, and they were starving, a feeling that pleased A., because it meant he had burned off the popsicle. He thought of the burning rag. Was it still burning?

They found a massive Italian spot, three stories, with a generously sized terrace. He excused himself to go pee and, on his way down to the basement level of the restaurant, missed the last step and fell onto the landing.

He got up dizzy and in pain, hot flashes and nausea rushing through his body as his ankle throbbed. He went in and peed anyway, then dragged his twisted ankle to the garden level. When the waiter came, he ordered a liter of beer⁠—Żywiec, natürlich⁠—and with the excitement of a spouse who has a new story, finally something fresh to talk about with his partner, prepared to speak of the fall.

“I fell down the stairs. Or, I fell down one stair.”

“I was wondering what happened. Are you okay?”

“Nothing a Żywiec won’t help. Żywiec, the drink of the injured!” A. had the thought that he wasn’t looking for romantic love so much as just to be watched over and cared for⁠—that his longing for closeness was really a cry to be held. “My ankle does hurt, though.”

“You’re probably tired. It was a heavy day,” Adam said.

“Plus pretty much all I ate was that popsicle,” A. said proudly.

He studied the terrace around them, the satisfied diners, the officious servers in white and black like pretend Italians. Maybe the longing he felt was the longing one felt for God. To reach toward the divine not for pious reasons but for the solace of not being stranded inside yourself for the rest of your life.

After paying, they returned to Hotel Auschwitz, taking the highway route so they wouldn’t have to check whether the strange, isolated rag was still on fire.




The next day, A. got angry again about coffee.

Walking the highway one last time, rolling their suitcases on the sidewalk, he imagined the pleasure of a café inside the Oświęcim station, a man with a peaked cap, who, in serving him espresso that he would consume on the train as he read Primo Levi’s Holocaust memoirs, would combine the romance of intra-European travel with American-style convenience. But everything was closed. There was an excessive, almost luxuriant number of print shops and pharmacies but nothing resembling a place that, if it were open, which it was not, would serve him espresso.

“I can’t believe this,” he said to Adam. “Fuck Oświęcim.” I am never going back there, fuck that place.

Adam shook his head. “I’m willing to bet they have a machine in the station.”

They did. A. inserted enough zlotys that the robot barista made for him a Milchkaffee that, like the powder from Hotel Auschwitz, surprised him with its effectiveness. Because he was embarrassed by his ur-American behavior of expecting his needs to be met the moment they emerged, he allowed an understanding of his naivete to approach conscious thought. I’m like one of the tourists who wants to take photographs they’re not allowed to take. I want to drink coffee Oświęcim can’t give me, but what there is is good.

As they waited for the train, Adam napped. When their transport arrived, it was modern and sleek and moved softly through the morning, passing wildflowers and nameless trees, leaves golden in the light that slanted through mist.

A. could feel even now that in acknowledging his naivete it was starting to transform into something more complex and painful, a form of self-knowledge, insight into the parts of himself he could change, like his whiny standards, and those he never could.

As he flipped through Primo Levi, he learned that the writer was twenty-five when the Reds liberated Auschwitz⁠—that is, liberated him.




In Kraków they shared a bed.

“Did we know about this when we booked?” A. asked as they stared down at the mattress, avoiding the placing of blame because he didn’t want to receive any.

“It was supposed to be two twins,” Adam said. “Oh well, I booked the whole trip and only one thing’s gone wrong. Not a bad average.”

“Our rideshare did drop us off in a town we still don’t know the name of with no information on how to get where we were going.”

Adam laughed; he seemed happy to be beyond Oświęcim. “Nothing we can do now. It won’t kill us.” He went into the hallway to shower and A. stared with vacant horror. The bed was clad in polka-dot sheets that, were they to come alive, would have said, “We’re for college couples touring Europe who will soon break up!” Here was a substitute bed, just as their friendship in Europe was a substitute love.

They walked toward the Jewish Quarter, and as A. wondered why his friend was so into Holocaust history, he recognized that he couldn’t ask. It felt sometimes that they were a middle-aged married couple, speaking easily of those things that each already knew about the other but never inquiring about all that remained unexplored; this was their relationship, which A. had seen exhibited by his parents.

Yet if he had to guess, he thought as they stepped on shiny slick cobblestones past tourists dining under canopies, he would assume that Adam’s interest in the history of Europe’s dead Jews came down to his ambivalent relationship with Germany, the society into which he had fully assimilated. Adam spoke German fluently, better even than many Germans, and understood the bureaucracy from his frequent, and so far successful, attempts to convince the Germans to allow him to remain in their country.

At the same time, A. believed, Adam loathed the Germans: their culture of Holocaust remembrance, which helped them distract themselves from their present problems, like the debt crisis in Greece, and the joy they found in officialdom, in punishing people who misunderstood the rules, usually foreigners. A. imagined that it was for these reasons that Adam was interested in the history of Europe’s Jewry, because it brought him up against the place he liked enough to make a life there, while also giving shape to his hatred of it.

For A.’s part, his interest was easier to comprehend. His family were German Jews, and coming to Berlin gave him a sense of brushing against the past. Still deeper, there was the feeling of penetrating a mystery.

They went on a two-hour-long guided tour of Jewish Kraków. They passed plots of synagogues that had been torn down and replaced with stuccoed apartments; the building where a Jewish gymnasium once existed and that was now a soccer club. As they stood in front of the old Jewish bathhouse, A. remembered a book he’d found at his parents’ house the previous summer, The Jewish Way in Love and Marriage, written by a rabbi. In this guide, which included, thankfully, a lengthy section on fucking, the rabbi described the difference between sex as an expression of raw animal pleasure, “a coming,” and as chibbur, “a joining.” A. recalled, because the image remained in his brain like the memory of some recurrent dream, that the concept of chibbur was based on a mystical vision of two cherubim turning toward each other. The rabbi wrote that chibbur referred to the knowledge of one’s partner “from the inside,” a journey beyond the walls of fantasy and selfishness, narcissism and self-loathing, within which one has spent life exiled, or, rather, that last element was A.’s interpretation, based on his own experience so far.

While it might be sacrilegious, A. thought, to propose that he was seeking a kind of mystical, quasi-erotic union in his encounters with Auschwitz and, now, the old Jewish Quarter, it was also true. He sensed he wasn’t that different from the girl in middle school writing from the point of view of a dead Jew. He had the theories and poetic phrases he’d been fed in college, she’d had the treacle of Hebrew school. In both instances these clichés were the only way one had of accessing reality; they were like inconvenient train transfers, diversions one took to reach the aimed-for place.

After the tour, at the company’s gift shop, he bought a gender-neutral Contemporary Torah. If this is a man, he thought, as he exchanged an ungodly number of zlotys for it.

Adam shat in the tour company’s gift shop⁠—“I’ll use the restroom,” he’d said, which was their mutual code⁠—while A. read through some of Genesis. “It is not good a person should be alone,” God judged in 2:18, and so He had made someone for Adam to live with. He made A.

“We have to get pierogies,” he said when his friend emerged, wearing a windowpane blazer.

“Yes, it’s pierogi time,” Adam said solemnly, and they went to find the authentic joint that A.’s Polish friend had recommended.

A. led them through the night; whatever the international roaming charges might be, he wanted to be the man this time. He texted that he was in Kraków to the woman he was dating and who was dating him because neither one of them wished to be alone.

A. sat with Adam in the restaurant’s basement, next to a brick fireplace and many tokens of Polishness, such as vests and pointed helmets.

He took a photo of Adam, then thought about posting it on Instagram, the app A.’s generation was beginning to use to suppress their underlying sense of sorrow by highlighting their moments of joy.

“You look handsome,” A. said, trying to show the photo to his friend. “Should I post it?”

But Adam was focused on his pierogies. “I don’t give a shit,” he said, smiling. “These are delicious.” Studying the photo he’d taken of his friend, A. thought Adam looked glad to be here with him, even in this restaurant trafficking in gleeful stereotypes of its own culture. Why else would he let A. stay in Berlin for a month rent-free and have planned an educational vacation? While A. imagined some undefined lover, Adam might have been grateful for his simple presence.

Was that the truth, though? His understanding of what his friend felt kept shifting. Shouldn’t he have been able to ask? But English didn’t seem built for this.

“Let’s try to get a nightcap,” A. suggested after dinner, so they wandered around town squares and streets that were swarming with attractive men and women. They saw hardly anyone drinking, not even smoking; the others were just in transit from one thumping building to another.

They failed to find a nightcap; it was all now a nightclub.

When they returned to the Airbnb, they climbed into bed, both with their shirts on, facing opposite walls. A. read while Adam stretched out in his sleep mask.

“Looking forward to being back in Berlin?” A. asked.

Adam yawned. “I’ll be glad to be back in a country where I know the language. I wish I’d learned a little Polish before coming.”

“How do you think I feel in Germany?” A. asked.

“We’ll spend your last week working on language skills,” Adam replied. “You have to widen your vocabulary.”

“Do you know how one says ‘never’ in camp slang?” Levi asks the reader. “ ‘Morgen früh,’ tomorrow morning. It is now the hour of ‘links, links, links, und links,’ the hour in which one must not lose step.”

Ausstieg links, ausstieg rechts, A. thought, remembering the aboveground train in Berlin: Exit left, exit right. He understood these words, how to be told how to leave, where to go.




Their last day in Poland, they decided to see another camp.

“One more camp for the road,” A. said. They sat under a striped umbrella, drinking real espressos, which A. found to his grave disappointment were not as strong as the instant and automatic coffees of Oświęcim.

“I don’t know why you keep making jokes about it,” Adam said. He seemed especially somber today, as if expending the rest of this mood on their last camp.

“You’ve been in Berlin too long. What was the Wittgenstein line? That which we can’t speak of, we have to pass over in laughter.”

“That’s ridiculous. Of course we can speak of it. We had a three-hour-long tour about it. You’re never going to experience being here if you defend against it with comedy.”

“It’s a way of expressing love and respect,” A. tried to argue. “Like you’d make fun of someone you’re attracted to.”

“These aren’t people you’re attracted to. They’re concentration camps. Anyway, are you ready?”

It was raining again, and Adam wore a trench coat, while A. wore a navy raincoat marketed in America’s language of advertising as “water-resistant,” which meant that it was utterly vulnerable to water but looked like it wasn’t.

They took the tram and then a bus to the outskirts of Kraków, where they walked along a highway. “It can’t be here,” Adam said, “there’s no way.” Across the road stood a Castorama, which A. understood to be something like the Polish Home Depot.

“There’s this old episode of Beavis and Butt-Head I remember,” A. said as they trooped along, “where they decide to walk to Las Vegas. That’s kind of what this feels like.”

“They could mark it a bit better, I agree.”

They walked back and forth searching for the graveyard, which according to the internet was very small. Finally they encountered a couple wearing ugly clothes and hiking backpacks, the upper-middle-class German uniform of choice for summer trips. Adam spoke to the two of them for what felt like a long time. “Links, immer links,” they kept saying, so Adam and A. walked out of this part of the forest and turned left, but this took them back to the camp’s entrance.

“Idiots,” Adam said. “There truly is no one stupider than bourgeois German couples.” They returned to the point where they had encountered the idiots and kept walking in that direction, until they found the cemetery. There was only one grave with any discernible markings, for a guy named Chaim.

They found the ruins of the work camp, several stone barracks covered in graffiti and half-destroyed, presumably by firebombing. A group of Kraków residents were having a picnic there. “Shameful,” Adam said. As they toured the mildewed structures, the Poles packed up their lunch and got into a station wagon.

The two friends emerged from the ruins and the station wagon’s windows rolled down. The picnicker in the passenger seat shouted, “They only worked here!”

“That doesn’t mean you have to have a fucking barbecue,” Adam yelled, and as the station wagon drove away another picnicker frowned at Adam, more in regret than menace, though there was some menace mixed in.

A. felt impressed with his friend’s willingness to confront these strangers in a country where neither of them knew the customs.

“You handled that well,” A. said. Adam shrugged and they went on. The lack of pride was even more impressive. It was almost a defiling of one’s idea of the other, a type of destruction. They returned to the city mostly in silence, both needing to pee. It started to rain, and then the rain weakened and stopped, leaving a sky the color of bone.

Condensation began to ascend and they waited outside an apartment for their ride back to Berlin, who turned out to be a musician. As A. got into the Volvo, remembering the Volvo a friend’s mother would drive them in to Hebrew school, he found he was excited to return to Germany. He even missed that country of withdrawn neurotics who gave incorrect directions.

A. looked at the driver’s violin case buckled between him and Adam, and remembered something else he’d read in his parents’ book on Jewish marriage, about how God acted as a “third” in consecrated marriages. If the marriage were not consecrated, however, the relationship would be like fire consuming fire. God was a wall between two burning things.

Near the German border, A. glanced at Adam, who was looking out the other window, then bent across the violin case and asked, “Don’t you feel like this trip was weirdly very intimate?”

Now that he’d asked the question, he could hear how untrue it was to their way of talking. Adam turned to him slowly, shrugged, and said, “Sure, I guess. You want to get food when we’re back?”

“Yeah, how about kebap?” A. answered, and Adam nodded. As they returned to their respective windows, he imagined meeting someone to whom he would ask such a question normally, who would even ask him such a question⁠—“Don’t you feel like this trip was weirdly very intimate?”⁠—and then what would he say?

Closer to Berlin, they encountered traffic, and the drivers all stopped. Families got out and stretched; some children pissed, and others tossed soccer balls. After half an hour, traffic eased and the children and adults rushed back into their cars, where they again became anonymous.

    "text": "We have nothing to do with what’s happening. Under the heavy downpour the dirt can no longer evade its destiny of becoming mud. The surface of the soil shimmers as the rain kicks up brown droplets that are spit out in all directions each time the tires inch toward the side of the road, making way for other cars to pass. Some of these droplets splat on the windshield, flecking small ovoid splotches onto the glass that last only until the windshield wipers swish over and remove most of them. But the wipers aren’t able to erase the condensation left on the inside of the glass by the breath of two passengers, which has turned the besieged, muddy plots of land on either side of the road, the saturated fields and plains, the dark green hills and their wet trees, into a colorful blur made ever more obscure by the pouring rain.

It is very cold outside, though less so inside the car, it seems, with the kufiyya lying across the dashboard, forming a coiled snake ready to strike. From time to time, the driver’s hand extends to pick it up and wipe the inside of the window as far as it can reach. A small part of the windshield remains shrouded in mist, which has slithered its way in front of the one in the passenger seat, whose eyes chase the confused horizon line beyond the fields and plains and hills as they dissolve into one another.

Indifferent to the passenger’s gaze, these fields and plains and hills thirst for this flood of rain, after a dry spell that’s lasted since the previous winter, except for one or two rainstorms in the spring and another in midautumn. Nobody knows for certain why the rain stops, and the lack of it often stirs up their anxiety. The earth is depleted, its surface cracked, its soil hardened, having offered all the moisture it contained over the year to the wide variety of trees and plants that grow upon it. It is mostly almond and olive trees that blanket the plains and hills. After their winter slumber, the brown almond branches onto which rain now falls begin to sprout thin dark green leaves, following flowers that start out pink and quickly turn white, until a powerful wind gusts through, tears the petals from the calyxes to which they cling, and twirls them down to the ground, concealing the earth directly beneath the tree with pale whiteness. On the tree, inside the calyxes from which the white petals have just fallen, there appear small, velvety, slightly purple drupes that gradually turn green as they grow to the size of small stones that could be thrown to keep a certain kind of harm at bay. At the start of summer, the exterior husks begin to turn yellow, become brittle, and split open, revealing almond shells. As summer proceeds and it gets warmer, the almonds are ready to fall on their own, which can happen faster if the branches are shaken. The leaves also begin to dry out and flutter, some falling to the ground before an autumnal breeze comes along and sweeps them all away, leaving behind lonesome branches. This is the typical cycle of the almond tree. In comparison, olive trees go through all four seasons with hardly any noticeable changes. They don’t shed their leaves, which continue to color the scrubby hills a green closer to blue all year round. Among these leaves, hardly discernible, are the green olives that grow slowly over the course of months, some turning black by the end of fall, most remaining hidden. Sometimes the arid orchards are pockmarked with holes where trees have been uprooted.

Across the plains that are now all muddy and brown, what is grown can change from year to year, decade to decade, or century to century, to allow the soil some rest from a particular type of plant that has depleted its resources, or due to the situation that has been deteriorating day after day, often accompanied by changes in landownership. With the arrival of spring, different shapes and different shades of greenery start to appear, some lasting until summer, from the soft green of undulating wheat to the irrepressible dark green of bean plants with folds that harbor small white blossoms, or the scandalous yellow discs of sunflowers floating above thin legs of a fading green, even the crisp green of the little cotton plant leaves, perforated by the pale yellow of tiny flowers, which lasts only a day or two before turning darker, and the next day red, then purple, until the petals become desiccated and fall and around two months later are replaced by the familiar fluffy white of cotton, bunched around brown stems turned brittle once summer comes to an end. This is the range of colors that dominates the fields for months on end, only sometimes infiltrated by different shades or shapes that might belong to a perennial tree, an oak or a carob, or to a plant that might have been cultivated right there the year before and begun to grow back although nobody sowed it, or to the wild plants that line the boundaries of those fields. By fall, after the harvesting is done and the plants have been stripped, the plains turn yellow, covered in stubble, before the plots are tilled into tiny hard mounds of earth with dry, exposed roots, and rain comes down, as it does now, dislodging the roots and dissolving the soil.

Suddenly the driver says something to the passenger beside him that she cannot hear. She turns away from the blurred outside, and the clarity with which she sees him sends a momentary flash of terror across her eyes. She asks him to repeat what he just said. He says she needs to bring down the kufiyya. She asks him again, only now in a tone laced with confusion, about what he has said. The driver tells her again to bring down the kufiyya. It is difficult for her to understand what is being requested, so she asks him why. He asks her again, now with brevity and irritation, to bring down the kufiyya, and that’s that. But why?

This brevity is what she hates most about him, a brevity that might at any moment explode into a rage so unbridled it threatens to take possession of her. And so she asks once more, this time defiantly, why. He replies in a calm voice laced with simmering anger that there is a flying checkpoint on the road ahead. She looks in every direction through the glass windows. Nothing but swirling blobs of brown, gray, and green. He must be wrong. She asks him where the checkpoint is exactly. Through teeth that are chattering, though not from cold, he tells her it’s in the middle of the road directly ahead of them. In that moment her eyes might have been able to glimpse something green hovering over a broad black line that could be the road. But the request is still incomprehensible, and she wants to understand it first. So she again asks why. The chattering of the driver’s teeth becomes ever more pronounced before he angrily shouts at her to just bring down the kufiyya, and that’s that! The car continues on its journey, undeterred by what is going on inside it, until the colorful blur gives way to a few soldiers standing in the middle of the road, where they have set up a flying checkpoint. One of them gives the driver a signal to slow down and bring the car to a stop. She finally rushes to do what she had been asked and grabs the kufiyya from the dash‑board and shoves it under the driver’s seat as he mutters through pursed lips that she doesn’t need to do that, asking her now to just leave the kufiyya where it is. The soldiers put an end to this argument, one of them making a signal to indicate that the driver must roll down his window, with which he complies. The soldier says something that makes the driver’s face look as though he has swallowed any intent to groan, when his torso turns slightly to the right and he gets his wallet out of his back pocket. He opens it and removes his ID, then leans to the side, opens the glove compartment, and pulls out a plastic sleeve that contains some folded papers, which he takes out and hands to the soldier. After a brief inspection, the soldier says something else and then walks away with the other soldiers. They all stand there together, examining the documents and the ID, talking indolently with one another and with others over their walkie-talkies under the rain as it thins to a drizzle.

Silence envelops the two passengers left sitting in the car as the cold air streaming in through the open window begins to erase, bit by bit, the warm traces of breath on the right side of the windshield. One of the soldiers returns with the documents and the driver starts up the engine, but the soldier abruptly waves the wet papers up and down like a ragged fan. The driver switches the engine back off. The soldier asks him to step out of the car and come with him. Standing to the right side of the road, they go on posing questions, to which the driver responds with brevity. She remains in her seat inside the car, surveying their shapes, which have become very clear, and a few scattered words that she doesn’t understand reach her ears. This is just one of the many downsides of the age gap between her and her brother; she hasn’t started learning Hebrew yet.

The driver comes back inside the car to find his little sister shivering with cold. He closes the window and drives toward the gloomy sky, where colliding clouds have swallowed up all remaining whiteness to become an effervescent gray, presaging more rain. And so it starts to rain again, although the two passengers probably did not notice when it stopped earlier, consumed as they were by their encounter with the soldiers. Only the earth is aware of this, having become completely slaked and now incapable of absorbing any more of the raindrops that continue to fall, increasing the roar of the floods that cascade over the hills and the boulders, the cars and the rooftops and the streets, gushing toward the muddy morass. The car turns onto a narrow side road, alone in the sluicing downpour, as it continues upward into the clouds bunched on the horizon. From there the narrow road guides the car through the lowering clouds that gradually reveal abandoned streets lined with simple houses, their doors and windows tightly shut, their damp gray walls covered with phrases scrawled in green and red and black, hastily written in slanted letters that seem to be fleeing from the words they spell, but without depriving the script of its beauty. Down with the Occupation. Dignified Free Palestine. Uprising Forever. Revolution Until Victory. Freedom for the Prisoners of Freedom. The Black … all of a sudden a group of masked young men bursts out from between the houses, carrying stones and sticks, and heads toward the car. Her brother immediately stops the car and ducks as the first stone crashes onto the roof, while she remains in her seat, following with her eyes what is happening all around, her face contorted in astonishment. Her brother grabs something from under the seat as one stick smashes into the trunk, then another, and he leaps out, waving the kufiyya at the young men, who freeze right where they stand, their hands clutching stones and sticks suspended in midair. Then they disappear. In the blink of an eye the walls of the houses and the clouds swallow them back up. Total stillness.

Her brother rushes to inspect the dents and scratches left by the stones and sticks. She settles back into contemplating the walls that swallowed the young men whole. No trace of them remains. There are only the inscribed phrases. She continues reading. The Black Panther. The Red Eagle. The latter is obscured slightly by an almond tree with thick gray branches that end in thin, brown, dripping stems, the dangling droplets falling at irregular intervals, growing denser as a flock of birds alights on it. The birds are hesitantly coming back into view now that the rain has completely stopped, some flying over the small square or landing in small puddles made by rainfall. They plunge in their beaks or wings, bathe, and then return to the branches of the almond tree to join the other birds. She is still observing the agitated movements of the birds when something falls from the tree, what appears to be a big brown almond that has landed next to some young green grass growing around the trunk. Her eyes cling to this almond. Despite the distance, it soon becomes clear that it has an uncommon smoothness to it and appears to have moved ever so slightly. After prolonged staring, it begins to look more green than brown, or rather like it’s molting from brown to green. And with further squinting, this little almond might seem to sprout a tail. Her brother finishes circling around the car and opens the driver’s door, tosses the kufiyya onto the dashboard, and gets inside. And she freezes in her seat when the chameleon that has settled near the wild grass around the tree trunk slowly turns its head, stares right at her, and blinks.

    "text": "A college friend of my father’s picked me up at the airport. It was my first time ever riding in a convertible and although Anne⁠—that was her name⁠—kept the top up, it still felt like an important milestone for me. I’d never met Anne before but I knew she was a lesbian. I knew Anne and her ex-wife, now estranged, had been among the first gay couples in the U.S. ever allowed to have their own baby, using fertility. Also, I knew Anne to be extremely affluent. 

In transit all these facts became somehow conflated, so by the time we finally reached the Castro, I genuinely believed Anne had gotten rich off being gay alone. This seemed possible. Hers was the same house she’d rented when she arrived in the city, then bought cheap a decade later after her landlord died from AIDS. 

“Technically,” Anne said, stopping at a red light on a steep hill, “it was complications.” Her short haircut made her look like a male pilot. She rested her hand on the hand brake between us, holding it loosely and tapping her thumb against the button on the tip. 

“This launches the missiles,” Anne said, looking at me looking at her hand. “Pew pew. Pew pew.” When the light changed, the small car ahead of us shuddered backward, then lurched up and away. Expertly, Anne accelerated through the crest of the hill before signaling to pull left into a driveway, where she parked behind a charging hybrid.




The house was huge and it was orange. It had recently been granted an important historical status. 

“We’re so honored, obviously,” Anne’s fiancée told me halfway through something she kept calling the grand tour. “Obviously, it’s such an honor. But between you and me”⁠—and here, she lowered her voice⁠—“it’s making this kitchen reno way harder than it has to be.” 

Anne’s fiancée was younger than Anne but much taller. She reminded me of a teacher who is also a coach⁠—not a specific person, I mean like an archetype. As it happened, Anne’s fiancée really did play basketball; she’d made varsity as a freshman. When she said that, I knew she meant college freshman, both because she was an adult and also because, in my experience, adults who went to college liked to talk about it all the time, even decades after the fact, even if they never graduated. Best years of your life! My dad was always saying stuff like that. But if that was true I thought it must mean less about college than whatever happened after. 

“Varsity basketball,” Anne’s fiancée mused as we climbed the stairs to the part of the house that had at one time been the servants’ quarters. “I mean, can you believe I didn’t know?” She turned to wink at me, adding, almost apologetically, “Of course, it was a different time.” I felt unsure as to whether she meant about being gay or having servants, so I just winked back. Or, I closed both eyes and turned my head sharply to the side to give the impression of having winked.

In the attic, we stood together in front of a small circular window Anne’s fiancée called an oeil-de-boeuf. I listened while she described the location of various San Francisco landmarks relative to the view from the oeil-de-boeuf.

“And the Bay Bridge …” she said, trailing off as she turned to point at the blank wall opposite the oeil-de-boeuf, “is right there. You’ll see that tomorrow.” And then we went back downstairs.

There was a water feature in the backyard with one massive koi fish named Clever Girl and a tiny house that had been Anne’s daughter’s playroom before it was Anne’s estranged ex-wife’s fiber art studio. Now it was something of a multiuse space. Above the desk across from the Pilates machine there was a lofted bed made up just for me. Lying in bed, I could look out the window and into the kitchen. Anne, illuminated from above with one sleeve rolled all the way up, appeared to be fishing something out of the garbage disposal, her arm pumping in and out and in and out of a void I could not see. 

“How’s that feel?” Anne’s fiancée asked. She was standing with one bare foot inside the tiny house and the other on the slate path that led to the regular-size one. I felt confused until Anne’s fiancée asked me how it smelled and I knew she was asking about the mattress, which had been purchased from the internet and come in a box. I said it smelled great.




On the walk to dinner, people waved at Anne and called her name across the street. A woman with lank hair drinking wine alone inside an expensive-looking restaurant tapped on the inside of the window as we passed and when Anne tapped back, the pretty waitress’s face inverted itself into a gracious smile. 

“That’s Valentina,” said Anne, meaningfully. I wasn’t sure if she meant the waitress or the woman but Anne’s fiancée nodded and said ohhh.

We went to a restaurant that Anne’s fiancée kept calling a jewel box and sat for several hours at a corner table, eating clams and bread. I realized then that although my parents were perfectly nice, they were neither smart nor interesting. Whereas Anne⁠—Anne could really talk. And her fiancée, she really knew how to ask questions. Occasionally, abruptly, the dynamic would reverse itself and Anne’s eyes would focus so hard on her fiancée’s mouth as it moved that I’d have to look, too. They were like two symbiotic organisms of different sizes but equal consequence and I was like a barnacle. Basically, I didn’t have to do anything at all and everyone was happy. 

Mussels arrived with an extra bowl for shells and Anne poured a very small amount of wine into the glass by my right hand. The sophistication conferred upon me by this gesture seemed somehow related to my ability to drink the wine very, very slowly. The wine was clear and so cold at first I almost couldn’t taste it. I tried to drink it at the rate that would make it the perfect amount but the food just kept coming and neither Anne nor her fiancée refilled my glass although it’s possible they didn’t notice when it was empty.

When the check came, Anne looked at the total and I tried to look too without looking like I was looking, less to see the number than Anne’s reaction to it, which was to make a satisfied sound and say we should really come here more often. I glanced up to see if she meant me, too, and found her fiancée studying me. Anne’s fiancée asked if I felt nervous for tomorrow. I said no. 

 “Oh, you’re gonna love it,” said Anne, putting her card down on a tray she passed over my head to the waiter waiting behind me. “It’s a great school. Rosie wouldn’t even tour it but⁠—” Anne’s fiancée put one hand on my shoulder and said Rose was the name of Anne’s child. The word child surprised me both because I’d forgotten Anne had one and also because it must be an adult by now.

“Too close to home, I guess,” I offered, and Anne stared at me for a second before she burst out laughing. Her fiancée laughed too, but less. 

“Close to home!” Anne said, taking the napkin from her lap and using it to dab theatrically at her eyes. “A women’s college! Ha!” I’d meant close literally, like, close on the map, but because I wanted to be in on the joke I said I’d gone to Catholic school my entire life and I wasn’t even Catholic. 

“So I’m pretty sure I can handle it,” I said. Anne laughed again, but less. Then her fiancée said something about single-sex educational environments and how, despite the obvious complexity, obviously, these days, obviously, she still saw a lot of merit in it, for some people, but not everyone, obviously.




At home, we ate gelato in a row along the kitchen counter. Anne and her fiancée were talking about the women’s college like I’d already committed myself to it, like I hadn’t gotten in or even applied anywhere else. Besides the women’s college, I’d gotten into a coed one that was otherwise basically the same, only slightly more expensive and in the Midwest. Also a university in my hometown, where I got automatic admission because of my high school class rank. Anne’s fiancée invited me to Thanksgiving and then Anne told a story about Rose coming home for Christmas with a nose piercing and a suitcase full of dirty laundry. I said Thanksgiving sounded great.

“College with no boys,” Anne’s fiancée said near the bottom of the carton. “I wish someone told me that was a thing!” 

“I bet you wish,” said Anne.

“And high school with no boys?” her fiancée continued, leaning forward to smile at me past Anne, who was seated between us. “You dodged a bullet with that one, trust me.” Then Anne’s fiancée took a giant bite, winced, pressed her thumb to the roof of her mouth, and whispered brain freeze, brain freeze. 

“With Rosie,” said Anne, “Ann and I considered girls’ school but⁠—”

 “Ann is Anne’s ex-wife,” Anne’s fiancée explained, “Ann with no e.”

“⁠—but for obvious reasons, the whole Catholic thing wasn’t going to work.” When Anne said the word Catholic, she did scare quotes with her free hand and the spoon. Then she looked at me like, no offense, and I shrugged like, none taken, which made her smile. “Catholic school,” she said. “I bet you girls get up to some trouble.” She said the word trouble in such a way that implied deeper meaning and I could guess what it was because it was true, a lot of girls did, but I didn’t, or I had, but only once.

“Do you still wear uniforms?” Anne’s fiancée prompted helpfully. “Do the nuns still wear, what’s that called, habits?” No nuns wore habits anymore except Sister Mary Benita, who taught English and read lips. People called her Sister Mary Bean Eater because she farted a lot. We called her that right to her face and she never knew the difference. Privately, I was uncomfortable with the idea that everyone might know something about you except you, especially for an extended period, one that you’d have to look back on later and try to explain.

“No habits,” I said. “We do either a skirt or slacks and senior year you wear a special tie.” Anne nodded appreciatively. Her fiancée offered me more gelato and when I shook my head no she returned the carton, almost empty, to the freezer, and wished me good night. Anne said she’d be up in a sec, then opened the junk drawer and fished out a vape pen. It was my first time ever smoking weed with an adult who hadn’t also sold me the weed. This felt to me like another important milestone.

That night, I lay in bed for a long time before I fell asleep and the next morning I lay in bed again, watching through the window while Anne’s fiancée made coffee. She was on her second cup before Anne appeared on the stairs. It was the only time I saw them kiss. Anne⁠—she almost had to reach up to do it, the height difference was so great⁠—grabbed her fiancée’s ass, then took a clean mug from the dish rack.




The drive wasn’t as long as I’d thought it would be. Anne had to take a work call that dropped halfway across the bridge, so we rolled down all the windows because Anne said putting the top down was a big hassle. When we reached the other side, Oakland, we rolled the windows back up again and she resumed her call, which was still going when we reached the campus gates. See you tomorrow, Anne mouthed before saying something into the phone about how to move forward. Good luck, Anne mouthed, as I grabbed my bag from the back seat. 

The office of admissions was located inside a boxy, deconsecrated chapel with a modern addition. Outside, there was a slitted vinyl banner that said REGISTER HERE! Inside, in the atrium, there were name tags and powdered doughnuts on a folding table with a lot of girls already crowded around it. The pews were gone and so was the altar but the chancel remained and the lectern, around which stackable chairs had been arranged in concentric half circles. In the side chapel there was a showcase of student art, thirty different charcoal drawings of the same naked person. Because each drawing was so different, it was impossible to tell what she would actually look like in real life. With a few truly awful exceptions, every one offered its own equally plausible version.

Then a girl wearing her name tag on the leg of her jeans came up behind me and asked if I was an artist too. The name tag said “sami,” all lowercase. When I said no, sami looked relieved, honestly. Then she asked me if I was an athlete and when I said no again she looked so lost I just said I wrote for the yearbook even though I quit that a long time ago.

“So you’re a writer,” said sami. 

“Well,” I said, “no.”

“Oh, don’t say that,” said sami brightly, “don’t put yourself down.” 

After that, the conversation kind of went nowhere. There was a man with sami who turned out to be her dad. Just to have something to say, I considered asking where sami’s mom was. Then the statuesque dean I remembered from my admissions interview approached the lectern and we all got to stop talking and sit down. 

“Some of you,” said the dean, “have already made your decision⁠—” A cheer rose up from the diverse cohort of current students filing in along the back wall, and the dean, beaming, made a motion that meant, raise the roof! “And others,” she said, “are still deciding.” There came another whoop, this time from someone seated very near me. I wondered what kind of person would want everyone to know they didn’t know what they wanted. “That’s what I’m talkin’ about!” said the dean, raising the roof again. “Everyone here deserves props! In fact, look to your left.” 

I looked at my lap because I was seated on the aisle. 

“Give your neighbor a pat on the back! And now, look right⁠—” 

I looked right at an adult, someone’s mother presumably, with short, puffy hair and little pill-shaped earrings. She smiled at me and offered her fist, which I bumped. All around us, I could hear the sounds of other people introducing themselves back and forth. I blushed and stared down at the woman’s sandals, which had a durable appearance. The woman seated on her other side was wearing the same sandals in a lighter shade of green. 

“Now, I know what you’re thinking,” said the dean as the woman to my right shifted in her seat, which creaked loudly. “You’re thinking, so, why a women’s college?” The woman sitting next to the woman sitting next to me reached one arm around that woman’s shoulders, draping her wrist across the seat back in such a way that her hand rested very near my own. It remained there while the dean relayed a story about the value of a liberal education in a community free from gender bias. Its value was priceless. Even⁠—“nay,” said the dean, holding up one finger, “especially”⁠—today, as our concepts of things like gender and bias were being challenged and expanded. When the dean said the words gender and bias, her eyes lit up. When she said the word expanded, she held her arms out like goalposts. The women seated next to me whispered to each other and I kept looking around so they wouldn’t think I was watching them or trying to listen. sami’s dad caught my eye and did a little wave. I looked down at myself and saw a fingerprint of powdered sugar on the front of my T-shirt. I moved my name tag to hide it. 

At the lectern, the dean was saying something about the changing landscape of higher education. I imagined the entire campus moving, like a sleeping body stirring beneath my feet. “Demographic change, technological advancement”⁠—the dean ticked these off on her fingers⁠—“affordability.” A lot of people crossed or uncrossed their legs at the same time. I turned to look at the other girls seated behind me. The most obvious difference between me and them was⁠—I was alone. 

After the dean’s speech and a Q&A, everyone’s parents left and the current students facilitated a trust-building exercise that involved breaking into small groups and recounting the worst thing that ever happened to you. When it was sami’s turn to talk, I felt very glad that I hadn’t asked earlier about her mom. 

Another game we played was writing all our identities down on the clean side of scrap paper, then crossing the identities out one by one until we were left with only the most important thing, which you had to read out loud to everyone. Most people were left with words like visionary or friend, or an extracurricular. Some people said what race they were, or the name of the country from which their parents or grandparents or they themselves had immigrated. Others, people who looked gay or sounded gay, said gay, or something like gay, or sometimes a team sport or theater or theater tech. An Asian girl said transracial adoptee, then one of the student facilitators⁠—she was white⁠—said she was pretty sure the correct term was actually transnational. 

“Transracial is something totally different,” said the student facilitator, helpfully. 

If I’d known how the game was going to end I would have done something more interesting, but by that time it was too late, so I had to stand up and say my name, my pronouns, and the significance of the word girl, to me, personally.




My overnight host was a second-year named Nicola who looked familiar for no reason because we came from different states. I wondered if we’d be lifelong friends. Lifelong friends was something my dad was always saying you’ll make at college, which puzzled me because except for people from work and my mom, who didn’t count, his only friend was Anne, whom I’d never met before yesterday. This led me to believe she and my dad hardly talked, whereas I talked to my friends all the time. I looked at Nicola and tried to imagine us talking about this someday, about my mistaking our special affinity for something so mundane as having gone to the same high school. In fact, Nicola had gone to Catholic school too, but she said she wasn’t Catholic either. She said she’d only applied here because they gave such good aid and probably wouldn’t even have come except they gave her a full ride. Then she said hosting me was her work-study job. 

“Well,” said Nicola, once these facts had been established, “wanna get out of here?” But before we could, the dean approached.

“Room for one more?” said the dean, making a face that meant, this isn’t really your decision to make. A small, furtive person appeared then out of nowhere, like one of the dancers that slip out from under the giant queen’s skirts halfway through The Nutcracker. 

“I’m Mac,” Mac said. Because of the identity game, I knew Mac was nonbinary. They were the first nonbinary person I ever met and they were wearing a denim vest with a pin on the collar that said BORN THIS WAY! “I really like your hair,” Mac said to me, eagerly. My hair was in a ponytail. Nicola snorted.

“Oh, you’ll fit right in,” she said and even though she said it to Mac, I still felt implicated, then confused. Because wasn’t that the point of all this⁠—to assess the extent to which one did or did not fit? I looked at Mac, less for reassurance than for an example of one possible way to act. Mac was grinning and trying to hide it by staring down at their boots. Nicola and Mac were wearing the same brand of boots, but Mac’s had rainbow laces. The dean seemed basically oblivious. She said she was so, so excited for us, then left to talk to the next group.




Nicola’s bedroom was on the first floor of an H-shaped building that had been specially designed in the sixties to deter student riots. The blond lawn outside was overgrown and there were stains on the carpet in the hall, but Nicola didn’t have a roommate. 

“Underenrollment,” she explained, blithely. The twin beds had been pushed together to make one giant bed with a crack down the middle. There was, in one corner, a sink, which Nicola forbade us from using. Mac began to blow up the air mattress, then stopped because of asthma, so I finished while they looked around Nicola’s room.

Rather than viewing it panoramically, Mac turned their attention from one object to the next with deliberate intensity, like they were looking at everything through a telephoto lens or a microscope and taking notes.

“I like your laptop case,” said Mac. “I like your duvet cover. I like your lofted desks.” The desks were vertically stacked; it was difficult to imagine how you might use either one. Mac turned to Nicola. “But don’t you wish you had a roommate?” Mac asked, and Nicola, who was using one fingernail to clean her other finger­nails, said no, never, without even thinking about it or looking up. “I for sure want one,” Mac said and I exhaled as we made eye contact, my lips still locked around the gummy plastic valve. “Don’t you?” Mac asked. 

I looked down at the mattress hanging limp like a conjoined twin down my front. Spend too much time deciding, I knew, and the decision would get made for you, either by an impatient authority or some unforeseen logistic that would render the point moot by making what you wanted suddenly less relevant than what was already happening to you.

“Hypothetically,” Mac coaxed.

“It’s randomly assigned,” Nicola said, like we were acting stupid. Mac shrugged, then read the poems tacked to Nicola’s wall.

“I like them,” Mac said, decisively.

“They’re my boyfriend’s,” said Nicola.




We were supposed to shadow Nicola to an academic class but she said the professor was fascist so we just took a walk instead. There was a tall fence around campus and through its complex latticework you could see Oakland, the working people of Oakland, and the businesses of Oakland. Nicola told Mac and me that if we moved to Oakland, we’d have to think a lot about gentrification. Because you’re white, she said. Mac asked eagerly what it was, exactly, we were supposed to be thinking, but Nicola wouldn’t say, although presumably she must have known because she was white, too. 

Mac asked Nicola what her major was and Nicola said she was thinking of doing the thing where you design your own but technically she was still undecided. Mac said I think you must mean undeclared and then Nicola shifted into the middle of the path so Mac and I were forced to fall into step behind her. Through the fence you now could see some woods and trees and a series of green-brown hills. 

We ran into Nicola’s friend Patrice smoking a cigarette and when she finished we went up to see her room, which was on the top floor of a new-new environmental dorm I recognized from the pamphlet. Patrice’s room was larger than Nicola’s but contained, like hers, one giant bed with a crack down the middle. There was a blue glass window but the window didn’t open. 

“Patrice doesn’t have a roommate either?” Mac asked Nicola when we left. 

“No,” said Nicola, “Patrice lives with this girl Eun-Kyung.”

“So, they’re dating?” Mac asked. 

“No,” Nicola said. “They just sleep together.” And then we went to dinner. 

The dining hall was on top of a hill. Inside the dining hall there was a conveyor belt that carried dirty dishes through a hole in the wall to another room concealed behind a wet rubber curtain. We ate dinner and then we ate dry cereal out of plastic bowls. Mac wouldn’t stop talking about the future. 

“I’m gonna join the bike co-op,” they said, “I’m gonna join the book co-op and the solidarity house and the outdoors club.” 

“The book co-op is defunct,” said Nicola. “The outdoors club was consolidated.” Mac asked what I wanted to do. I said I didn’t know yet. Mac just kept looking at me.

“Yearbook,” I lied. 

“There’s no yearbook in college,” said Nicola. She was tipping back in her chair to balance on its back legs. 

“Well, what do you do now?” Mac asked, pragmatically. “What’s your thing?”

“Catechism,” Nicola said, teasing me, but not meanly, I hoped. “Communion. Confession⁠—” 

“You go to Catholic school?” Mac whispered the word Catholic.

“Yeah, but I’m not Catholic,” I clarified.

“I figured,” said Mac.

Two girls walked past our table. I noticed them because they were looking at me, I thought, and then they stopped to say hi to Nicola. Nicola pitched forward in her chair, then sat normally for a second before standing up to say hi back. Both girls were wearing soccer shorts with tall soccer socks scrunched down around their ankles. Each one was carrying her own brown plastic glass of milk. Eventually, when it became clear we weren’t going to get introduced, Mac turned to face me. 

“So what,” Mac asked, “do you guys, like, wear uniforms? Do people ever, you know⁠—”

“Sometimes,” I said.

“Cool,” said Mac just as Nicola returned to the table and started stacking plates. 

“My ex,” Nicola said dispassionately, but she didn’t say which one.

“Cool,” said Mac.




Back in Nicola’s room, Nicola sat on a beanbag and looked at her phone. Mac and I were on the floor. When I finished my first beer, they leapt up to get me another, which they even succeeded in opening using the magnetic boobs-shaped opener. They sat back down beside me and wrapped an arm around my midsection, then pulled back to ask is this okay. I nodded yes but Mac just stared at me blankly until I said yes, out loud. Then they leaned in again, put their lips upon my earlobe, and sucked. I wondered if my piercing tasted the same way it smelled when I changed the stud or twisted it in class, woundish and fishy. There was a tap on the window and Mac drew away. 

“It’s open,” Nicola yelled and the window opened and a boy with very long legs stepped through. He had short locs and wore a button-down shirt open over a band T-shirt, like Kurt Cobain, I thought. Or like a mixed-race Kurt Cobain. 

“Wow,” he said, “they really are young,” and then he stepped over Mac, knelt beside Nicola, and kissed her on the mouth. Mac looked at me like, can you believe these people? But I couldn’t stop watching the kiss as it continued to happen, right there in front of us, like a dancer falling down or a dog getting hit by a car. 

Mac said they smoked weed every day but I could tell they were lying by the way they hit Nicola’s boyfriend’s bong. For the next several hours, Mac pretended to be really high. They kept saying how high they were and asking me if I could feel it. Then the bong came back around again and after that, I actually had to hold them upright as we stumbled after Nicola and her boyfriend through the dark woods toward the edge of campus. There, I expected to find a gap in the fence, but instead we came to a clearing with a rope swing and a deep hole. Nicola swung on the swing and her boyfriend used a child-size beach shovel to widen the hole. When he jumped down into it, his whole body disappeared, except his head.

“Hole &hellip body!!!” Mac whispered. “Get it?” We were sitting side by side on a rotting log. They asked is this okay and I said yes even though I was wearing a pair of underwear I’d owned since middle school. Mac picked at the little sewn-on bow like it was some kind of scab. Nicola, who’d ceased to swing, got down on her hands and knees to kiss her boyfriend, who was still standing in the hole. Over his shoulder, Nicola and I kept making eye contact and I felt embarrassed until it occurred to me that she might not care what I saw or by extension thought, by which time she was already straightening up, brushing the soil off her jeans, and saying it was time to go. 

In Nicola’s dorm room, we smoked more weed and then watched The Wizard of Oz on her laptop while The Dark Side of the Moon played on her boyfriend’s phone speaker, which was his idea. Whenever the Tin Man appeared, Mac would say what a queer icon he was. Soon, it was obvious that Nicola and her boyfriend were having sex, or something like sex, beneath the duvet. It was already the scene where Dorothy falls asleep. I lay down on the air mattress, which was slowly deflating, and Mac lay down beside me. 

“Is this okay?” Mac asked and I said yes out loud, finding I liked the feeling of knowing my part and doing it. After a while, Mac asked, “How’s that feel?” I said it felt great. Then Mac tried to undo the drawstring on my pajama shorts but succeeded only in tightening the knot. The next morning, I had to use the tiny scissors from Nicola’s travel manicure kit to unpick myself free. It took so long I almost peed my pants, and when I returned from the bathroom, her boyfriend was relieving himself in the sink.




Nicola bought Mac and me one coffee to share from a cart in the science annex. Then we sat together on a bench on the quad while Nicola explained some key takeaways from the class she was skipping to hang out with us instead. The class was called either the Psychology of Adolescence or the Psychology of Adolescents. When I asked which one, Nicola cocked her head to one side and said she’d never thought about it like that before.

Then it was time to go. Everyone returned to the lawn outside admissions. The banner was gone but there were doughnuts again, arranged in the same pattern on the same plate. I saw sami talking to her dad and the two women who’d sat beside me the day before. I was watching them embrace their daughter, the adopted one, when Mac came rushing at me through the crowd. 

“I’ll see you in the fall,” they cried, gazing up at me with such desperate intensity all I could say was we’ll see. Grinning suddenly, Mac shot up to grip my shoulder, hard. “I thought I was the only one,” they said. My confusion must have shown, because they looked in both directions before standing on tiptoe to whisper in my ear, “I’m on the wait list, too!” I didn’t correct them. They asked is this okay then kissed me on the cheek before boarding the shuttle to the airport. 

Nicola and I sat together on the lawn and waited while she explained a whole book she was reading. I ripped grass into dots and dashes I arranged in lines like code on my pant leg. The book was about why gay identity can only really exist because of capitalism. 

“Because of bourgeois capitalism,” Nicola clarified. I wound a grass stem around my finger, which turned pink then white then yellow. Nicola checked the time on her phone. It was just us and the dean and the student workers in their matching polos, stacking chairs and folding tables. I told Nicola she didn’t have to wait with me. She shrugged, checked her phone again, and asked if I wanted to see something crazy.

When we were out of sight behind some dumpsters, Nicola showed me a tampon. She unscrewed the top and inside, there was a joint. I assumed this was the crazy thing until after we’d smoked it, when Nicola beckoned me around the back side of a building and we slipped in together through a service entrance.

The air was cold and I saw, once my eyes adjusted, chairs and tables, a furled banner, the lectern. Then I saw the figure drawings on the wall. Nicola moved slowly toward them with tremendous cere­mony and stood looking for what felt like a long time before she turned to look back at me, her face illuminated by her phone light. 

“They’re me,” she said, finally, triumphantly, “they’re all me.” “That’s me,” she said, training the light on one where she looked really thin. “And that’s me.” She pointed to one where she had freckles. It was too dark to see if she really had freckles. She never had hands. She rarely had a face⁠—perhaps that was why I’d failed to recognize her. Nicola illuminated one of the worst. “Justine did this one,” she said, meaningfully, but in the dark, the meaning was hard to catch.

“It’s a great likeness,” I lied. I hadn’t met Justine. Nicola’s ex was named something else⁠—Mac had asked⁠—but I couldn’t remember now.

“Oh, you know how it is,” Nicola said, “when someone likes you more than you like them.” I nodded cautiously. “Justine’s, like, so in love with me. But I’m always like, girl, it’s not going to happen and she’s like, I totally get it and I respect your boundaries! But then I see this”⁠—Nicola tapped the drawing with two fingers⁠—“and I’m like …” She groaned but she was smiling. “Like, I love Justine, obviously. I’m like, I do love you, Justine, but not like that, and then Justine is like, identity is a construct⁠—which I’m like, like, duh! Being gay is a choice⁠—” Nicola stopped speaking and shone her phone light in my face. “Do you get what I’m saying?” she asked. “Not that it’s a bad thing. I mean, like, it’s a choice you get to just make anytime⁠—”

“I get it,” I said, shielding my eyes until Nicola moved the light. It was a familiar concept but I’d never heard it phrased so simply.

“⁠—and Justine’s like, if you really loved me you’d just make the choice to be my lover and I’m like, PLEASE, God, don’t say lover.” Nicola sighed and threw her hands up in the air so her phone light made a bent coin on the high ceiling. Then we stood together for a while, just looking at Justine’s drawing.

“Do you really have that mole?” I asked after a while and Nicola pulled down her pants to show me the mole, then pulled them up again, jumping to do the fly.




We stepped blinking into the sun just as the hybrid slid up to the curb. Anne’s fiancée was behind the wheel, waving frantically out the window and calling my name. Outlined behind her I could see Anne, holding her phone with her shoulder. Because of the angle, it looked for a second like they were one body and then the angle changed again.

“Oh shit,” said Nicola, squinting. “Is that your mom?” 

The trunk opened itself slowly, like a mouth. The seat belt was very modern. By the time I figured it out, we were already way off campus, in the center of a busy intersection where Anne’s fiancée kept missing her chance to make an unprotected left. She didn’t seem worried about it, nor did Anne, who had an open laptop balanced on her knees. “I said,” Anne’s fiancée said, glancing at me and then back at the oncoming traffic, “did you have fun! Was it fun! You must be so worn out!” In the rearview, I watched Anne cover the lower half of her cell phone like it was an old-fashioned phone with a receiver. 

“She certainly looks worn out,” Anne said, smiling, and I looked at myself in the rearview, too, slumping down so I could see my eyes, which were red. 

“Did you sleep at all!” Anne’s fiancée asked after we turned, finally, and the blinker stopped chiming. “You must be exhausted! Do you have to go to school tomorrow! Do you like school? You must be almost done!”

“You know what they say,” Anne said, “it gets better.” She said it like it was a joke but I wasn’t sure if I should laugh or not and then it was too late because she was talking into the phone again, saying something about optimization. 

“Did you get to see Oakland!” Anne’s fiancée continued. “What classes did you go to!” And then we merged onto a freeway behind a long line of stopped cars. “Aghhh!” said Anne’s fiancée. “We’re gonna miss your flight!” But she said it cheerfully, so cheerfully I hoped we would, but we didn’t, it wasn’t even close.




The next morning I found that the admissions pamphlets crowding the corkboard outside the principal’s office had been replaced with a laminated map of the United States. Already there were several thumbtacks stuck in and around the gold star-shaped sticker that made my town look a lot bigger than it actually was, relative to everything around it. A dense cluster of tiny, empty holes, evidence of last year’s class and the year before that, radiated out from the star, thinning gradually toward the coasts. There were a few holes in Los Angeles and one on the dot labeled San Francisco, which crowded out Oakland almost entirely. At lunch, I passed the map again and saw a new tack back east, presumably put there by Hannah Beale, who’d gotten into Brown early decision and now only talked about Providence. Girls who weren’t going to college were supposed to write their plans on a sticky note in the corner. 

A few days later, a different women’s college in another state declared bankruptcy. Underenrollment, my dad speculated⁠—the campus would be sold at auction, to an old folks’ home or a for-profit university. All those girls would have to transfer now or take time off to decide what to do next. I received a phone call from the dean. She said she wanted to make herself available to answer any new questions I might be having, if any, as to the financial solvency of the college. When I said I had none she reminded me Decision Day was coming up, and a deposit was due on the first. I thanked her and hung up. My dad made a joke about me having to move home again, before he got serious and said it was up to me, of course, whatever I wanted, we would make it work. I said I know, and I did know, but I knew also that there were other factors to consider. This kind of came as a relief.

 In the end, I accepted the other offer⁠—one with loans⁠—from the coed liberal arts college in the Midwest. I walked up to the map, so crowded now with tacks that the gold star didn’t even exist anymore, and stuck mine a hairsbreadth from Lake Erie. Sister Mary Alvin handed me a palm-size sticker of a red-tailed hawk wearing a mortarboard (our mascot was the red-tailed hawk).

“This is the first day of the rest of your life!” she said. And then the bell rang, and I climbed the stairs to English."

    "text": "In March, Gibson flew to Chicago. His girlfriend was in a graduate program there studying literature, and one night the two of them went to dinner at her professor’s house. Gibson was a professor too. Most of his students were poor. So was Gibson. He suspected that he wouldn’t have liked teaching at the school his girlfriend attended, but he knew it wasn’t anything he would ever have to worry about. During dinner, the professor asked questions about Gibson’s school, saying that he imagined his experience was different from Gibson’s, because his students were privileged and Gibson’s were less so. For a few minutes, the conversation sputtered. The professor opened up another bottle of wine, and then he, his wife, and Gibson’s girlfriend—all poets—argued about poetry. Gibson didn’t drink. He also didn’t write poems. He didn’t drink because he was an alcoholic, and he didn’t write poetry because he wasn’t good at it. “If only that stopped more people,” the professor said.

By the end of dinner, Gibson’s girlfriend, her professor, and the professor’s wife were very drunk. They started arguing about a writer. Close to midnight, the professor slammed his hand down on the table, and when he raised it back up again the sharp edge of a knife was stuck into his palm. For a moment, they were all entranced by this. It seemed like a miracle. Then the professor shook his hand and the knife fell onto his plate. “My God,” the professor said. The wound began to pour blood. After that, the professor’s wife swooped the professor over to the sink. Gibson’s girlfriend said she was dizzy, and the two of them went to a couch.

A minute later, the professor’s five-year-old daughter came out of her room. She wore a tiara and a burgundy costume dress that implied Renaissance Faire. The walls were bookshelves, and the girl took down a thick novel with a bright orange cover, sat down on a different couch, and started reading. The girl’s couch was underneath the far window, and the way she slipped in between two pillows made it seem as if she was playing a game in which no one could see her. She wasn’t all that concerned about her father, who was swearing in the kitchen. Instead, she concentrated on her book. Gibson knew that certain children had crazy sleep schedules, or that sometimes parents made exceptions when they had company, but still he thought it was odd that she was awake and that no one seemed to care. He wanted to ask her what her bedtime was, but he wasn’t her father. Also, he had a hard rule against interrupting anyone while they were reading, and he guessed that included children.

When Gibson had first arrived and was introduced to the girl, either the professor or his wife had suggested their daughter would grow up to be a writer. Other than their own projections of themselves, Gibson wasn’t sure what this forecast was based upon. But Gibson had the idea in his head now. He knew poets, and the girl wasn’t one. She lacked the heroic self-consciousness: that nervous, ecstatic way a poet let you know there was a person inside of them. So, a fiction writer. There was, in fact, a certain Cheever-ness to her situation, her WASP-y, tenured father bleeding in the kitchen. Because of that, the girl’s childhood felt classic.

Whenever Gibson tried to write about his childhood, he was shocked by how violent it had been. He remembered a story he’d wanted to write about his mother’s friend John. Each version of the story had come out a confused mess, but the plot, pieced together over the years, was simple. John owed some money. He didn’t pay it back. Bikers beat him to death. Right before John died, Gibson and his mother went to the hospital to pay him a visit. Gibson had probably been around the girl’s age. That day, his mother was on a lot of drugs. She pointed at John, who was intubated. “Motorcycle accident,” his mother had said. The story had defeated Gibson for years.

Because everything about the professor offended him, Gibson assumed that the girl would grow up to hate her father. Sitting across from her, Gibson imagined that she might, as an adult, write a short story where a girl comes home from school. Around the corner from her house, she sees her father kissing a depressed graduate student. Something like that. Up to her.




In Chicago, Gibson went to the same coffee shop every day. The people who worked there knew his face. He preferred his coffee black with two ice cubes because he wanted to drink it fast and not sip at it. The morning after the professor’s house, when he ordered his coffee, the manager was training a new barista. “Be careful with this guy’s drink,” the manager said. She jerked her head at Gibson. “He’s got the tongue of an infant.”

Afterward, Gibson walked across the street to the School of Business. He treated it like an office. The first floor was a clean, Apple Store–like atrium with floor-to-ceiling windows that looked out onto the other buildings on campus. He sat down to work on a story. For two weeks every draft he’d written and trashed had begun with someone driving a car. He would try to put the characters somewhere else—a kitchen, an empty auditorium, the waiting room of a doctor’s office—but then, somehow, they’d end up back in the car. These things happened. In almost every Faulkner novel there was a character walking in a very straight line. The most obvious example was in As I Lay Dying, when Jewel, rather than walk around a house, strides through one open window and out the other. Light in August began the same way—with Lena walking “a fur piece,” which Gibson had read meant traveling a distance of fifty miles. Gibson didn’t know if that meant fifty miles straight exactly, but he preferred to think of it in this way.

He stood up and stretched. It was Gibson’s spring break, but not his girlfriend’s. She was in the humanities library across campus, where the students did stress like other kids did drugs. They craved it. The year before, Gibson’s girlfriend had been reading in the library, and in the carrel next to hers an undergraduate had climbed under the desk, gone into a mumbling trance state, and refused to come out. Meanwhile, in the School of Business, everyone was smiling or having lunch. No one feared death. They wouldn’t even know what you were talking about. The shiny marble floor in the atrium and the enormous potted ferns and the windows at funky angles framed them like TV actors.

Sitting down again, Gibson thought of a day with his mother, almost a year ago, when the doctors had brought in a physical therapist. His mother was filled with toxins from drinking—with ammonia and worse—and they wanted to see how her body would handle the action. She’d been in the hospital for three weeks, and everything they’d tried, every procedure, hadn’t helped her.

When the physical therapist arrived for the appointment Gibson took an immediate dislike to her. His mother was nervous about walking. She was terrified. The PT didn’t seem to care. She was blond and fit. “Ready to get the blood pumping?” the PT asked. His mother was in the hospital because her organs were shutting down. She was the color of a plantain.

The PT looked at his mother’s chart. “Not good,” the PT said. “You haven’t been taking care of yourself. Good thing today is the first day of the rest of your life.” Gibson could forgive and even appreciate someone for saying this if they meant it, but the PT didn’t. Over time, Gibson had come to believe there was always some event or series of events in the life of a person that made them realize the world was broken and that, because of this, they needed to be gentle with it. When he came across someone who seemed not to have had this experience, he wanted to punish them.

“I’m very busy today,” the PT said, setting up the walker. “Are we ready?”

Gibson’s girlfriend was there too. She’d been there from the beginning—dropping everything. “This is a bad idea, Alan,” she said, but Gibson was angry enough at his mother and the PT—he thought they were different sorts of fools—that he let it go on.

He helped the PT get his mother out of bed. The PT said she wanted to do this thing. She and Gibson’s mother started their trip around the nurses’ station, an area the PT called the pod. His mother would push one step and be exhausted. Fifty feet took an hour. On the last curve, as his mother slumped over the walker, he saw the disgust and worry on the PT’s face, and his victory felt monstrous.

After a few hours’ work, Gibson saw the professor’s wife and daughter coming out of the restrooms across the atrium. The professor’s wife’s name was Ann. She was carrying four or five paper shopping bags by their twine handles and at the same time holding her daughter’s hand, but when she saw Gibson she nodded at him and came over.

“Kill me,” she said, and Gibson smiled. She asked Gibson how he was, and he said fine, and then she apologized for the way her husband had impaled his own hand with a steak knife.

“I’ve done worse,” Gibson said.

“That sounds like a story,” she said.

“It isn’t,” Gibson said, and then he felt bad for being short. “The story is that I’m an idiot,” he said. “Why do you have so many shopping bags?”

“Dinner party,” Ann said.

“Another one?”

“It’s a never-ending series of these things.”

While Ann complained about Victorianists, her daughter scanned the atrium, watching people, taking them in. Gibson was reminded of what he’d found impressive about her the other night—the fact that she already read so well. While her father was in the kitchen bleeding, she had read for the better part of an hour. Gibson couldn’t read at five, or six, or even seven. And he certainly couldn’t write. He would jam consonants together in the hope that by some accident or miracle a word might happen. Back then, like now, language made him angry. Since his mother’s death, his language had taken on a detective-novel tone. It was cold, quick. It was driving around in a car.




That night, he and his girlfriend streamed a Nordic crime drama. The show took place in two countries separated by a river or some other body of water over which a bridge spanned. A person from one country would cross that body of water and ask themselves: Where am I? What’s going on? Gibson’s girlfriend didn’t usually drink as much as she had at the professor’s house, and halfway through the second episode, she fell asleep. The weight of her head against his shoulder was a reminder of how irritated he still was. Coming back from the professor’s house, his girlfriend had kept saying how bad she felt. “You’re mad,” she’d said, as Gibson helped her up the stairs. “I can tell.” In all the years they’d been together, he could count on two fingers the number of times his girlfriend had been that drunk. Gibson had stopped drinking before they’d met.

He went to the balcony to smoke. His girlfriend’s apartment was on the second floor of a Modernist building he thought was in a Z shape, or maybe a W, or some weird, lopsided X. The apartments across the courtyard, on the other side of the building, weren’t far at all. The building was mostly graduate students, or people who worked nine-to-five jobs at the university. He would see these people in the hallway of his girlfriend’s building and then, later, behind a desk at the library.

Across the courtyard, in soft yellow light, was a kitchen. A woman stood in front of the stove. Her apartment was fifty feet away, maybe less. Gibson was worried that if the woman turned around he would come off as a creep, but he wanted to finish his cigarette, so he kept smoking. After another few seconds, he heard a baby cry. It wasn’t a soft cry but an awful wail. The baby’s cry and the woman’s slumped, tired posture came together in his mind. Last year, he’d held the front door open for the woman, who’d been pregnant. “Thank you,” she’d said, in an accent he couldn’t place.

In the kitchen, the woman didn’t move at all. The child took a breath, and in that new silence the electric hum of the building swept in like cicadas. When the baby cried again, the woman lit a burner on the stove. It was a blue gas flame, like a star. Gibson watched as the woman brought her hand down into it and then slowly lifted it back up.

His mother had been lonely. That was the disease. His mother’s father, Gibson’s grandfather, had died the same way. Maybe Gibson would too. Years earlier, Gibson had been drunk for several days, gone to a party, and run his mouth to the wrong person. A stranger, a man Gibson would never see again, broke Gibson’s jaw into twenty-seven pieces. After the operation, when he woke up in the hospital, his mother was there. At that point in her life, she was sober. It had been his turn to drink.

“You’re alive,” she said.

He didn’t feel like it. His mother said he was on Dilaudid. She explained to him how, instead of wiring his jaw shut, they had rigged each individual tooth. If Gibson could manage it, he could talk, but only if he wanted.

When he closed his eyes, he saw two little girls running through a field of daisies. They were nine and seven—he somehow knew this. As the girls ran, they laughed, and picked flowers, and had a wonderful time. When he opened his eyes, the girls were still there. They were putting the flowers they’d picked into his mother’s hair.

Gibson told his mother what he was seeing.

“Okay, honey,” his mother said. “That’s the Dilaudid. We’ll get you on something else.”




Since dinner at the professor’s house, Gibson had taken to making fun of him to his girlfriend—nothing too mean: cracks about the professor cutting off his fingers and toes. One day, while they were smoking on the balcony, his girlfriend told him she didn’t think these jokes were very funny. She liked the professor. She respected him. He was incredibly smart, she said, and he had taught her a lot. Gibson’s girlfriend thought that if Gibson got to know the professor, he would like him, too.

Gibson wasn’t sure about that, but he did like Ann. It was her work Gibson had read, and not the professor’s. At dinner, before they’d sat down, she kept offering him juices she thought they had but didn’t. “I’m good with water,” he finally said. For ten minutes in the kitchen, they had spoken about their families. Ann’s brother had died when he was young—car accident—and even though Gibson knew about this already, from an interview, he hadn’t let on. Ann wondered about Gibson’s brother, and if they were close. He told her they were.

“Do you hang out a lot?” she asked. “Do you talk on the phone?”

“No,” he said. “Not really.”

“Then how do you know you’re close?”

He had realized she was genuinely asking.

Gibson’s brother hadn’t been around when their mother was moved to the ICU, but he’d helped make that decision. There had been a meeting with the team in a special conference room. The kidney doctor was there, and the numbers man, too. Earlier that day, the numbers man had come into his mother’s hospital room and gone over to the other side of the curtain where her roommate slept. This woman also had sons. They were big, quiet ghouls. It seemed as if they moved from the doorway to their mother on conveyor belts. The numbers man tried to explain death to these men but they were impenetrable.

At their team meeting, Gibson and his brother listened. They nodded. After the other doctors were finished talking, they turned to the numbers man. He pressed his lips together and frowned.

One morning, Gibson took the elevator up to see her. When he got to his mother’s room, he went to kiss her on the cheek, but the surprised, terrified look on her face stopped him. A breaker had tripped inside her mind. He asked his mother if she was okay, but she could no longer speak. All this might have come as a shock, but Gibson had seen it before with his father. People vanished. They were right there and then they were gone. During the time his mother had been sober she had been a person, like anybody. They happened to have liked each other. An hour later, his mother knew her name again, but a soft-spoken nurse told Gibson it was only a matter of time, and that if there were things that he needed settled he should get on with it. She didn’t mean feelings.

Gibson’s girlfriend called twelve notaries. He needed power of attorney over his mother to access her accounts. He worried that, without power of attorney, everything would get tied up in probate and he’d lose the house. One notary got back to them, an older guy. Gibson met him outside the hospital. For some reason, Gibson told the notary his whole life story. There were seagulls screaming in the parking lot. The guy had a tan field jacket on. He didn’t flinch.

“My sister drank,” he said. “What you’re saying is really too bad.”

They went upstairs and tried to explain the situation to his mother: how she would need to sign the form—could she do that?— and spare them more disaster.

“Oh. Kay. Al. Eee,” she said.

Everything moved fast. It had a certain rhythm there wasn’t any getting around. Gibson’s girlfriend said she’d serve as witness. Gibson’s brother had driven in, and the two of them went out into the hall. A minute later, when the notary approached them with the signature, he frowned. “I can’t use this,” he said, and showed them. Gibson’s mother’s signature looked like a doodle of a fence post.

“Let me talk to her,” Gibson said.

With the notary, he walked back into his mother’s room. He asked her to try again.

“Oh. Kay. Al. Eee.”

They tried again with a new, clean form. Gibson stayed in the room. He jammed the pen into his mother’s hand.

“Why don’t you look out the window?” Gibson’s girlfriend asked the notary.

“You know what?” the notary said. “I think I will.”

Gibson placed his hand over his mother’s fist and guided her name. When they were done, the notary resumed his presence in the room. He looked at the form.

“Works for me,” he said. “Fuck ’em.”




A day later, they moved his mother across the street to a brand-new, state-of-the-art hospice center. It looked like a ski lodge. His mother’s room was bigger than the first floor of her house. Because the hospice was new, the palliative care doctor was able to sneak her in without the insurance company knowing what was going on. It was a matter of new codes. He’d pulled a fast one.

His mother wanted to keep the reason why she was in the hospital a secret. She’d made Gibson promise he wouldn’t tell anyone, and even after she stopped speaking, and her eyes drifted across his face without focus, he kept his word with certain people. When her friends from work came to visit, he mumbled explanations that didn’t make any sense. Her sisters, all four of them, knew.

One night, they arrived. His aunts sat down on the long couch in the separate living area. He thought he’d like to write a novel about his mother’s family. The first line would be: “The five of them were so different from one another that they were more like a pickup basketball team than sisters.” When they were together their personalities could cause friction. A comment, a gesture, some memory—they’d break into sighs and eye rolls. “Oh, come on!” they’d shout, with the certainty of forgiveness.

That night, Gibson left his mother alone with his brother and aunts and went downstairs to the hospice center’s great room. Standing in front of the fireplace was a man. A little girl and a little boy were behind him in a wingback chair. They were the man’s children, and Gibson knew this because he’d seen them all together earlier that day, leaving a patient’s room. By the force of the man’s sadness, Gibson also knew that the patient was his wife, and that soon the children would be left alone with him for good. He had the urge to turn around and walk away. The girl was older than the boy by a few years. The father, noticing Gibson, nodded at him.

“Say hello,” the father said to his children.

They didn’t care about that.

“I want to go home,” the boy said.

The girl leaned over to fix her brother’s collar, the left side of which had popped.

“We can’t right now,” she said.




When Gibson was a boy, his mother had stood over his shoulder whenever he did his spelling. If he made a mistake, she would say, “Stop. Erase it. Try again.”

After his mother had first been admitted to the hospital, Gibson and his brother had rushed to her. That day, Gibson and his brother were angry. They each had a temper, anyway: sudden flare-ups, a penchant for being irritated; they took offense. Gibson and his brother told her they were disappointed. After all this time—why start drinking again? What was the matter with her?

In the hospice, when Gibson came back from downstairs, he tried again. He combed his mother’s hair one last time. He tucked her arms under her blanket to keep out the cold. When she opened her eyes for a fraction of a second, he said hello. Then he and his brother and aunts stood around his mother and touched her arms, her legs, her head. They stood there for a long time. No one said a word.




His last night in Chicago, Gibson and his girlfriend went to a reading in a converted chapel on campus. They grabbed a pew in the back. The professor ran the reading series, and he went to the podium to give an introduction. Gibson had read the writer’s books—every single one—and it was clear that the professor had as well. The professor said that for him the writer’s stories had turned into one big story in his mind. Maybe, Gibson thought, he wasn’t such a bad guy. While it was true that Gibson had never read any of the professor’s poems, he had read an essay the professor had published about the writer. At the time, he’d thought it was very good.

Everyone clapped as the professor went down to meet the writer on the stairs and assisted her up to the podium. There the writer put on her reading glasses. Through the stained-glass window behind her, Gibson could see the last of the sun hanging on. He watched the professor take his seat in the front row next to Ann. He looked for the daughter, but she was nowhere to be found. The writer drank from a glass of water and opened her book. She cleared her throat. She thanked everyone for coming. There followed a long, eerie silence. Gibson sat back in the pew for a second. He waited. Then he leaned forward."

    "text": "“This is my husband, Desmond,” Gemma tells the driving instructor. “He wants to sit in the back.” 

“Des!” Desmond jousts forward with his pale hand.

The driving instructor⁠—a man in his late seventies, of a chimney sweeper’s build that makes Gemma envious⁠—accepts the hand as he might a cup of milky tea when he’d asked for it black, and waits for the situation to explain itself. 

It’s a Sunday, at 8 A.M., and the three of them are stood around a white line in the almost-empty Lidl car park in Newbridge beside the replacement vehicle. Before it was totaled, their car had been a baby blue second-generation Fiat Panda with an Italian registration and a bumper sticker of Michelangelo’s David gesturing “Ma che cazzo?!”

When they repatriated to Ireland after a decade together in Rome, Gemma and Des had kept their Panda, partly because of Ireland’s nutcracking expensiveness and partly because having a left-hand drive in a right-hand-drive country cast them as tourists in the country of their birth: true to how Gemma felt, and in keeping with Desmond’s being constantly peckish, his surveying the place with squinting bemusement. But having a wrong-sided vehicle also meant that the only way to navigate the country roads, with all their ditherments, was to have a passenger in the car always, pressing their cheek to the side window, telling the driver, Yeah, you’re fine, or, Plunge into the thicket for the love of jeeezus. 

“I have a license and everything,” Gemma tells the instructor. “It’s just …” She glances at her husband, who is scanning Lidl’s advertisements for radically discounted gourds and green chocolate witches. “We were in a crash. I think I mentioned on the voicemail?” She’d blathered until the beep cut short her hushed account. A few days later, she received a confirmatory text with strange punctuation and no clue as to how much of the message he’d heard.

The instructor lowers his head, and Gemma can’t but notice his coverage⁠—there are probably three hairs coming out of each follicle, if not four. This is a man who cooks porridge on the stove and not in the microwave. He’d been recommended by Gemma’s physio, as a “retired driving instructor who still does special cases.” 

“Our Panda was totaled,” she says. 

It wasn’t on a bendy boreen but on the M7 to Dublin that they’d taken a pounding, at the end of their first month in Ireland. They’d been on their way back from visiting Desmond’s father, whose Alzheimer’s diagnosis had prompted the move. Des pulled into the emergency lane because smoke was discharging from their bonnet⁠—very faint, less a cigarette’s worth than a vape’s. Ignoring Gemma’s pleas to wait until the next exit to pull over, Desmond determined to act. He knew what needed to be done. He was under the hood⁠—with the same gusto, to be fair, that he often brought to the bedroom⁠—for several minutes before returning to his seat with a frown. “I’m sure it just needs lube!” Gemma said, as he went for his seat belt. They were the last words she spoke at volume for weeks. Desmond hadn’t waited long enough to pull back out into the traffic; he hadn’t given the truck that was indicating enough time to change lanes. Unlike Desmond, she hadn’t seen the truck louring over her, the material of the car exploding around her like a wave. Her memory, after a moment of darkness, is of a bright and airy scene … no windows left in the car, airbag lint snow-globing around them. The scent was of pasta water left in the pot. “Our car, I mean,” Gemma says. “It was a write-off.”

“Fiat?” the instructor asks. This is the first thing he’s said since shaking their hands. 

“We brought it over from Italy,” she says. “It was a left-hand drive.”

 The instructor raises his hand in the air and looks behind them, but when Gemma and Desmond turn to the shop entrance to see who he’s greeting, no one is there and the automatic doors are shut. “They’re popular cars down that way,” he says.




Before the crash, they’d had different ideas about their own resilience, and each other’s. Gemma would have self-assessed as constitutionally flimsy. She expected that any day and out of nowhere an infection would enter her bloodstream⁠—from a painless abscess or cutty sandals⁠—or that a rare and rapid condition might kick in, her Hegarty-Morelli Irish-Italian cells having at one another, and that would be that. A stray thought would snag on her sanity one dismal afternoon, unspooling her to the psychological equivalent of a flat line. To have survived the crash at all smacked of a cosmic accident. 

Whereas Desmond had notions about his own fortitude. Without a whiff of self-doubt, he’d approached her at a manuscript exhibit at La Biblioteca Accademica⁠—having ascertained by her open-toe shoes in March and the “Made in Ireland” tattoo on her heel that she was Irish, and, by the way her breath fogged up the display cabinets, that she understood Italian⁠—and asked, in that warm flat pint of a Westmeath brogue, “What brings you all the way over here, then? Right next to me?” Despite having no siblings, he identified as an “eldest child,” as opposed to anything “only,” and went at things with a sense of easy, natural-order leader-ship. After the accident, he’d carried her unfinished translations to her bedside, sure they would hasten her recovery. At first, she used the excuse of her ribs. Later, she confessed that she hadn’t been able to shake a feeling of arbitrariness about everything she’d been in the middle of and was supposed to take back up⁠—all the book deadlines were suddenly at a vast remove. Nothing seemed to belong to her, nor she to anything. Without a hint of alarm, Des assured her that she’d feel differently soon. “Just you wait,” he’d said, “until someone offers you considerable honor and great exposure in lieu of payment. You’ll be itching to get back to it.” 

Gemma is standing on one side of the white line, the driving instructor is on the other, and Desmond has one foot on either side of it, his stance ridiculously wide. They all have on sensible shoes and the optimistic layered clothing of late autumn. There is a light mist, which won’t build up into anything⁠—Desmond had studied the rain radar this morning, between chewing his knuckles and his honey nut cornflakes. 

Gemma makes eyes at her husband to pass her the keys, so they can get started. He is normally raring to see her learning, especially revising! Revising is normally an erogenous activity. When she’d suggested taking this lesson, he’d slid his hand across her lower back, his pinkie brushing the top of her crack as he complimented her initiative. But when she added that he, too, should be in the car, “for moral support,” the hand retracted⁠—confirming a suspicion she’s been trying to keep at bay. 

“Yeah,” Des says. “The aul Panda. You never see the like of them here. The nouveau riche don’t go in for them boxy cars,” he says, switching to a grammar he thinks of as native.

The driving instructor, perhaps wondering if there’d been a head injury, returns his gaze to Gemma: “And were ye hurt?”

“I was, yeah.” Gemma nods and, weirdly, finds it hard to stop nodding. The instructor joins in with the nodding … until there might as well be music … and then leads her⁠—by example⁠—to a stop. “It hit Des mentally.”

“Ah, it would.” The instructor doesn’t look directly at the victim, but raises his line of sight a little.

 Desmond, whose hands are deep inside the pockets of his fine wool slacks, rattles the keys. Then he drags his toes along a bump in the white line, where the paint had gone over a glob of old chewing gum, preserving the DNA of some littering gobshite. He is expected to weigh in on the accident. “You wouldn’t go back for seconds, d’you know?”

Seeing that he’s determined to be hopeless, Gemma tells the instructor in a voice betraying weariness: “So it’s just a case of building up confidence. I think.”

“Whose confidence?”  

Gemma gathers the lapels of her cardigan across her chest. “Well,” she says. Her husband scans the sky for rain clouds. He’d been adamant that they wait for a clear day, which, in this country, is the ultimate procrastination tactic. Lest Des feel a sudden drop or decide to go shopping in Lidl and leave them to it, she says: “You can never be too practiced.”

“You can’t.” Desmond is happy to peer-review this statement.

“And,” she returns, in her fashion, to the point about whose confidence, “I mean … even Dante got the willies.” 

This, now … this is a statement that’s harder to corroborate, but Desmond doesn’t dispute it, because it’s encouraging to hear Gem identify with a good poet.




Quite easily Gemma navigates the empty car park. The replacement vehicle is an automatic, leaving her basically nothing to do. Only when she exits does the instructor have cause to intervene⁠—reaching across and pulling the steering wheel toward him. “Left side of the road,” he says. Gemma laughs apologetically and tries vocalizing a smacked forehead, since her hands are tied up. She explains that Desmond’s been doing all the driving since they moved, but she used to drive daily in Italy.

“Is that so?”

Gemma doesn’t note the wariness in his voice, because her own words are repeating in her head: “since we moved” as opposed to “moved back.” Which would have made it sound like she and Des had been an item in Ireland originally. But they hadn’t been. They don’t actually know how to be in their country of origin together. They stand around their breakfast bar, swirling espressi. They squirm palely, unsexily on their oversoft mattress, both appalled by Ireland’s lack of bidets. They wear waterproofs in the rain, or carry umbrellas, which once prompted a passing car to roll down the window and shout: “Gay!” In an effort to retrieve a social life, they’ve been leaving jaunty voice memos for school-era friends, inviting them to hang out⁠—friends whose weddings they missed and whose children and health conditions they don’t know the names of. In the messages, Gemma hears her own accent separate out from her, like she’s been dubbed.

On Friday, they’d gone to the best restaurant in the county (something they’d planned for as soon as Gemma was able to belly laugh without wincing), but Desmond had shaken the bread basket on their table and commented: “These weren’t cut from the same baguette. This is the ends of other people’s breads.” The dismay in his voice stopped Gemma from finding it funny. 

Leaning into the middle of the back seat, Desmond wills his wife leftward. Why won’t your man comment on her positioning? he thinks. Just as well that she drove on the wrong side of the road one minute into the lesson, so he knows what they’re dealing with. She’ll admit it herself! Her nonchalance … her lack of ceremony, which is to say: a certain sloppiness. She only thought to tell him on their honeymoon that she’d once slept with her Italian cousin, which she’d thought was allowable because they were both female and they looked nothing alike. Dusting the frame of his Ph.D. certificate one day, she confessed she didn’t “actually technically have a degree,” because she’d declined a lecturer’s invite back to his for a nightcap, and then found it too awkward to request an extension on her final assignment. Her whole line of work, really, might be thought of as a rough operation: restating things in another language without the goal of word-for-word parity. It got her in trouble, frequently, with elderly Italian academics and literati. If they only knew she’d slipped a few lines of her own into her translation of an early twentieth-century Ligurian manuscript! Of course he loves her for it⁠—her spontaneity, the romanticism of her reckless abandon. But sloppiness has no place behind the wheel of a car.

“Turn left here,” the instructor says.

“This left?” she asks.

“Yes!” Desmond says.

Gemma checks her blind spot, which her husband is doing his best to photobomb. She sets the window wipers in motion before finding the indicator. 

“And what are you doing, Desmond?” the instructor asks.  

“What?” Des slides back into his seat so fast that the belt makes a zipping sound into the dispenser. 

“What do you do yourself?” 

“Oh. I’m a historian of ancient art and classical archaeology.” After saying this, he lets out a string of small burps. “Excuse me.”

Gemma would laugh except she knows he’s not great in the back seat. He really isn’t. And he can’t settle his belly by staring at the road ahead, because they’re stuck behind a huge articulated hauler, dry-icing them in rubble dust. “He teaches ancient classics at Maynooth,” she explains. 

“You’re a teacher?” the instructor asks Desmond, to distract him from his wife’s plans to overtake the hauler. 

Des swallows another burp. “Not much. Besides a few Ph.D.s. I’m researching.”

“God, this fella!” Gemma says.

“Don’t overtake!” Desmond says.

“Second exit at the roundabout, please.” The instructor interlaces his fingers on his lap. The glide of his skin is dry and stiff as gardening gloves in the morning. 

When the hauler takes the first exit, Desmond nominally relaxes, like a rock that’s been fracked. Gemma spritzes the windscreen and their surroundings resolve. Flat pastureland. Nude trees like shadow puppets against the low-lying sky. Oversize boom-era housing in the distance; out of sniffing range of the road but not the silage.

“Hibernia, is it?” The instructor glances back to Desmond. “If it’s ancient Ireland you’re researching.”

Desmond watches cars change lanes like they’re wrecking balls with too much slack. “It isn’t,” he says. “It’s Herculaneum.”

The mist has a brown quality. Gemma is glad for the sound of the wipers breaking up the silence that follows Desmond’s answer. She mutters an apology. “He’d normally jump at the chance to explain⁠—”

“I’m concentrating,” Des says. “Sorry I can’t multitask!”

“Your concentration is distracting me,” says Gemma.

The instructor takes an audible breath before saying that, unfortunately, the road won’t improve in quality for the extra concentration. They cover a few hundred meters in the wake of this statement, neither understanding nor questioning it. The instructor voices the word Herculaneum, lingering on its final, calming syllable. 

“It’s a town near Pompeii.” Gemma feels a twinge in her neck and massages it.

“I’ll tell him, Gemma. You drive.”

“I know it,” the instructor says, but neither Gemma nor Desmond hears him. 

“Am I not driving?” Something about being in this country is exaggerating a weird sibling dynamic between them.

“The speed limit’s sixty here. You’re touching seventy,” the instructor says. 

“Sorry.” Gemma lowers her speed before checking the rearview mirror to say: “Go on, so! Tell him.” 

Desmond studies the pink patch on his wife’s neck⁠—which she’d taken her hand off the wheel to massage⁠—and waits for the skin to return to how it was. He still looks for fragments of the accident, the blue glass that freckled her for so long after.

“It’s an ancient Roman resort on the bay of Naples that was buried in pyroclastic material along with Pompeii in A.D. 79.” Desmond says this in one breath, as if briefing a paramedic on a medical history. “Because it was buried so deeply, it wasn’t discovered until the eighteenth century, and three-quarters of it is still unexcavated. Are we staying on this road to Naas, or … ?”

 The instructor looks out the passenger window at length, with demonstrative trust in Gemma’s driving. “Sempre dritto,” he says, for “straight ahead.” “Isn’t that it? In Italian?”

“Bravo,” Gemma says. 

In the rearview mirror, Gemma sees her husband’s face hued gray by his phone. He’s checking where sempre dritto leads on Google Maps, scanning the next few minutes of their lives for junctions. That wanting to know had often inspired and even aroused her. But his wanting to know had lately tipped over into needing, his curiosity oxidizing into something altogether less shiny.

“Why didn’t they dig up the rest of it?” the instructor asks. 

The seat belt is cutting into Desmond’s pecs, so he tucks his thumb between the belt and his chest, feeling his heart thump horribly. “That’s a good question,” he says and looks out his window⁠—beyond the cars to the grid of fields, fertilized to highlighter yellows and greens like library books the undergrads have had their way with.  

Gemma goes to say something, but the instructor places his palm on the dashboard in a signal to let her husband take his time⁠—if she’s reading his signs correctly. She should probably ask him what the open circle with the red perimeter means. And what the red X on the white background means. When she’d asked Des on their way to the lesson, he’d said “Clearway,” but when she asked what clearway meant, he’d replied, “You’re the linguist!”

“Is that because it’s costly, to excavate it,” the instructor asks, “or is it political?” 

“It’s costly,” Des mutters into his fist. “And there’s no guarantee …” His elbow is resting on the sill, and he’s punching his mouth. He unkisses his knuckles to speak further. “But, you know. It’s hard to put a price on the story of how we got here. History preserved so well there’s rings on the finger bones and bread in the ovens. There’s wine racks and bedsteads and babies’ cots, and sewage.” 

And there it is. The rising agent. Reliably, he warms to his subject. 

“What could we learn from two-thousand-year-old sewage, you wonder?”

“Sewage?” the instructor repeats, sensing a line of defense in place. “Plenty, to be sure. Plenty.”

Good man, Gemma thinks. 

“There’s a library belonging to Caesar’s father-in-law down there. The only complete library from antiquity in existence … and two whole layers of it are buried, totally unexplored. Hundreds of scrolls. Maybe thousands. Philosophers from the year fifty that we’ve never read or heard of. Myths we can’t even imagine.”  

The instructor pats his pocket, as if for keys. “And are they legible, the books?”

For no good reason, Gemma tries out the limit button on the steering wheel and the car heaves to a slower pace. “No,” she says. She presses the button again and accelerates. “Sorry.”

“Not yet,” Desmond says, tightly. “But we’re on the brink. There’s a fella at the University of Kentucky blasting the scrolls with powerful X-rays that make the lead in the ink fluoresce … You see, you’ve to scan the scrolls without unrolling them. If you unroll them, they disintegrate. We learned that in the eighteenth century, when an Italian priest invented an unrolling machine. And, by the way, he wasn’t the only one to destroy them by the hundreds. They were taken for chunks of coal in the first excavations and a bunch of muppets ignited them as flares to light a way through the wreckage.” 

“All some people have,” Gemma says, “is the little tunnel ahead of them. If they need to light it, they need to light it.” Neither of the men respond to this, or acknowledge having heard it. A blue sign comes visible through the mist, and at the next roundabout, instead of carrying on straight through to Naas town center, Gemma takes the first left⁠—slipping onto the motorway.




Des is explaining how Pompeii was easier dug up, because it was buried in only six meters of ash to Herculaneum’s twenty-five. He’s not quite at the spittle level of zeal, but he’s straining against his seat belt. Vesuvius is decades overdue, he’s explaining, “and the Campi Flegrei west of Naples … There’s been thousands of tremors this year! If one goes, the other goes. And if we can’t justify the cost of excavation now … what are the chances after another eruption?”

“That’s tough,” the instructor says.

“What?”

“That’s very tough.” The instructor begins to look around him, casting Gemma a quick glance. He’s twirling his wedding band, but his knuckles are enlarged by arthritis, so the ring will remain on his finger bone. 

Good, Gemma thinks, when the instructor lays down another question. With all the talk of ash, Des hasn’t yet understood that they’re on the motorway. The M7. On all sides, the landscape is being eclipsed⁠—the dirty white-curtain tarps of the lorry trailers subbing in for the sky.

“Being this close to a technological solution,” Desmond says. “This close to saving so much, if we could just extract them now, and hold on to them for another few years …” 

He’s wrong, Gemma thinks. It’s not all simply there, ready to be returned to its former glory, if only there were the funds: there’s a new town built on top of it! A living history, replete with underfunded care homes and universities and libraries, and untranslated magnum opuses. 

It is tunnel-dark, suddenly, between the looming vehicles, and Gemma wonders if there isn’t a downward slope to the motorway. To the right, a crack of sky moons into view where one of the trucks struggles to keep pace in the fast lane. He should be here and she should be there, but she can’t overtake from the center lane. She hits the indicator to slip in behind and tailgate him until he moves, but a warning beep signals the presence of obstacles. A besuited Dublin commuter in a BMW, getting ahead of the Monday-morning traffic. Desmond keeps medicinally talking to the instructor, who nods his reasonably priced nod. 

By the time Gemma has completed her maneuvers and relaxed into the fast lane, Desmond has moved forward in his seat. “It took years to get to her level!” He’s now leaning so far forward it’s all the instructor can do not to proffer his cheek for a kiss. “She even speaks dialects! How many, Gem? Romanesco and Genoese anyway. And to be able to capture the register and tone of turn-of-the-century Italian! There’s basically no one else⁠⁠—”

Perhaps because this case requires the driving instructor’s ear as much as his eye, he fails to notice a blue Subaru Impreza entering the slipway. The car, practically sparking off the ground with the weight of nonsense modifications and five young men, tears a diagonal line across the motorway’s three lanes; Gemma has to swerve within grazing distance of the concrete barrier down the middle so as not to be clipped. Steer in the direction of the skid, her father had once told her in the Alps, but she can’t do that, because of the barrier! 

For an instant, Gemma feels there’s something she’s forgotten to do. Something big, surely. But as the tires lose traction, she can think only of a sonnet’s closing couplet: the sonnet she’d been struggling to translate on the day they crashed. They are briefly loosed from the road’s surface, as if gravity is glitching. If she lets go of the current enjambment, loaded with implication as it is, that would make way for a masculine rhyme: a much stronger ending. She relaxes her grip on the wheel to ease their fishtailing. It’s not a very good sonnet⁠—it involves a polar bear (an animal the poet has clearly observed only in pixelated form) as well as the phrase a lick of flame, which the poet sort of invented in Italian without knowing it to be a cliché in English, so not an especially proud ending, but …

“Well done,” the instructor says, once Gemma has restabilized the car. During the skid, the driving instructor’s hands had never left his lap, but now he unzips his anorak pocket and extracts a book and his phone.

“For actual fuck’s saaaaake!” Gemma says belatedly.

“Pull over,” Desmond says.

“You did well,” the instructor says, zooming his phone’s camera in on the license plate while it’s legible. “They’d only love to claim a rear-ending.”

“Stop the car!” 

The driving instructor’s hand hovers over the hazard button, and he glances back at Desmond, then checks his blind spot to guide her, if need be, into the hard shoulder. 

“Pull over, Gemma!” Desmond’s voice sounds rigid and penal, only without the promise of all that. Gemma takes a deep breath, holds it for a moment, and then asks the driving instructor what he’s reading. 

“Gemma!” 

Propping his book and phone on his lap, the instructor says: “Just there, it’s safe as it’ll get to pull in.” 

“If you don’t pull over⁠—” Desmond says. 

“We’ll be good and visible.”

“⁠—I’m jumping out.” 

“Jesus, Desmond!” Gemma hits the indicator, checks her blind spot, pulls over at speed, and hand brakes a split second early. “Here you go,” she says. “You’re in the emergency lane. Waiting for an emergency. Are you comfy?”

In the back seat, Desmond is tucked into a brace position. There’s a long, breathless silence until Gemma hits the hazard button. The weather ahead vacillates in the blinking lights. “You do remember,” she goes on, her voice hardened, “that I’m not the one who was driving?”

She catches the driving instructor’s “Say again?” expression. So the answering machine had cut her off. 

“We’ll give it a minute,” the instructor says. “Let them desperados get to the end of the road.” He again compliments Gemma’s handling of “those bowseys” and offers the assessment that she has buckets of confidence. “I see no real problem.” He repeats this at full volume. More softly, he adds that she might look over the Rules of the Road manual … just to familiarize herself with the Irish side of things. “And never drive so close to a car you can’t see its taillights. Not even in a queue of traffic. Besides that,” he says, and doesn’t complete the sentence. They are housed within the static of thickening rain. Two green arrows on the dashboard blink in opposite directions. A high wooden fence to their left deprives them of a vista. Every time a vehicle passes, the car wobbles and droplets on the windows couple up. The instructor says they’re in no rush. 

“War and Peace?” Gemma says, glancing down at the coverless book on his lap.

“Oh.” The instructor does a nod in reverse, where his chin goes up and then falls. “It’s just … a bit of it. The whole book wouldn’t fit in my pocket.” 

“Who’s the translator?” Gemma asks, frowning. 

Desmond unclips his seat belt, slides to the inside door, and tries the handle. “Can you please turn off the child lock please.”

Gemma twists painfully around, but Desmond won’t meet her eye. Bewildered almost to the point of laughter, she presses an adventure of buttons on the dashboard, including the icon of an entombed child. 

“You’re safer inside the car than out of it,” the instructor says, but Desmond has already opened the door straight into the metal barrier. There’s no space to squeeze out, so he slams the now-dented door shut again and lowers the window.

“It does have fancy safety features,” Gemma admits. “If he’d been driving this car for the crash, I’d probably only have … realigned my chakras.” 

From the lowered window, fresh benzene wafts in. 

“It might have been too much,” the driving instructor says, “the motorway. Just yet.” His eyes settle on Gemma. Is she being scolded for having taken them on the motorway? Or for having outed her husband as the one in need of a lesson? Given that he’s exiting via the window, headfirst, she’s inclined to agree. 

“Sorry,” she says. She considers the clean soles of Desmond’s ankle boots as they withdraw through the window. Some gymnastics are involved⁠—it’s the opposite of an Irish exit, really⁠—but he seems relatively uninjured as he hops the barrier. 

“If you’re happy enough,” the instructor says, “I can drive us back. Once he’s …”

Gemma watches her husband pacing the strip of grass with his hands laced behind his head and his face angled to the sky, as if a sneeze is eluding him or he’s blanking on the capital of Upper Mesopotamia. She doesn’t speak this dialect of her husband’s body language, or much like it. 

The instructor closes the air vents within reach. “Believe it or not,” he says, “car fumes suppress the nervous system. They can give you a calm, euphoric feeling. In the long term, they’re lethal. But for the morning that’s in it, they’ll do him no harm.”

They wait and Gemma watches her husband come to a stop, his back to them. His head is bowed and she watches his shoulders for trembling. Instead, he drops onto his haunches and begins to uproot a huge creeping thistle. He has to pause midway through to nurse his hands.

Oh, Desmond Desmond Desmond. What does he need her to do? Tell him it wasn’t his fault? But the police report said as much, in plain English. He’d been driving like a grown man recently struck by his father. That morning, his father had sprung at him but had been too out of sync with himself to land the punch. “It happens,” the nurse said mildly, as if referring to matters of the toilet. It happens? Desmond repeated to Gemma in the corridor. That someone who’s always loved you, pretty well without pause, suddenly and certainly ends their subscription? 

It does happen. You look at a person you’ve known and who has known you⁠—a person with whom you’ve shared an understanding beyond language, a person whose smell comes out of your own pores⁠—and you want to protect your memories with them. Which is to say, you have no mind to add new ones.

When Desmond drops the weed and tilts his face up to the unforecast rain, Gemma sees his crown of thinning hair⁠—the heritable trait he was most afraid of, once. She takes a deep breath and, as she does so, realizes it’s her first in months; until recently, breathing into her chest had made her grimace, which made Des sulk. But pain is unavoidable, she sees that now.

Even as she reaches her decision, she searches for a way to soften it. To allow for multiple interpretations. Before the accident, she’d been talking about brushing up her Latin. Her Italian needs a better connection to its point of origin, she can say⁠—an argument that might even humble him. A monastery stay in Brescia. Something immersive. Solo. He’ll have those exams to preside over, so many theses to supervise … That guy in Kentucky has launched a million-dollar competition to accelerate efforts to decode the Herculaneum papyri, which Desmond’s students really should enter. And, of course, there’ll be brownie points with his family if he joins them for Christmas in Westmeath⁠—and she with hers in the Alps. And who can say when Christmas really ends? In Italy, it practically spills into Easter. And into Ascension Day, Lo Sposalizio del Mare, when the tradition is to throw a golden ring into the sea. The other ring, the diamond one, she’ll sell for a Vespa. 

The road is clear when she opens the door to go and say what he needs to hear, for now. The rain sounds of an old film, by all accounts good.




They’re foreign, all right⁠—thinks the driving instructor⁠—as the fella buries his face into the missus. She seems to let him. The instructor opens his book to give them some privacy. As much privacy as can be granted in a billboard’s position on the M7 eastbound. 

He rereads a line of the Tolstoy, where he’d left off: “We love people not so much for the good they’ve done us, as for the good we’ve done them.” 

That would have you thinking, so it would. He twitches to underline it. It sounds true … but … No. It doesn’t hold up, for himself. He dog-ears the page, though. He’ll come back to it. He clocks them, still at it. When, a moment ago, she’d seemed fit to strike him. That sort of volatile, theatrical love is popular on the continent. Italy’s famous for it. And the Greeks! Holy God, the ancient Greeks. Hadn’t he gone there on his own honeymoon? In his fifties, mind you. So not a million years ago. Claire’s clot had developed on the flight. Driving gives him a lot of time to reminisce about the woman he’ll be stuck in the honeymoon phase with for the rest of his life. They never got to fighting in a hard shoulder.

This isn’t his favorite place in the world to be, truth be told. You could always get one lorry behind another lorry that doesn’t spot you and comes in lazy over the line. Since the pair seem to have reconciled, he lowers the window and suggests that the two of them hop in the back via the roadside. “When it’s good and clear,” he calls out. “There’s no getting in this side.” He unclips his seat belt. “I’ll shift over to the driver’s seat from here.” 

But before he has a chance to move a muscle Desmond has hopped the barrier, run around the front of the car, and opened the roadside door to occupy the driver’s seat. He’s reaching for the seat belt as if preparing for a javelin throw. Rain pours off him. 

Gemma has slipped into the back. The instructor can see her leaning forward⁠—with a flightier energy to what she had before⁠—as her husband puts the car into drive and lowers the hand brake.

“Hold it a minute⁠—” the instructor says. 

“He has a license,” Gemma assures him, with wide, maniac eyes.

“I have to tell ye⁠—” the instructor says. “Given the circumstances⁠—”

“Don’t forget your seat belt,” the woman says. “Not that you’ll need it.”

The indicator begins to tick. The road’s surface is rippling with rain. The wipers blink red taillights in and out of focus. The instructor looks to the hand brake, but the man has a hold of it like it’s a rein and this is a rodeo. His other hand has the wheel at twelve o’clock. 

“Read me out a bit of War and Peace,” the woman interjects, in a nurse-y voice. “Would you? Read me your favorite passage. We can get a fix on the translator, and decide if they were any use at all.”

The windows have fogged up unevenly. The driving instructor pulls at the zip of his anorak. Feels the heft of the book on his knee, a fair whack of it anyways. Regardless of whether he’s done these people any good … he doesn’t love them. God forgive him. He doesn’t love them enough."

    "text": "The talk of trying them, of there being nothing else to do, of the possibility, however small, of finding a new kind of purpose⁠—thinking outside the box⁠—was mitigated by concern about epic bad trips or just plain death after what had happened to Amy, though that was more of a broken-leg issue. The AI medical wellness suite being not quite state-of-the-art, and there being the possibility that no one really wanted to explore of some kind of mismanagement of medication. Its being unclear, none of them having trained in medicine, what exactly it was that had caused Amy’s passing. John seemed to argue that death might not be so bad under the circumstances, though it was of course difficult to understand him, as he spoke through tears. Still. There was a certain, let’s say, carefulness around drugs among the remaining members of the judiciary and their support staff⁠—Terry and Keith⁠—who were great, of course. 

They took it to a vote and agreed eight to two that anybody who wanted to was free to go ahead and “sample the wares.” Brett immediately raised a hand. Clarence looked around at the others, murmured that he was surprised, and extended a hand as well. And then, well, then that was it. The other justices sat there blinking until Sonia said, “Okay, what do we do now?” and Samuel said, “I guess they take the drugs. The acid or whatever.” And Clarence and Brett dropped, and then somebody suggested Bear Paw.

They were in the smaller, formal mess⁠—far enough off the main grid that you could forget for a second that you were living at the end of eight miles of tunnels, inside a mountain, between concrete walls, under lead-lined ceilings, the crystal chandeliers an afterthought of some unchained military planner in a former world. (Sigh.) It had a Persian rug, recessed lighting, one long table, and nine leather chairs. The tenth chair had been dragged in from the regular mess, and was not very comfortable. For that reason, Brett or Sonia always made a point of taking it, not wanting to allow some situation to develop where it was always Terry or Keith in the bad chair. 

They sat with two pouches of Scrabble tiles and half a dozen bottles of Brett’s home-brewed beer, a wheat gruit that was really more like hard kombucha. You had to drink quite a lot of it before you maybe felt a little hot in the face or sore in the shoulder joints. The game had originally involved recalling obscure precedents, trying to stump one another, but over time its rules had evolved into a tangle of codicils and caveats that would likely be indecipherable to an outsider, had there been one. The suspicion that a justice was fabricating precedents had given way to one’s own fabrications, subtle at first, then large, graphic, designed as provocation. These fictions had evolved into indirect personal attacks, and Bear Paw, as it was played now, was really a game of insulting people.

One thing: Brett was not a wreck like John, but he did feel penetrated by sadness. That was pretty much to be expected, but it was a little unfamiliar to him. Not unfamiliar. It was something, in a former life, that he had kept at bay with work, family. Maybe only sometimes brushing the depths when he got really wasted. Hammered. A memory came to mind, of the time he attacked a car.

“Brett?” Sonia said. “We’re doing alphabetical order by first name, so that leaves it with you.”

“Oh, of course, yes. Sorry about that. All right.” He drummed his fingers on the table and looked around ominously. “An easy one to start … Uh … Let me see. Okay, I know. ‘Where First Amendment rights are asserted to bar governmental interrogation, resolution of the issue always involves a balancing by the courts of the competing private and public interests at stake in the particular⁠—’ ”

“Barenblatt v. United States, 1959.” Clarence snapped up two tiles from Brett’s pile. “Way too easy. Upholding the conviction of …” He paused, pretended to contemplate how to lay out his new tiles among his old. 

“Lloyd Barenblatt,” Brett said. “A graduate student and teaching fellow who refused to⁠—”

“Right, right.” Clarence raised a hand irritably. “Sure. Now.” He looked around the table. “How about something that is actually obscure? No offense, Brett.” He began to quote at length from a state appellate ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony on bloodstain pattern analysis.

While he droned on about serology and forensics, Brett looked down at his hands on the table. They seemed brighter than usual. He did not think they were ordinarily so luminescent. 

“Wait a minute,” Samuel said. “I know this one. It’s State v. Goode.” 

He took two of Clarence’s tiles and quoted some tax compliance law, which Sonia recognized. She drew two from Samuel’s tiles and quoted from a civil case that clarified the standards for awarding attorneys’ fees. Elena identified that, and brought up a Supreme Court case addressing zoning violations and First Amendment challenges, which Ketanji knew. In short, it was a great big snoozefest of actual case law until finally Brett caught Neil’s winding allusions to Stambovsky v. Ackley, thank God, and was able to move things along to the insult portion of the evening. 

The question was only whom. He looked away from John, who needed a tissue. Sonia smiled in encouragement, communicating that it would be fine if he went after her. He tried to think of something negative to say, but his mind went blank. He could mention those séances at her grandmother’s. It was toothless, and the game would go on. Ordinarily he would have gone that way, but at the last minute his eyes fell on Clarence, who sat in his J-71 Bentley & Simon robe. The other justices had put away their robes hours after their arrival at Mount Jack, but Clarence “liked to keep up the formalities.” 

“We’d catch fiddler crabs,” Brett said. “Roast them over a fire. Five years old and poor as the day is long, but we ate better than Gwyneth Paltrow.”

Several of his colleagues laughed.

“Okay,” Clarence said. 

Brett shrugged. 

“How’s that an insult?”

Brett reached into the sack of tiles for a few more letters.

“I don’t get it,” Clarence said. “Anybody else confused by that one? Is the joke that I was poor? Or something about Gwyneth Paltrow?”

“She’s an exhibitionist,” Ketanji said.

“Well, with that body,” Sonia said.

“Right, but not an exhibitionist like that. Like, it was a problem. For a while in the nineties she was coming to the door naked a lot, for deliveries and stuff.”

Clarence raised his eyebrows. Ketanji had him distracted. She was clever, in addition to being, Brett was noticing more and more, actually pretty hot.

“It was a thing with her,” Ketanji said. “Like, picking up Chinese takeout naked at her front door after dark, to say she was so powerful she didn’t have to put her clothes on for anybody. Her assistant said it was just constantly going on.”

Clarence hesitated, torn by warring instincts⁠—wanting, on the one hand, to continue a conversation about nudity with the most attractive woman in the bunker, and, on the other hand, to verbally dominate Brett (giving up or ignoring an argument being the same as losing it). “But back to Brett’s thing,” he said. “It’s just that I don’t understand. What are you saying?”

Brett sat up. “All right.” He took a long draft of his gruit and squared his shoulders. He was not a fighter. He was, let’s face it, more of a lover, but when pressed, he would indeed defend himself. “You say you caught crawfish when you were five, and then cooked them over a fire and ate them? That sounds about … He couldn’t find the word. This happened more and more to all of the justices. (And staff, who were really doing top-notch work.) They thought the word-loss might be related to aging, or lack of stimulation. There was a gentle way to put what he wanted to say to Clarence, but Brett couldn’t find the word. 

Clarence raised his eyebrows. “Yes?”

Brett gave up on finding the gentle word and said, “It sounds like a lie.”

“Oh, I see.” Clarence was wounded. He frowned and looked at his tiles.

“I’m sorry,” Brett said. “I can see I hit a nerve. That wasn’t my intention. I apologize.” 

“What? Oh, sure. Sure … It’s a game, after all.” Clarence smiled weakly.

Brett felt awkward in the silence and stood. “I’m going to go down for a few more bottles of gruit. Can I get anybody anything while I’m up?”

“Maybe something to snack on?” Sonia said.

“I just want things to go back the way they were,” John said.

Brett nodded, looking down for a moment to indicate respect. A pale blue light circled in the center of his vision, and he was having an auditory hallucination of a symphony he was reasonably sure he had never heard before. Amazing stuff, brains. When he felt that sufficient time had passed, he looked up and clapped his hands. “So … grub. Clarence, how about you, bud?”

“No, Brett. Thank you. I’m just fine. I still have plenty of gruit.” Clarence gestured toward his glass.

Brett patted John’s shoulder and looked at Sonia. “You said you wanted something to snack on. Maybe let’s get a little more specific. What are we thinking sounds good?”

“I don’t know. Something salty and crunchy.”

“Salty and crunchy, got it. Anything else? Neil?”

“Just take another gruit, thanks.”

“A man goes against his primary instincts to share something about his past,” Clarence said. “He ignores the mean thing inside himself that warns against a proactive share, that says, Reactive at most, and in response, he is ridiculed. Called a liar.”

Brett clapped his hands together. “Okay. I’m going to, uh …” He turned and walked toward the open door that led into the large industrial passageway.  

“What’s the difference between a proactive and a reactive share?” he heard Ketanji say. She was so clever. Really just, like, unusually.

 “I suppose it’s just zeitgeist-y language, from when there was such a thing,” Clarence said. “The proactive being an overture, the reactive being a reassurance of overture accepted.”

Their voices faded. Brett flicked on the fluorescent overheads. The kitchen was mostly well kept, if not as orderly as it had been before the bunker ranks had thinned. The Cambro containers had mismatched lids, the smells of past meals lingered. A cutting board and a chef’s knife had been left out on the prep table next to an old wheel of cheese, and dozens of wet bar mops had been hung to dry over the edge of the three-compartment sink. Thinking that he would definitely say something at the next candle meeting, he let himself into the pantry. 

He walked past the spices and canned goods to the stainless-steel shelving units lined with white three-gallon buckets. He pried off a lid: flour. He tried to get the lid back on, but the maneuver eluded him in the moment, fine motor being a bit reduced by LSD and gruit. He set the bucket on the floor for someone else to deal with and pulled the lids off a few more buckets at random⁠—oats. More oats. “God, to one day open one of these and find hops,” he murmured. “Just one time let me find a bucket of glorious hops.” Basmati, pasta, cornmeal. More oats. He left the open buckets on the floor of the pantry, tried a few more, and finally hit pay dirt: a sack of pretzels. 

He went down the pantry stairs to the brewery, as he called it, a dark little subbasement room where he had been brewing wheat beer since they’d drunk through what they could find of the bunker’s liquor supply, maybe about a year back. He was afraid of the dark. As he reached for the light switch, his mind filled with horror. Images of horror. He flicked the lights. 

The air filtration grate in the brewery was covered in dust. He contemplated finding a bar mop and wiping the unit down. He would speak to Terry. Had to find a way to put it, roundabout. Horror. Images of horror. Smoke shot into the air, capped by a little hat. Michael Myers, that guy from Halloween. He took a deep breath, counted back from five, then bent to retrieve some bottles.

When he rejoined the group, Clarence was fully restored, in the middle of holding forth about his butt, or something. Brett set the brews down, then slipped the pretzels next to Sonia. She gasped and took a handful, then turned and apologized to Clarence. 

“That’s all right, Sonia. Pass me a couple of those, would you?” Clarence extended a hand and accepted some pretzels, then looked at them while he spoke. Brett felt a strange, juvenile giddiness welling up in him, like he wanted to laugh and make a hoo-hoo-hoo sound. 

Sonia mouthed the words “Thank you” to Brett.

“I thought it was broken for a while,” Clarence said. “For like a day.” 

Brett cracked open a bottle. It foamed over and he sipped the overflow, shrugging, then began to pour. “My lady,” he said, handing a barnyard-motif crystal double old-fashioned glass of gruit to Ketanji, who was, he was beginning to see and feel more strongly, most definitely a Crystal Palace nine. Maybe even a nine point five.

“I thought I was dribbling poop for about a day,” Clarence said, leaning back in his chair. “Every time I went to the bathroom, brown stripe. I thought, Well, fuck⁠—thank you, Brett, as I said, I have plenty of gruit⁠—I thought, I’m anally incontinent now, too, in addition to having to rub ointment on my you-know-what nightly, my anal fissure, or whatever. And I pray on my knees, Let it heal before I go through the tube.”

“Jesus.” Brett handed Clarence’s glass to Elena, whom, frankly, he would also hit, then strategically served Keith and Terry, so as not to suggest that they were in any way less than, before turning to John and Neil and the remaining members of the court.

“I was going in for the thorough wipes on the asshole, but kept missing the side, where there was this tiny pocket of shit. Brett, am I going into too much detail?” 

“I mean, there’s no ‘hate speech’ exception to the First Amendment … but at the table, I believe there’s a certain expectation of …”

“Oh, I apologize. As much as I dislike the left and all their talk of consent, I do think of it as an important part of the deed that I get the go-ahead.”

Brett didn’t care for that. He sat and frowned, focused on the particular site of his rage, something a little less than an itch, just below the throat. He could bear that. 

“I won’t just push you all into the figurative spare bedroom,” Clarence said, rocking back in his chair. “Try to get off your swimsuit while a friend of mine jumps up and down on the bed, laughing like a jackal.”

 “Are we talking about something in particular?” Brett said. 

Clarence met his eye and Brett felt his chin duck, his face do the ingratiating smile. In high school, some of the guys had started a thing where they said “Shit-eating grin” to the tune of “Sweet Child O’ Mine” when he did it. Worse now that his teeth were a little yellowish. It was all the Coca-Cola that got him. When he pulled all-nighters, all the way through high school and college and even at law school, he treated himself to a two-liter bottle. He was a grinder, and his teeth reflected that.

Clarence lowered his chair legs back to the ground. 

“If you want to talk about something, let’s talk about it,” Brett said. “Let’s talk about sexual stuff. Let’s do an accounting, a who’s who of …” 

Clarence looked at the others. “I feel like I might be missing something.”

“Had it happened,” Brett said. He realized he was speaking with his voice raised. He liked it. He liked the sound of himself when he was angry. He didn’t lower it, his raised voice. He kept it right where it was. He said, “Had it have happened, which it did not, but were it the case that such a thing had happened, between myself and, you know, I would have been a child playing grab-ass at a party. While I was drunk. A kid, in a culture that fed me that sort of thing. Porky’s, and whatnot. A boy, entering⁠—and, I remind you, nothing happened. Exactly nothing, is what happened. It went as far as that, as far as⁠—oh, I’ll grant you too far⁠—but as far as it went is as far as it … You, on the other hand, Clarence, were an adult, in a position at the time, with the … whatchamacallit … With an ongoing history of behavior. You were in charge of the office of whatever.”

“Ah.” Clarence tilted his head back slightly. “Brett, I apologize. I honestly did not intend to open this discussion. I am at a point in my life …” He gestured around at the bunker. “I’m at a point in my life where I honestly don’t even think of our confirmation hearings.”

“Oh, don’t give me that.”

“I’m telling you the truth,” Clarence said. “If anything, I look back on the past, when we were all so consumed with these smaller questions as the world burned around us, and I wish it could be done over. We were so sensitive, losing our minds if someone cut us off on the freeway, then calling it road rage. Actually so arrogant that we regarded our weariness, weakness, worn-down fragility as rage.”

“Please,” Brett said. “How long are you going to wear that cloak?” 

He could feel that the remark had not sat well with the others. Outright hostility. The importance, when living inside a mountain, of harmony.

“Leaving on the cloak,” Clarence said gently. “Shall we continue our game?”

He opened the second drawstring bag of tiles and glanced at Brett. This was the moment when the physical and emotional alignment of the two semidisgraced judiciaries caused a metaphysical click. Fueled by raw emotion and perhaps radiation-induced biological changes, and of course they’d just dropped acid, so … for one reason and another, the two men were able to speak telepathically⁠—to “read each other’s minds.”

“Are we dealing them out or what?” Clarence said. And then he repeated the question mentally a few times, concurrent with a few bars of Horn Concerto no. 4.

 “Just dump them,” Brett thought.

Clarence nodded and flipped the bag over, making a pile in the middle of the table, and then the two men glanced up at each other, asking the same question at once. To which both men thought some version of, “I can hear you. Can you hear me?”

Clarence was the first to come back to himself. He addressed the others at the table. “Can you all hear us, too?” he asked. 

Sonia held a hand to her mouth, which was full of pretzels. “We hear you, Clarence,” she said. 

“Okay, bitch,” Brett thought. “Do you hear me now.” He cringed, worried about how Clarence would take that, but Clarence lifted his glass and sipped some gruit, apparently pleased. 

And by the way: Nothing. Static from the rest of the judiciary and support staff. No answer, no physical acknowledgment of having heard Brett call his distinguished colleague a b-word on the mental plane. 

“I think it’s just you and me,” Brett thought.

Clarence looked at Brett and raised his eyebrows. “Raise two fingers in the air,” he thought. Brett did the peace sign with both hands, then recognized his mistake and lowered one hand, unconsciously cringing in embarrassment, a habit of his he didn’t like. 

“Everybody grab four,” Clarence said. 

The justices pulled their tiles. Neil immediately became docile, and Brett knew he was holding something. The others struggled to keep their expressions neutral, Samuel puffed up, clownishly trying to play someone with a good set of letters. Clarence took eight tiles and passed four to John, who was, it goes without saying, weeping. 

Ketanji took four tiles and blinked. She looked up, her eyes focused, revealing nothing about what she held. 

Clarence thought, “Look at those eyes.”

Brett glanced up at Ketanji. He liked the shape of her eyes, but even more, he liked what was behind them. 

“Clarence,” Brett said. “Aren’t you going to look at your tiles?”

Clarence did, radioing his hand to Brett in that instant⁠—ha ha⁠—and Brett began to laugh hysterically, hyena-ish-ly. The other justices watched, confused, as Clarence pantomimed that he “did not understand.”

“Oh, sure, sure,” Brett said. “Play that game.” He pointed back and forth between Clarence’s temple and his own. “Ah? Ah?” Actually, he was starting to feel strange. He was feeling speedy and unnatural, seeing patterns and tracers, messages in the occasional filtration-unit gusts.

Clarence was still pretending to be perplexed. “I think it’s with Neil,” he said. 

 “It’s Neil.”

“Okay,” Neil said. “You two are going to …” He trailed off, obviously looking for the words do me like that. He looked at Clarence, then back at his tiles. He blushed and sat up straight, glanced once again at Clarence, and began to quote guidelines for radiation-sickness claims.

“This motherfucker,” Clarence thought. “Reciting from Three Mile Island, trying to insult me for telling an amusing story about my ass.”

“Right,” Brett thought. “TMI.”

“Like I’m unaware. Like I’m telling the story about walking around with a pocket of stuff hiding in my swimsuit area, not knowing it’s more information than Neil would provide.”

Brett shrugged. “You going to identify the case?”

“Let’s see if somebody else gets it.”

Honestly? The telepathy didn’t come as a surprise. Brett had often suspected that he was just a moment’s darting thought away from walking through walls. He had even tried it one night, pressing his hand against the wall beside his bed, but it had just done the ordinary thing. Hand to wall, resistance. “The usual,” as he had liked to say at the Brickskeller, meaning by that, at the time, Whatever’s new and interesting on tap.

“In re TMI,” Clarence grumbled. “Not exactly obscure.” Verbally, he began to rattle off some intricate case law that alluded to the omissions in Neil’s last book, but on the mental plane, his thoughts turned to Anita. 

“Would it surprise you, Brett, to know that I had no sexual feeling of any kind for her?” Clarence thought. “Not at first.”

Brett felt the sadness circling somewhere around his nose and mouth. 

“You want to talk about love,” Clarence thought. “I was a person forever in love, forever unrequited. Jacking off to memories of glances. The ones I thought were my big loves at the time? In retrospect I can see they were just an elaborate form of striving. Wanting to be in an imagined social place, feeling an imagined way. That’s romantic love, at least for this young man. Of course, none of that’s calculated. It’s all very innocent, very visual. So for me it culminated in what? The bitch. I liked bitches. Anita is many things, but a bitch? She’s a country mouse. A hayseed. No, thank you. Give me the corporate bitch. The eighties bitch. Armani suit, shoulder pads. No waist. Hair like a helmet. All this was unknown to me at the time, of course. Anita was not a romantic … what. One thing I don’t like in bed is so-called innocence. I don’t like people who can’t admit to the filth of the world. Anita and I, from the very start, we did not like each other. You want to ask, why did I hire her? I’ll tell you why: she was the most qualified candidate for the job. ’Course, what I didn’t know at the time was, she was a doodler. She was always drawing in her notebooks. I’d come in, she’d slip it under her blotter. Drew me once. I was expecting something with a receding hairline and a big set of Coke-bottle glasses, but it was an elaborate drawing of a brain with a dotted line passing through it. One side marked Exterior and the other one …” Clarence paused to remember the word. “Interior,” he thought after a few moments. “And a large marquee behind it that said PSYCHIC DISTURBANCES in capital letters. It seemed⁠—though I was not sure⁠—to suggest that I personally was the source of all human misery.” 

Brett laughed. Clarence had peculiar eye contact that made you feel like he was right there painfully with you in whatever it was that was going on. It was something about Clarence that people hadn’t realized, in another world: he was likable. 

“I could not be sure, because it had so much small writing, and when I started to read it I got nervous that she would think I was in love with her or something, like I give a shit, so I smiled and said she was a good artist and not to draw on government time in the future.”

Clarence thought about his radical-left days in school, when he’d worn a leather jacket and always had Malcolm X’s autobiography in his pocket. He told Brett, telepathically, about what he saw as the softness, the arrogance, the unexamined outright stupidity of that young man. He asked what was wrong, at the end of the day, with finding a path through the obstacles placed before him. Brett lowered his chin to conceal that he was beginning to tremble all over, and Clarence informed him that he still dreamed of Anita from time to time. 

Brett faded out for a while then. His body remained at the table with the judiciaries, pressing a forefinger into the corner of a Scrabble tile while looking at the beads of perspiration on his glass, but his mind sank down through the Persian rug and the Kevlar-reinforced concrete floor, past the crawl space to the thousands of springs screwed down into rock, and he thought about hair, all the time he had devoted to his hair, and his pride when law students mentioned that it was “great” on his faculty evaluations. He thought about how Terry was always putting his shirts in the wrong places, even sometimes confusing Elena’s white V-necks with his own, and at the same time as he envisioned the mismatched shirts and imagined saying something about it, he contemplated which Letterman he preferred⁠—the titan, aloof with ankle crossed at knee? Or the rheumy-eyed bearded man consumed by regret, feebly inserting himself into the conversation. And when he faded in again, Clarence was thinking about a couple of dates he’d had with a woman who was too tall for him, and how he’d had to go about trying to explain that he liked her but it wasn’t physically comfortable, and then that got him onto third man syndrome.

“A phenomenon known to occur during extreme wilderness hikes, survival situations. An arctic explorer named …” He paused, searching. “A mountain climber whose name I cannot quite remember at this moment reported it first. It’s the mind’s way of …” He waited. Words didn’t come to him as they once had. He blinked and thought, “Anita.” 

“What?” 

Clarence attempted to recross his legs, sliding off the chair and landing on the floor in the process. That the other justices were still involved with their game Brett was aware, but he could not quite recall what it was they were playing, and when he pressed himself, he had to admit he could not remember what it was, “to play a game.”

“You okay?” Clarence thought.

Brett was staring at the flag hanging in the corner of the officers’ mess. 

“Brett,” Clarence said. He rolled over, so he was face down on the floor. “Brett.” He extended a hand and took hold of the toe of Brett’s shoe. “Hey, Brett.”

“Jesus,” Brett thought, “give me a little space.” 

“I only asked how you were.”

“Look at me, man. I am in a fragile state,” Brett thought.

“No. It hasn’t hit, I don’t think. I don’t think it’s going to work.”

Brett laughed softly.

Clarence let go of his shoe. He thought, “Anita didn’t notice me the first time we met, even though she was sitting in my office. This was before I had that preppy style. We ran out of soda at the Christmas party a few months later, and the two of us went down to get more, and I tried to get her attention, saying ‘Night wood, night wood,’ but it was like I was invisible.” 

“Night wood, like … ?”

“When you wake up hard. I was just going through my first divorce. It was before we moved over to the EEOC. I was still living in the studio apartment papered with cutouts from pornographic magazines. George Benson’s ‘Greatest Love of All’ was my …” Clarence looked for the word.

Semiconsciously, Brett had a filmstrip thought of putting his penis into Debbie’s hand at a college party. “That’s not a real penis,” she said, believing that it was a dildo. He was drawn back by the recognition that Clarence must have “seen the footage.” He tried to explain. “It was not my finest moment,” he thought. “Not cool. Not cool. Of course, it was a different time. In ten years, we may look back and judge meat-eaters for, uh … you know, like … also, sort of give me a break?”

“Self-love is so important, Brett. And forgiveness. What I’m saying is, suddenly I had her undivided attention. She made midsentence acknowledgments of the ineffable. I got the shingles, and I let her touch the one that ran along my armpit. Told her that it felt like fire. At this time in my life, I didn’t expect, didn’t even think of it, when I’d just met a woman, if you can believe that.” 

“What?”

“To fall in love,” Clarence thought. “To fall in love. Anyway, I’m not sure why, but something weird came over me, where I felt I had to say something about this porno I saw. And that night, thinking about her face when I said what I said, I jacked it.” 

“I did that once,” Brett thought. “When I was an associate, with this paralegal. I picked her up and tried to carry her over the threshold of the Brickskeller, but somehow got the weight funny and dropped her on the sidewalk.”

“Came long, hard, and mystical. It made no sense. I chased her, talking crazy shit, eliciting at one point a genuine sit-down with her, where she came right out and said, ‘What’s happened to you?’ But it was too late. Tell you what: I’m the original edgelord. Know what else? That bitch loved to hear me talk dirty.”

“I jacked off to the thought of dropping her,” Brett thought. “I’m not really sure why. I still get hard about it. Maybe, like, the humiliation aspect?”

“Long Dong Silver. The Adventures of Bad Mama Jama. She loved⁠—not me. Bitch hated me. But she loved that pungent speech. We all do.”

Brett shook his head.

Clarence closed and opened his eyes. “Do you feel it?” he thought. Brett felt lightheaded. The generator coughed, and the recessed lighting flickered. He crossed his legs and wished the federal-blue wallpaper would not undulate softly. Maybe if he looked away from it, down at the oak table rippling under the tiles, reflecting his image back to him. He tentatively touched its surface, and his image fractured, distorted, and rippled outward. The humming of the generator seemed to be saying, “Brett.” He wondered if he could levitate.

“Me too,” Clarence thought. “We need to dim the lights. Get the full effect. Of the light show.” 

Brett looked at the wall, trying to determine if he could move his legs. He looked down at his thighs, triangular in khakis. His vision began to fade at the corners.

“At this time,” Clarence thought, “I actually regarded myself as a five-foot-nine-inch pile of human garbage.” 

He was still telling a story, but Brett was distracted by a recognition existing underneath the things he smelled, such as recycled air, old upholstery, paper. It was, he felt, important. Some flickering intelligence, but then it was gone. 

“She said I needed to get an ordinary apartment, that was my problem. We sent each other listings,” Clarence thought. “I found a renovated room in a cathedral. The floors were light oak, the ceiling twenty, thirty feet high, enormous windows bathing the space in soft light. I said to her, ‘I can work them down.’ I visited Mexico, I’m good at haggling. We’d get together after a night of drinking, just sort of fondle each other, never take it very far.”

“This was Anita?”

“What? No. No, I’m talking about Jacqueline now.”

“Who?”

“The proverbial one that got away.”

Brett was getting a little lost in Clarence’s stories. He was beginning to suspect that Clarence was lost as well.

“I am a lot of things,” Clarence thought. “I am shrewd. I am fun. I have a great laugh. The way I use words is occasionally wonderful, if you don’t mind people working blue. But I am not lost.” He was pensive for a moment. “I am thirsty. I am not an incredible talent. Not a hard worker, like you. Not an intellectual. That my clerks stole language from briefs to write their opinions is widely known. Did you know there were times I didn’t even read them? Why do I feel like I am having to justify myself to⁠—and I mean this with the utmost respect⁠—a man who has, let’s face it, exposed himself to people?”

“I had a drinking problem,” Brett thought. “It was the fruit of a moment’s thought. And after all, could she really claim to have been hurt? She’s got a family, a view of the ocean. Drives around town in a Volvo XC90. Outside of a blackout, it was widely known, I had impeccable manners, grace.”

“I was talking about the one where⁠—”

“Oh, right. That wasn’t anything.”

Clarence sighed. He thought, “I’ve seen two dragons.” 

“What?”

He rolled over onto his back and drew his knee to his chest and squinted at it. 

“What do they want?” Brett asked. 

“The truth, maybe.” Clarence shrugged, and for a moment Brett saw the world around him mislaid. "

    "text": "When my daughters turned twelve I initiated them into the mysterious powers with which women of my family line have since time immemorial been endowed. Mysterious not so much in that they didn’t know those powers existed, that I’d kept them secret (I hid nothing from my daughters, since we were of the same sex), but rather in that, having grown up dimly and apathetically aware of the powers’ reality, they no more understood the need to care or to suddenly somehow master them than they had any interest in learning to cook the dishes I served, the products of a domain just as remote and unenticing. Nonetheless, they never thought of rebelling against that tedious instruction. Not once, some sunny afternoon, did they invent a pretext to get out of it. I liked to think that this docility in my undocile daughters, my unruly, impulsive twins, was born of a recognition that, in spite of everything, they had a sacred obligation to uphold. 

We met in a spot well away from their father’s eye, down in the basement. The neighbor children’s shouts and laughs that came to us from the nearby lawn and the sunlight that slanted through the window and fell onto the concrete where we sat seemed to be trying to distract Maud and Lise from a dutiful concentration the point of which they couldn’t quite fathom but which they refused to give up, their brows obstinately furrowed, their little faces, equally diligent and intent, raised toward mine with a confident patience⁠—certain and indifferent as they were, from earliest childhood on, that their turn to possess my powers would come. When a session ended, off they ran, identical and brown in their striped rugby shirts, after giving me two perfunctory, sweetly condescending kisses on my sweaty brow. I knew they’d never speak to their playmates of what I’d just taught them. My daughters considered the secret of their powers strictly private, as well as fundamentally uninteresting. “You know, the gift can be a useful thing to have,” I told them, in hopes of appealing to their taste for efficacy. But my own talent was slight, apparently just strong enough to keep the gift going, to pass it along; I couldn’t name one time when it had come in handy. I had to work hard to glimpse insignificant details that revealed nothing at all: the color of an outfit, the look of the sky, a steaming coffee cup in the hand of the person fixed by my clairvoyant gaze … What, then, was I supposed to convince my skeptical daughters of? 

“Promise me one thing,” I went on. “If you ever have daughters, do with them as I’ve done with you for the past year.” 

But they only laughed, shrugging their sharp little shoulders. I found them so fierce, so resolute, so solidly asexual in the grimy jeans hanging loose around their slim hips that once again I let the matter drop, embarrassed to have let myself slip into sentimentality before that gruff little pair.

Still, it bothered me to think that the powers might be passed on no further. Their grandmother had grudgingly taught me, even though she so hated her own far mightier power that she never made use of it. She wouldn’t discuss it, probably did her best not to believe in it, considered it just one more in a whole hodgepodge of superstitions handed down by her illiterate mother. But she taught me what I now know, in bits and pieces to be sure, and with a palpable distaste that made me squirm in my chair. Perhaps her lack of faith was responsible for my limited abilities. In my daughters’ case, I could see that they would never feel obliged to obey any law whose violation entailed no serious consequences, that they would soon forget that passing the gift on was a law at all. How could I blame them? 

On the day Monsieur Matin came to dinner, my daughters sighed in gladness that after eleven months, they’d finally come to the end of the lessons. They each gave me a hurried kiss on their way out of the basement, and it occurred to me that when their father kissed them upon coming home from work that evening, he might somehow realize that my lessons had borne fruit. He must surely have guessed what sort of exercise my daughters and I were regularly engaging in downstairs. Maybe he’d been hoping, absurdly, that Maud and Lise would prove so unreceptive to the discipline he knew the process entailed that I would soon give up on the idea. How would he react that evening? He wouldn’t say anything about it to me. He would maintain the discretion tinged with contempt that he’d always shown concerning my powers. But I feared he might suddenly feel the same irrepressible aversion to Maud and Lise as he felt for me, an aversion his overworked mind didn’t see but which I saw all too well.

It wasn’t the girls I was worried about, convinced as I was that no change in the nuances of his amorphous displays of affection would affect their focus on promises and hopes well beyond the little their parents had laboriously attained. No, that would never touch them, not, at least, coming from their minimally interesting, irascible, overstressed father. My fear, as I climbed the basement stairs, was simply that adding even a touch more repulsion and resentment to the overstuffed baggage of my husband’s feelings might turn the quietly disharmonious atmosphere of the house overtly oppressive. 

“Oh hello, Isabelle,” I said at the top of the steps.

The stairs opened straight into the kitchen, so Isabelle had seen me come in with the harried look that the exercise of my paltry gift inevitably left on my face. As always, she’d made herself perfectly at home in our house, though she was scarcely more than a neighbor. She’d brought along her four- or five-year-old son, who had a vaguely American first name. Looking out the window, I spied him in the yard with Maud and Lise.

“So what did you see?” Isabelle immediately asked. 

When we’d first come to this city, two years before, I’d made the mistake of telling her about my powers. Isabelle had seemed a person of some importance whom, I thought at the time, I had to win over. She reigned uncontested over our little subdivision, her authority based on no objective virtue⁠—for Isabelle was neither pretty nor intelligent, hardworking nor thoughtful⁠—but rather imposed as a historical fact duly imparted from neighbor to neighbor. It was from Isabelle that we learned what had to be known of this or that neighbor’s ways to keep from upsetting the general entente of the neighborhood. Proud, obtuse, and inquisitive, her hair bleached, she strode from house to house, one hand tugging along her son, never failing to berate him copiously if he stumbled or fell, if he whimpered with fatigue; if, in short, he got on her nerves in any way. 

She immediately began to press me to tell her if her son would be admitted to the École Polytechnique. 

I dropped onto a chair, facing her across our oilcloth-draped table.

“You know, Isabelle, I never see much.”

“Right, but did you see the little moron this time, yes or no? Did you see him at that school?”

Isabelle’s face was flushed, impatient, peppered with acne scars. I realized that I was going to have to offer her an aperitif, and that she would stick around, this being her happy hour, which would keep me from cooking anything decent for Pierrot (my husband), who would shortly be home, no sooner pulling into the garage than becoming displeased not to be smelling any appetizing aromas⁠—yet more fuel for his imprecise, ineradicable indignation at all the nice dinners he had a right to and that I never had waiting. Poor Pierrot, I thought, always having to take a back seat to Isabelle. 

I took a deep breath, smiled, and answered: “I did make out something about your little Steve, yes⁠—I saw him, maybe twenty years old, walking down a wide avenue, under a morning sun full of promise. He was wearing a white shirt but no tie, I sensed a smile on his face. That’s what I saw, Isabelle. It took a lot of trying.” 

Then I half turned toward the window to stave off Isabelle, whose thin lips, a pale, dry crease she was gnawing in irritation, were readying a salvo of questions. 

Maud and Lise had disappeared. Abandoned, Steve was standing stock-still in the middle of the lawn, shivering in the dusk, arms dangling, looking lost and resigned. He knew his mother didn’t like him disturbing her when she was engaged in discussion; even when he was yards away she complained about having him underfoot. Patient and anxious, he was waiting for it to come time to go home. But his wait would be long this evening, because Isabelle had no intention of leaving until I told her what she wanted to hear. 

“No tie, you say, but people must wear ties in that place, all those Polywhatevers wear ties. What does that mean, Lucie, no tie?” 

“Well, first let’s call Steve in, he’s looking a bit chilly,” I pleaded blankly. 

“Oh, for once he’s keeping quiet, why do you want to get him started up again? Anyway, he must have had a tie. You think maybe he’d stuffed it into his pocket, that’s possible, you say you saw sunshine, maybe he stuffed it into his pants pocket?” 

“That could be. Like a touch of vermouth, Isabelle?” I jabbered merrily, still unable to shake the degrading need to keep that unlikable, calculating, acrimonious woman happy. She was younger than me, which I always found surprising and in a strange way delightful. Poor Isabelle, I sometimes thought, when I suddenly remembered she was only twenty-three or -four. Oh, poor Pierrot, I said to myself again as I poured out Isabelle’s red vermouth. 

I listened for the garage door, invaded by dread but incapable of sending Isabelle away. I heard Maud and Lise slam the front door and clump upstairs to their room. Darkness now enveloped Steve’s frail form. He was standing so still, probably numb with boredom and uncertainty, that he might have been mistaken for a new sort of garden gnome. On only one point had I lied to Isabelle: In my vision of him at twenty, striding down a street on a summer morning, he wasn’t smiling at all. His expression was one of poignant sadness; there was something failed and old on his banal little face. 

I threw open the window and called out: “Steve, come on in and have some orange juice.”

“That won’t work,” Isabelle said placidly, “he’ll only come if it’s me calling him. You wouldn’t have any peanuts, would you?” 

Upon which she jumped up, glass in hand, leaned half out the window, and bellowed: “Get in here, now!” 

Then she sat down again, sour and self-satisfied, and drained her vermouth, smacking her lips, while I rummaged for peanuts in the cupboard and little Steve, wrenched to attention by his mother’s command, hurried toward the kitchen. He stood by the door and I handed him his juice. He had his mother’s big, bulging eyes, and not knowing where he had permission to direct them, his gaze was fleeting, tortured, terrified, and defeated, even when she wasn’t near. 

I refilled Isabelle’s glass, pushed the bowl of peanuts her way. From her detached, listless air, I sensed a boastful melancholy coming. She delicately twisted the rings she wore on each finger, silver-plated metal bands ornamented with the head of a lion, a big heart, fat letters: I AM OK. It was then that I noticed, Steve having unzipped his jacket, that dozens of words were scattered every which way over his clothes, his polo shirt, his track pants, his tennis shoes: LITTLE BEAR⁠—BEST TEAM⁠—HEADING FOR NY⁠—BIKES AND CARS⁠—HI MAN. 

“Won’t your husband be getting worried?” I murmured. “It’s already past eight o’clock.”

I tried to turn my vision toward Pierrot, but all I could see was the glowing tip of his cigarette. 

“Hey, you saw something,” said Isabelle. “What was it?”

She filled her mouth with peanuts, amassing them in the hollow of one cheek and then knocking them out between her teeth one by one with her tongue. 

“I need to know, Lucie, I really need you to tell me, what sort of life am I going to have in a few years, with Steve on my hands? If on top of everything else he doesn’t get into that school, if he didn’t have a tie, his neck out in the open like a nobody … Hey, Steve, how is it that Lucie saw you without a tie, huh? What’s that supposed to mean? You think your mommy’s going to put up with you becoming a nobody?” 

Steve looked my way, hoping for help, for an explanation, and at the same time he nervously twiddled his fly, which was stamped with a jaunty THE BEST OF YOU. 

“I’m sure Steve will do the best he can,” I said with conviction. “Go on, go pee-pee, you know where the bathroom is.” 

“Go pee, Steve,” Isabelle said magnanimously. 

She sighed, drained her glass in one go, forced the last peanut from her cheek. Suddenly happy, she sighed again. “Ah, this life of mine!” 

Then at last she stood and stretched, her turtleneck riding up over her white, prominent belly, the black leggings so tightly girdling her legs that her crotch was perfectly, guilelessly defined. Maud and Lise burst into the kitchen like avid little animals. 

“Mama, we’re hungry. Steve pissed all over the seat, he’s afraid to come out.” 

Isabelle groaned, but the two vermouths, mingled with a contemplative overview of her still-hopeful existence, had left her sluggish and lenient, so she didn’t make a move. Not to mention that her principles on the need for maternal authority did not require that Steve show himself in the best possible light at all times.

I found the boy standing in the bathroom with the lights out. He was trembling, living as he did in constant incomprehension of what adults felt about him and wanted from him, and since I was too beleaguered to try to reassure him, I simply pulled him out by one hand. “Come on, really, you could be more careful, you’re a big boy now.”

In the kitchen, Isabelle was holding forth to the girls, and I could see she’d gotten just what she wanted. Maud and Lise didn’t hate Isabelle, even if they already looked on her with the unconscious, subtle, decorous disdain of children who knew that the richest possibilities of a plush and triumphant existence were offered to them daily. I supposed that Maud and Lise recognized in her a crude, unthinking force similar to their own, even as they sensed the superiority of their intelligence over Isabelle’s cunning. It was the Garden Club that gave my daughters their breathtaking self-assurance, I thought, and let go of Steve’s hand. 

“So, little slob, you made a mess at Lucie’s?” She gave Steve a crisp, automatic smack on the top of his head, then threw out a suddenly tired-sounding “bye-bye” and bustled off. 

I watched them walk away down the street that ran past our identical houses, and all at once I felt a sort of compassion for their slightly misshapen silhouettes, Isabelle hulking in her big champion-athlete shoes, the boy frail and weedy, lurching along because his mother walked too fast for him. Poor Steve, I thought, which reminded me that I still had to wipe up the pee. 

Maud and Lise had turned on the kitchen TV and were doing their homework on the table, nibbling potato chips from a bag. My tongue burned with a longing to ask if they’d used their new powers since their lesson, and how they rated their clarity, their precision, but discretion forbade me to question them. I then said, a bit crossly: “You could have helped the kid out, instead of coming and blabbing.” Maud looked at me for a few seconds in surprise, and her charming little face, sharp, almost identical to Lise’s, expressed so sincere an ignorance of what I was talking about that I was once again at a loss for words. “Why do we have to be nice to Steve? He’s got nothing going on up here,” said Maud, tapping her forehead.

She turned her eyes back to the screen. Her hair stopped at her sharp little chin. My daughters’ perfection filled me with wonder. I sighed all the same, then picked up the mop and, as I turned toward the bathroom, had a vision of Pierrot’s face haloed in blue, probably from the plush upholstery in his car. If he’s driving, I still have a few minutes, I told myself in relief, though faintly troubled to have seen⁠—I thought⁠—Pierrot’s lips moving: Who could he be talking to? 

My husband was on his way home from the Garden Club twenty miles away, where he spent his days trying to persuade well-to-do couples to buy a lifetime of annual weeklong vacations in spots as varied as they were idyllic, all over the world⁠—just one short week a year, but Pierrot made it his business to show them how unforgettable that week would be. All told, he offered the customers hundreds of marvelous days for, he would intone, an almost disgracefully nominal fee. At the Garden Club, the strategy for conquest was planned out down to the minute. Invited by a flattering letter two weeks before, potential customers came to lunch amid the club’s manicured grounds, girded with tall iron bars, deep in the countryside. They were welcomed by Pierrot, who would guide them around the vast buffet of exotic salads, seizing the occasion to slip in a few preliminary remarks on the opportunity he was handing them, and then accompany them to the swimming pool, the sauna, the massage room, always waiting close by in his light gray suit with the crest of the club, every half hour advancing a step further in his exposé of the inconceivable privileges that would come with the purchase of an annual week’s relaxation in Bora-Bora, Miami, Trouville, virtually anywhere the most perverse fancy might inspire a person to go. Next came an intimate dinner with his prey, their skin rosy and perfumed, their souls grateful for the lavish reception, pleased that a man as imposing as Pierrot, with his perfectly loose suit, his severe, chiseled face, had never let them out of his sight, and by the end of the meal, he would know if he’d won the day. That was what Pierrot did, and he was paid for every contract signed. So far, he was the only agent at the Garden Club who’d persuaded an average of one couple out of two, and the aureole of that prestige did not fade when he drove through the ironwork gates but enveloped him all the way into our house, an emanation of pride and success concretized by a regular influx of money. An hour at home and his moodiness took over again, but the modest glory in which his triumphs at the Garden Club bathed him was enough to nourish Maud and Lise’s social pretensions, even if they now aimed far higher for their own futures. I knew that Pierrot didn’t enjoy wasting his money on trinkets, fancy shoes, and sophisticated toys for the girls, that he had an atavistic reluctance to reaching for the most expensive in an array of similar products, but I recognized, too, his pride at seeing how natural that gesture was for Maud and Lise, how little they cared for frugality. When they were older, I thought, Maud and Lise would intimidate him with their inborn ability to spend without remorse, whereas he always had to force himself, to do bitter battle with the inflexible figure of his mama, a schoolteacher in Poitiers, who considered any purchase not rooted in strict necessity indecent and contemptible. Already, I brooded as I wrung out the mop over the sink, he was delighted to see them so difficult at the dinner table, so demanding, and embarrassed to let them see him delight in a wedge of Camembert.

What he took for my complicity with his mama, when in truth she and I were simply expressing plain, reasonable common sense while he so labored to indulge himself, was partly responsible, I could feel it, for his hostility toward me, though he felt no such thing toward her. He forgave his mama her stingy, backward ways, but the fact that I more or less shared her ideas about extravagance⁠—I who, like him, had gone to business college, and had, like him, then gone on to work in a bank⁠—Pierrot saw as a plot to humiliate him, to hold him back, to forever remind him, by way of our modest domestic surroundings, of where we’d come from. He feared that, should some customer of the Garden Club one day stop by for a drink at our house, he would see at a glance that Pierrot was not the distinguished high roller that he wanted to seem, not realizing that his duties at the club, despite his pearl-gray suit and crest, were meant to shield the guests against any temptation to see him as an equal. Pierrot had come to despise me when he caught me in some chore that the ladies of the club didn’t know it was even possible to engage in, such as wiping up little Steve’s pee-pee. 

What could I do? I looked after the house, having failed to find work in our little city; I watched Maud and Lise grow, bewildered; and I tested my lackluster powers, here and there glimpsing a future that could only trouble me without teaching me much. 

The best thing I’d done in ages, I told myself as I hung the mop out on the terrace, was initiate Maud and Lise. 

The April night was misty and cold, the subdivision’s streets empty, the red-leaved trees planted with unassailable equity in front of each house still so stunted that it seemed unlikely you might live to see them looking even slightly less ridiculous. I wiped my damp hands on my hips and heard our car driving up. My earlier trepidation returned, and I began to hope that Pierrot wouldn’t notice anything about Maud and Lise that might rouse his hostility. 

But why should I be afraid of Pierrot? I asked myself for the thousandth time, losing patience with my own cowardice. After all, he’d never raised a hand to anyone on earth. 

That evening, for the first time ever, Pierrot didn’t come home alone. A man climbed out of the passenger seat and followed after him, shivering in his springtime jacket. My husband introduced him like so: “This is Monsieur Matin, a former client of the club. He’ll be having dinner with us, and possibly spending the night.” 

Pierrot’s air was severe, a touch uneasy, and as he walked by me without looking at me, forgetting even to let Monsieur Matin enter first, I sensed in astonishment that he was embarrassed to have imposed this guest on me out of the blue. I myself was still in jeans and slippers. Then a sort of enthusiasm came over me at the thought that I wouldn’t have to face Pierrot directly tonight, that the presence of a guest would keep him from showing any sign of testiness, so I trotted off to the kitchen, letting my husband guide Monsieur Matin to the living room, and turned off the television, hurriedly whispering to Maud and Lise: “Run and get three pizzas from Isabelle, tell her it’s urgent.” 

Isabelle liked to boast that her freezer was always stuffed with pizzas of every brand and variety, because she wasn’t about to play the good little mommy to the point of serving anything but to that little pest Steve and his drone of a father, those two halfwits, who, furthermore, never uttered a word of complaint and wolfed down their pizzas as if they’d never eaten anything better, et cetera. 

I slipped Lise a fifty-franc bill to give to Isabelle, then brought the bottle of vermouth to the living room. Facing each other in the big leather armchairs that my husband had recently picked out, Monsieur Matin and Pierrot sat in silence, exuding solemnity, rather alike with their gray suits and their short, tidy hair. All the same, Monsieur Matin seemed freer and more relaxed than Pierrot, and on his smooth, fresh, well-shaved face a dignified expression, at once pained and pleased with himself, contrasted brutally, I thought, with Pierrot’s agitation, his sudden nervousness. Their loafers gleamed identically, and their slender, pale shins emerged demurely from their similarly patterned socks, my husband’s pink, pale green for Monsieur Matin. 

“The girls went off to get some pizzas,” I said brightly. “You don’t mind pizza, do you, Monsieur Matin?” 

“Monsieur Matin has left home,” said Pierrot gravely. 

I looked at Monsieur Matin with polite interest as he underscored his pose of virtuous appeasement and noble suffering with a jerk of his chin. Seeing my husband so tense before the serene Monsieur Matin, you might have thought it was Pierrot who’d burned his bridges, as if Monsieur Matin had abruptly taken possession of our brand-new living room and of our whole house that so arduously aspired to luxury. 

Not looking at me, Pierrot spoke again: “This afternoon, Monsieur Matin left his wife and son, and he came for a rest at the club. I suggested he spend his first night away from home at our house rather than a hotel. Monsieur Matin plans to rent a studio apartment in town. That’s the situation.” 

“Aren’t you going to call your wife?” I asked Monsieur Matin. 

“Why should he call her when he’s just left her?” Pierrot snapped. “When he’s just made it clear to her that what he wants is to stop seeing her day after day, to stop having to talk to her day after day? Why on earth should he call her?” 

Now Pierrot was glaring at me, bent forward in his armchair, knees apart, still wearing his Garden Club jacket, looking more like a guest than a host, and as I told myself that he had no real reason to be angry with me about Monsieur Matin and his wife, I began to notice that he never looked away from Monsieur Matin without turning back toward him more intently, and that Monsieur Matin accepted that extreme, mute attention with the quiet aplomb of a man who does not doubt his own worth. 

Pierrot sat still even when Maud and Lise came in, didn’t get up to give them a hug, pretended he hadn’t seen them. Isabelle was there too, supposedly because I owed her fourteen francs for the pizzas but in truth, I realized, for a look at our dinner guest. Stationed in the middle of the living room, she quickly inspected him up and down, and then, that duty discharged, went on her way, coolly, probably a bit put out that no one was calling her back, but as if stripped of some of her fearsomeness without little Steve at her side. Monsieur Matin made the requisite fuss over Maud and Lise. 

“What a pretty pair of chickadees,” he said, patting their heads. 

I asked Pierrot to pour Monsieur Matin a drink and went off to put the pizzas in the oven, wondering what it was that fascinated my husband about this Monsieur Matin, who was so like himself. 

Sitting around the long dining room table we almost never used, we struggled to cut up Isabelle’s tough, dry pizzas. Monsieur Matin grabbed a piece with both hands and dug in, trying not to let his hunger show, exaggerating his distant, pious, faintly superior air. Pierrot ate nothing, wholly occupied in questioning Monsieur Matin about his marriage. The most banal answer he gave led to a sententious “I see, I see,” or little cries of admiration so ill suited to the subject that Monsieur Matin found himself forced to put down his pizza, wipe his tomato-smeared lips, and insist he’d done nothing exceptional, which Pierrot would immediately deny with the most disarming sincerity. 

“Why did you leave, Monsieur Matin?” asked Lise. 

Caught up in Pierrot’s ardor, never having seen him so enthusiastic, so aquiver with intense, almost artistic emotion, our two daughters soon pushed their plates aside to watch Monsieur Matin eat and talk, and I felt a stab in my heart to see their proud faces respectfully turned toward the smooth, pale countenance, lips puffed out with self-regard, of the great man that he had suddenly become. 

“All the kid cares about is his mother,” he explained, “it’s been that way from the start, whatever I do it’s not what he needs, it’s only Mama, Mama, he can only fall asleep with Mama, he can only wake up with Mama, eat with Mama, it’s like I don’t exist, I’m only there to drive the car and bring home money, how long can a man live like that nowadays? In the evening his mother keeps him beside her on the couch instead of putting him in his little bed, saying good night, and closing the door, she sits him in her lap like a big baby, like a big cat she caresses him, and they end up both falling asleep in front of me while I twiddle my thumbs in the armchair, and then I have to wake them up, carry the animal to his room, he screams and pummels me with his paws, and meanwhile Mama carefully avoids getting involved, Mama quietly goes off to take a shower and dab on some perfume, then comes back and with one word, just one single word, quiets the kid who was still shrieking at the sight of me. Why, honestly, should I have to tolerate being nothing at all in my own house, as much for the mama as for the … for that creature, being less than any household pet? What do you think of that, Pierrot?” 

And Monsieur Matin snatched up the last slice of pizza and with a sort of vengeful fury took a big bite, as if he were holding a piece of the mama’s or the child’s flesh. 

“Clearly you were right to leave,” Pierrot declared. 

I then realized that Pierrot was consumed with jealousy, that he envied Monsieur Matin and was finding it ever harder to hide his feelings. In a voice that brooked no appeal I ordered Monsieur Matin to call his wife at once, then got up and went off for Pierrot’s telephone. 

“Just tell her you’re at our house and there’s nothing to worry about.” 

“All right, if you insist,” said Monsieur Matin, dutifully. 

His face had grown inflamed as he ate, and now it was so red and puffy that it clashed violently with his self-assured pose. He punched in the number as we watched. Pierrot looked on with a frown. No more did he resemble his guest, whose face had abruptly swelled and deflated; gradually he was recovering the curt, peevish authority that was his when he came home from the Garden Club. 

Monsieur Matin pretended to listen to prolonged ringing, then put his hand over the phone and whispered: “Nobody home.” 

Such deep apprehension shone in his glistening eye that I yanked back the phone. 

“Hello, hello?” an irritated voice was saying on the other end. 

I introduced myself as Pierrot’s wife. 

“Well, I don’t know any Pierrot,” said Madame Matin, “but I assume my husband is at your place and that was him calling again and not daring to speak. He does that every time he takes off, you know. I also assume he managed not to come in his car, so Nounou and I will have to drive out and get him. You tell him this is the last time.” 

“She wants to come pick you up,” I told Monsieur Matin. 

He gestured at me to agree to whatever she wanted, then somewhat overdramatically put his head in his hands. I gave Madame Matin our address and she brusquely hung up. 

“Who is Nounou?” I asked, to break the silence. 

“That’s the kid, the little beast who hates me,” cried Monsieur Matin, roughly pushing back his chair, the legs screeching on our new flame-glazed floor tiles. 

I saw Pierrot suppress a grimace. He seemed determined to stay silent, and his suddenly squared shoulders and clenched jaw, along with a glimmer of cold, professional politeness that gave his gaze a detached, supercilious air, told me without question that he now felt for Monsieur Matin only what he felt for any of his clients, a systematic, impersonal respect for their comfortable financial status. The new Monsieur Matin seemed to interest Maud and Lise not much more. Tilting back in their chairs, legs apart, they followed him with a circumspect stare. 

I leaned in nearer to Lise and heard her tell Maud, in a voice without emotion: “Pooh, we won’t be playing basketball tomorrow, it’s going to rain.”

And Maud nodded, indifferent, her thin face half-turned toward Monsieur Matin (who was now pacing around the living room) with the same look of cold respect as Pierrot’s, perfected over the past two years at the Garden Club.

So I had proof that Lise, at least, was using her powers, and this enchanted me. 

Pierrot had heard her just as I had. He quickly looked away, pretending not to notice, but his jaw hardened further and under the table his leg had an agitated, irrepressible twitch.

“So, how old is this Nounou exactly?” I asked Monsieur Matin.

“Oh, three or four, somewhere in there,” he said. 

Then, sensing that his story had lost a good deal of its value for my husband, since Pierrot had scooted his chair as far from Monsieur Matin as he could and was leaning back, arms crossed, eyes narrowed, Monsieur Matin threw me a desperate, clinging look, yearning to justify himself. Dabs of tomato sauce clung to the corners of his mouth. Purplish patches, born of tension and fear, appeared on his insipid driven-young-executive face, and as I stood there, dirty dinner plates in my hands, Monsieur Matin bowed down before me, his eyes on my grimy-toed slippers, and spoke to me softly. 

“How is it, madame, that from the very start I’ve never been able to do the right thing with Nounou? Can you explain, is it my fault, or did his mama plan the whole thing so she could have Nounou’s love to herself? I don’t understand it at all, I’ve never understood anything about that kid, I’ve tried, but it’s no good. He doesn’t like the presents I give him, doesn’t listen to what I tell him, I bore him. And yet when he was a baby, so often I was the one who looked after him. Yes, I got up in the middle of the night, all those things you have to do for a baby, I did them. And now I hardly dare come home in the evening after work. Can you imagine, sometimes I drive slowly around the neighborhood, all around the house, I circle the block six or seven times before I can work up the courage to go in and find Nounou and my wife, always together, laughing, playing, hugging, always the two of them, and no one says hello when I come in, they keep up what they’re doing as if they hadn’t even seen me. I’m afraid of them both, I’m nothing to them, barely a shadow, but a shadow that gets in the way. Why did you make me call her, madame? If you hadn’t put that phone in my hands, if you hadn’t said anything to my wife, then we wouldn’t be where we are, her feeling obligated to come pick me up, but furious about it, and me, me …” 

“I just didn’t think you should abandon them,” I murmured. 

“Right, but what do you actually know?” 

The doorbell rang. Monsieur Matin dismissed me with a resigned smile, and I scuffed in my slippers to the front door, one hand supporting the pile of plates on my hip, the other turning the two deadbolts and unhooking the chain we automatically latch as soon as we’re in the house, like everyone who lives in this neighborhood. 

Madame Matin was there, about to ring again, incensed, stylish, and poised, accompanied by a strange boy with yellow eyes, easily twelve years old, a head taller than her. She gave me a perfunctory smile and refused to come in, saying she’d rather wait for her husband right where she was, on the front step, in the biting cold of the April night he’d forced them out into, Nounou and herself. 

“Oh, this is Nounou?” I asked. “I thought he was younger.” 

“My husband refuses to see that he’s growing up,” said Madame Matin irritably. “So, is he coming, or does he think we’re going to stand out here all night?” 

“All right, I’ll go get him,” I said, impressed in spite of myself by Madame Matin’s elegance, by the imperious, unthinking way she’d laid her red-nailed fingers on big Nounou’s sleeve to stop him from coming in as I’d asked. 

I detoured through the kitchen so I could put down the plates, then slowly made my way back to the living room, glancing toward the open front door, through which, behind Nounou and Madame Matin, I spied Isabelle walking past our front gate, tugging little Steve in her wake, her gait affectedly casual, her eyes fixed in our direction. 

She saw Madame Matin’s car drive up from her window, I told myself, and ran out to see what we’re up to. 

Monsieur Matin wasn’t in the living room, only Pierrot, surly and distant. 

I sighed. “Where is he? Where are the girls?” 

“Maud and Lise went up to bed,” Pierrot muttered. 

“What about him?” 

“Him who?” 

And then, seeing it ajar, I went to the back door, opened it, and peered out. At the far end of the yard, Monsieur Matin was struggling over the hedge, his thin pale-green springtime jacket billowing in the wind. He landed in the neighbors’ yard and galloped out of sight. 

Two days later, when Pierrot didn’t come home, I told myself that the club must have kept him late for a group motivation session, a regularly scheduled event intended to arouse a sense of rivalry among the salespeople. I directed my special, mediocre gaze his way, just in case. And what I saw then told me at once that I wouldn’t be seeing Pierrot the next day, and perhaps not anytime soon. His hard, irritable, resentful face, chiseled and unmelancholy, stood out against the sunlit background of a clear blue sky, and behind his shoulder loomed the two towers of the cathedral of Poitiers, as if trying to ensure I didn’t miss them. 

He must be staying at his mother’s house, I thought. 

I fell into a deep bewilderment. Our most recent visit to Poitiers had been six years before. How could Pierrot, always exasperated and mortified by his mother, have gone back to her, back to the stuffy, dull, gray row house, the furniture, knickknacks, and rugs of a childhood he remembered as ugly and parsimonious, mired in that sad little dump of a house on a modest street lined with other dumpy little houses, their doors occasionally opening onto the suspicious faces of small-minded retirees? 

I found Maud and Lise in the kitchen, watching television. 

“Your father’s gone to Poitiers,” I said. 

The same grimace came over both faces. 

“Yuck,” said Maud. “To Grandmother’s? No thank you!” 

“I’d rather die right here where I sit than go to Poitiers,” Lise chimed in with an adorable jerk of her obstinate chin. 

“He wasn’t thinking we’d join him,” I added, hesitantly. 

Then: “He might be there for a while.” 

“Oh,” they said calmly. 

“So he took off, did he?” Lise patiently asked. 

“Oh, I don’t know, I don’t know anything yet.” 

“If you don’t know anything, that means he’s ditched you. That’s how it always happens,” Maud concluded. 

My daughters’ knowledge of human behavior was so coarse, international, and standardized that it had an undeniable usefulness in very common situations such as this. They talked to each other for a moment as commercials went by on the screen, wondering if their father had driven to Poitiers or gone to Paris to take the TGV, then abruptly dropped these logistical speculations to watch their evening show. To my relief, they seemed no more disturbed than if all this were an episode from the lives of the people
now airing their sorrows, before my rapt daughters’ eyes, on the confessions-and-secrets series they so loved. 

“Everything’s going to be all right,” I promised them.

Weren’t you supposed to console your children when their father went away, weren’t you supposed to reassure them, and cherish them all the more? But my daughters, young though they were, aspired to an existence more magnificent than ours, even if they got from Pierrot nearly everything they could wish for. Maud and Lise seemed to inhabit a distant, hypothetical world, the world of their future glory, where no incident of the present had a place."

    "text": "The bimonthly meeting was scheduled for three o’clock. The attendees included: my colleagues, depressed after a long day of work; two mothers, eager to represent fifty parents who couldn’t care less about being represented; and two precocious students⁠—Stefano D’Ovidio and Liliana Meneghini⁠—who were easily corrupted by the discovery that, as class representatives, they could say things they never could otherwise.

When I walked into the room, everyone was staring at a caricature that someone had drawn on the chalkboard: me as a bumbling giant with a hunchback and the neck of a giraffe, embracing a voluptuous student and planting a kiss on her cheek. Below the girl they’d written “Giusy Solofra, teacher’s pet.”

As soon as they saw me, the two mothers, the two students, and my colleagues all ceased their snickering. Then, in unison, everyone proceeded to feign horror⁠—“There’s no such thing as respect anymore, no such thing”⁠—as I hurriedly erased the board and sputtered, “No, no, it’s not like that at all. The kids love me. We talk freely, we have an antiauthoritarian, democratic relationship, like brothers and sisters⁠—isn’t that right, D’Ovidio?”

My colleague Calamaro, whom the principal had delegated to lead the meeting in his place, muttered, “You have no idea how much a babysitter is costing me.” She went on to appoint me secretary, which essentially meant taking minutes, writing down verbatim what was said.

I put up the usual fight. “Why is it always me?” 

“Because you’re Literature.”

“So?” 

“So if I had to file taxes I’d ask Zinale, since he’s Accounting.” 

I turned to Zinale and whispered, “It’s your turn, you freak.”

“No,” Zinale replied, happy to hold a business degree. 

“What are you, illiterate?”

“Yup,” Zinale said, more smug than ever.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw the two mothers whispering to each other, probably saying, These teachers don’t even know how to string proper sentences together! They’re illiterate!

“Fine”⁠—I had made my decision⁠—“I’ll do it. But you’ll pay for this one day, Zinale.” Calamaro moved to start the meeting.

Depressed, I wrote: “November 5, 1990: the staff meeting commenced at 3:10 p.m.”

“Literature,” Calamaro began.

In schoolspeak, Literature means me, because that’s what I teach. I had to briefly report on how the class was doing. In long, flowing, well-constructed sentences, I said that I had no significant complaints about the students, except for a certain group of kids⁠—and here I stared meaningfully at D’Ovidio and Meneghini⁠—who occasionally interrupted my lessons. Then I wrote down what I had just said but in an even more elegant form.

Each of my colleagues went on to say pretty much the same thing about their own classes, but awkwardly, because they don’t teach literature. When I transcribed their comments I made them all sound a little worse, especially Zinale; I even had him make a couple of grammatical mistakes, which I put in quotation marks. None of them dared say, the way we do when we’re alone, that these kids really should be in reform schools. That’s what happens at these meetings: We say everything’s fine, things are moving along nicely; we don’t air our dirty laundry in public. At the very most we might mention, gingerly, how rude the students can be, but only if there’s documentation to prove that their parents or their former teachers⁠—not us⁠—are to blame.

“Parents, anything to add?” Calamaro snapped, as if to say: Make it quick.

The two ladies mustered the courage to speak. “Everything seems to be going fine … except for Italian.” (And by Italian, they meant me: I can be identified by way of any of the subjects I teach⁠—language, literature, or history.) “The kids don’t understand him when he lectures,” they said, adding that, nevertheless, the students found me engaging. What they meant was that although everyone enjoyed my lessons, they couldn’t really say what I was going on about.

“But⁠—” I protested.

“Are you getting all this⁠—verbatim?” Calamaro asked, silencing me.

I thought, Verba volant, scripta manent, the only Latin I still remembered, and transcribed their words with gusto: “The parent representatives emphasized that the literature lessons are particularly engaging, if at times somewhat complex.”

“Okay,” Calamaro said. “Meeting adjourned.”

“Already?” the two mothers exclaimed; they had volunteered under the impression that they’d be entertained well into the evening.

“What about us?” D’Ovidio and Meneghini cried.

“You’ve got something to say, too?” Calamaro asked, with a glare.

“Oh, just one or two things,” D’Ovidio said, summarizing in the following manner: The fact that the students don’t understand my lessons was the least of it; the real problem was that I mock and humiliate them; I don’t encourage them enough⁠—on the contrary, I discourage them and they get depressed, which makes it impossible for them to study at home; also, I eat their snacks, I say things like “Give me a cracker, I’m starving”; and moreover, I’m always fawning over Giusy Solofra, who’s my favorite, and giving her the snacks I’ve stolen from the rest of the class.

“Lies! All lies,” I defended myself, ears burning with embarrassment. “You miscreants! You hardly ever come to class and never open your books.”

The two mothers chimed in, thrilled by how the afternoon was shaping up. “Kids! What’s all this about? You shouldn’t go around telling lies!”

Then Liliana Meneghini spoke up. “It’s the truth. The class asked us to bring it up. We couldn’t not mention it.”

“Fine, you’ve informed us,” Calamaro concluded, checking her watch, then looking at me with disdain. “Write it down. Thank you, and goodbye.”

“What troublemakers,” the two mothers exclaimed. “A good whipping! That’s what they need. A firm hand …”

“Sometimes you give a hand and they grab a whole arm,” I added. 

“Did you get all that?” Calamaro asked.

I quickly transcribed: “Student representatives D’Ovidio and Meneghini communicated how much the entire class appreciates the literature teacher. However, some individuals feel left out and wish they received more attention. The meeting was adjourned at 3:50 P.M.”

 

 

 

The Engine



My colleague Alassio is the only person left at the school where I teach who believes that the working class is the engine of history. “Does history still have an engine?” some of us anxiously ask ourselves. “Who is the new engine?” others torture themselves wondering. But most of us couldn’t care less, and not just about the engine but about history too. And yet on this subject my colleague Alassio is categorical: “It’s the truth,” he says. “Without the working class, even the clocks would stop ticking.”

Naturally, he does have his own share of doubts. That history has an engine is not one of them; this much seems indisputable. But, like everyone else, he’d like to know in exactly which direction history and its engine are headed. For this reason, he keeps a close eye on the grand narratives as well as the small and midsize ones; on ideological barriers, walls high and low; on the way the North goes south and the South comes north; on communism, a term that, in a matter of years, will require a lengthy footnote to be understood; on social classes and blocs; on newspapers and notebooks, like the one I’m using to try to get down everything he’s saying as he’s saying it, until he notices and asks, “What are you writing? Stop that.”

He’s particularly worried about the younger generation. They’re sad, he says, lanky and fat and confused, and they don’t give a single thought to either history or its engine: their devotions are to the raptures of the church or else the club.

Alassio has been keeping watch over the youth for years. To monitor them and collect his data, he has them write papers: on what they think, what their dreams are, what sorts of work their mothers and fathers do. Their parents’ professions are particularly meaningful to his work as an educator. The more degrading their jobs, the more Alassio takes their children’s fates to heart. The fact is that the parents of our school on the outskirts of the city hold all manner of degrading jobs, and this means that he ends up caring deeply for all⁠—or almost all⁠—of his students. There are hardly any representatives of the middle class⁠—at the very most, a few shop-owners or office flunkies, in whose children Alassio tries to instill stronger values than had been impressed upon them. But most of the students come from families who work in textile, cement, steel, or chemical factories, and Alassio dotes on them: lends them books, invites them to his house, introduces them to his wife and children. Occasionally a parent will grow suspicious of his attentions and inquire of the principal, “Why is this teacher so obsessed with my daughter?” And while the principal doesn’t like Alassio⁠—because he’s always stirring up trouble⁠—he never fails to reply, “Don’t worry, he’s no pervert. He just takes his mission as an educator very seriously.”

Recently, my colleague gave his students an in-class writing assignment with the following prompt: “A couple decides to take a holiday. Carefully define who they are, from a sociological point of view, and describe some of their adventures.”

“Nice topic,” I said. Personally, I’m always short on ideas. 

But after reading their stories, Alassio was unhappy. “Here, read this,” he said, handing me the work of one Selvaggia Colella, who had written very creatively (which is to say, in an Italian riddled with errors) about Giada, a professional fashion model, and her vacation to Kenya with a Tornado fighter pilot.

“So?” I asked.

“The girl’s father spends his days mixing cement,” Alassio told me with a troubled groan.

“And?”

To help me better understand the problem, he read me more of the stories, about other remarkable couples. A journalist and a young antiques dealer go to Norway to contemplate the fjords; a stockbroker and an interior decorator travel to California for Christmas; a stripper and a cornet player spend a dreamy week in Morocco; a DJ and a television reporter run away to Haiti together, though it isn’t entirely clear why.

As he read, my colleague informed me of what the parents of each of the authors of these travelogues did for a living: one man worked in a small factory in the Valle del Sacco and left his house at four o’clock in the morning to get to work on time; a widowed mother cleaned the stairwells of an apartment building; a father with lung disease was a trucker.

“Now do you understand?” Alassio said, bristling with rage as he handed me one sheet of paper after another. The future of the next generation, as seen through his eyes, was rife with senseless dreams, dangerous distractions, non-callus-forming jobs, pointless expenditures of energy that ultimately produced nothing, foreheads and armpits sweaty solely from having fun. His role as an educator⁠—he tried to get me to say “our role as educators”⁠—was not to look away and pretend nothing was happening. So, to drive home to the students just how backbreaking manual labor really was, he failed them all and gave them threes.

“That’ll teach them,” he concluded. I didn’t dare ask what. 

Then Signor Colella⁠—Selvaggia’s father⁠—showed up.

Colella was a sullen man: burly and weathered by exposure to the elements, he had massive hands; like Alassio, he was an ex-CGIL trade union activist furious about all the settlements, sellouts, compromises, betrayals, and so on. My colleague was thrilled to sit down with a fellow cog in the engine of history, but Signor Colella did not seem equally pleased. He had taken an hour off work to find out why his daughter had received a three. And that’s exactly what he asked: “Why?” 

My colleague Alassio tried to explain his line of thinking, confident that he was speaking to someone who, due not to his natural disposition but to a socioeconomic one, would understand him better than I had. Unfortunately, he encountered a few setbacks: the ferocious glint in the man’s eye, his trembling lip, his shaky, menacing broad hands. Alassio could get out only a few words before Colella interrupted him to politely ask why he was constantly inviting his daughter to his house, and always with the same excuse: “I’ll lend you my copy of Letters from Resistance Fighters Sentenced to Death.” 

So, to avoid being misunderstood, my comrade read Selvaggia’s story aloud from start to finish, as if to say, Listen to this! When he was done, he gave the girl’s father a hefty and amicable clap on the back and, switching to the informal tu, said, “While you’re hard at work mixing cement, she’s on a photo shoot in Kenya with a pilot! Where is this world headed?”

Alassio had been hoping to be reassured on the state of the pistons of the universe and the universality of his goals. He was ready to throw up his hands and say, I’m struggling here, people keep throwing wrenches into the works, why do I even try? But Colella bluntly replied, “Fashion model or not, quit buzzing around my daughter.” After which he added, “I’d like to see you try and work a cement mixer!” And: “How dare you speak to me in the tu form! Who do you think you are? When have we ever eaten off the same plate?”

 

 

 

Belinda’s Mother



Politically speaking, my colleague Zanella, an old CGIL trade union activist, detests Alessandro Manzoni, bitterly classifying him as nothing more than a nineteenth-century democristiano. “The plight of the meek?” Zanella scoffs. “Please. Manzoni was as dedicated to the meek as animal rights groups are to animals.”

Zanella has been reading The Betrothed out loud to his ninth- and tenth-grade students with great irony for decades now, laughing to himself, “How sappy can you get?” But lately, Manzoni seems to be carving out a place in Zanella’s chest like a malignant tumor. He still starts off in his usual mocking way, but these days, after only a few sentences, this gruff and fiery man is drawn into the story despite himself and begins to stammer like Don Abbondio, speak in threatening tones like the bravi, and reach for his dagger like Renzo; he even manages to dig out of his broad chest a voice as wispy as Lucia’s. 

Not long ago, the principal, hearing shouts from Zanella’s classroom as he passed by, poked his head through the door. Inside was Zanella, but he wasn’t quite himself, and hadn’t been for some time. He was Gertrude⁠—the noble Signora and Nun of Monza. And he was languidly strolling from the classroom window toward Belinda Tiraboschi’s desk. He toyed with long, immodest locks of hair as he walked. He adjusted his breasts under an imaginary habit with his big hairy hands dusty with chalk. And, smacking his plump lips under his mustache, he said in an insinuating tone, “You are the one who should tell us whether this nobleman did indeed pursue you improperly.” To which Belinda stammered her line in reply: “Signora … Mother … Reverend … ,” leaving the rest of the class to collapse in hysterics.

The principal quickly shut the door on Zanella in that muddled state: he was half Zanella and half Nun of Monza, partially at school and partially at the convent. The principal didn’t tell anyone what he’d seen, but he nonetheless instructed the custodians to keep an eye on Zanella through the keyhole, in case he suddenly started ranting and raving.

Meanwhile, Zanella began making his hatred of Manzoni ever more public.

“He’s a Jesuit,” Zanella declared. Then he was “unhinged.” Also “a sadist,” and “a coward.” Moreover, “he didn’t practice what he preached.” He even called him “a classic Italian intellectual.” And, finally, “he was not even his father’s real son.”

He also criticized Manzoni’s style: it was vulgar, crass, like a Lombard masquerading as a Tuscan. “And forget about his poetry!” he shouted at me one day. “How can we take someone seriously who penned words so banal as ‘Liberi non sarem se non siam uni’?” And then he demanded I repeat the line⁠—“Never shall we be free if not united”⁠—so that, like him, I would feel a shiver of disgust run up my spine.

“And what about the scene with Cecilia’s mother?” he bellowed, giving me a shove. He wanted me to trash Cecilia, the poor girl in The Betrothed who dies of the plague in one of the most heartbreaking scenes in all of world literature.

“Just listen to his description of her mother,” he said. “It’s his cloying use of the word but. Would you ever even for a moment think of writing something like this?”

And he began to quote from memory: “A woman whose appearance suggested a youth that was advanced but not yet passed. She radiated a beauty that was shrouded and dimmed but not ruined by great emotion and fatal languor … Her gait was weary, but not unsteady.” By the end he was shrieking, “How many times can one writer use the word but?”

He couldn’t stop picking apart Manzoni’s prose that day. At one point he quoted: “In her arms, she was holding the lifeless body of a little girl of about nine years of age.” And then he started to laugh like a madman. “See what I mean?” he said between guffaws. “ ‘About nine years of age’!” I didn’t see what he meant. So he explained it to me. “Either a child is nine years old or she isn’t. Nine is a precise age. If Manzoni wasn’t sure how old Cecilia was, he should have said ‘about ten.’ You can’t say ‘about nine years of age’! What does that even mean, ‘about nine years’?” He concluded, “Manzoni is bombastic, my friend. Extraordinarily bombastic.” Then he choked a little on his saliva and I had to run to get him a glass of water. 

For a few days following that angry outburst, he was calm. But then yesterday, when I was walking past his classroom, I saw a custodian peering through the keyhole, bent at a ninety-degree angle. When she heard me coming, she eagerly waved me over. “Hurry! Hurry!”

Zanella’s somber voice echoed clearly down the hall. “Descending from one of those doorways and moving toward the convoy came a woman …”

I was hesitant to accept the custodian’s invitation, but seeing the gleeful expression in her eyes, and under the pressure of her beefy hand on the nape of my neck, I bent down to take a peek. 

The class sat immobilized in an unnatural silence. Zanella had become Cecilia’s mother. 

It was a miracle. Although Zanella was well over fifty, his appearance suggested a youth that was advanced but not yet passed. Despite his bushy mustache and the fact that he was from Ascoli Piceno, he radiated the soft yet majestic beauty that once ran through Lombard blood. Great emotion and fatal languor somewhat shrouded and dimmed his handsome physique but did not ruin it. And he made his way from the radiator to the front row of desks with a gait that was weary, but not unsteady.

It didn’t seem real. The light that shone through the windows gave Zanella an ashen hue, as though he were a corpse being transported on a wagon. He was holding the lifeless body of a girl of about fifteen years of age; her messy hair was held in place with a large pink hair clip, and she was dressed in a pistachio-green shirt and a pair of jeans that were torn at the knee, revealing white stockings beneath. He held her not prone but upright, her chest leaning against his as though she were still alive. A pale and waxen little hand, with a ring on every finger and long nails painted purple, dangled lifelessly to one side. Her head rested on Zanella’s shoulder with an abandon more powerful than sleep.

The girl was Belinda Tiraboschi, and my colleague held her in his arms as he recited his lines. 

It was so moving I could hardly stand to watch. I wanted to step away from the door. But in part because the custodian (who could barely contain her laughter and couldn’t wait to share her amusement with me and with the principal) still had her hand on the nape of my neck, keeping my face glued to the keyhole, and in part because I simply didn’t have the strength to walk away, I stayed. And when Belinda’s mother turned to Francesco Solimano, who sat in the first row, and addressed him as if he were a loathsome corpse-collector, saying, “Sir, when you pass by here this evening, you will need to come upstairs to take me, too, and not just me,” I couldn’t hold back, and started to weep as if Belinda were my very own child."

    "text": "It must have been the summer of 2000 or maybe 2001 when I saw Ensign Wang guide a hedgehog across the road. The location, which I’m sure of, was the Y-shaped junction of Second and Third Avenues and Eleventh Street. The hedgehog was covered in short grayish-white bristles, and its tiny feet stuck to the newly laid tarmac. Ensign Wang loomed over it, legs firmly planted to block its way, blowing a tin whistle and waving the little yellow flag of a volunteer traffic officer. The hedgehog was too low to the ground to see any of this, but it seemed to grasp the message. Slowly turning its pointy face, it scurried eastward, hopped up onto the curb, and vanished into the undergrowth, abandoning Ensign Wang and the gridlocked streets.

I told Jade and her family this story the night we got engaged. I’d met Jade when I wandered into a bar while backpacking in Nice, saw a Chinese girl, and went over to talk to her. She was with a couple of female friends, all three of them already drunk. When she opened her mouth, her Northeastern accent was the same as mine. We found to our astonishment that we’d been born in the same place, Shenyang, and even at the same hospital. Three months later, at a seaside restaurant, a gentle breeze blew as Jade helped me translate the story of Ensign Wang and the hedgehog. Again and again, her French stepmother made a startled expression just a moment after her husband.

I was five and in my last year of preschool when I first learned that Ensign Wang was Eldest Uncle and Eldest Uncle was Ensign Wang. He was married to the eldest of my ba’s three sisters; my ba was an only son. My parents were both doing overtime at their respective factories, making parts for a giant float⁠⁠⁠—one tires, the other ball bearings⁠⁠⁠—to represent our province at the National Day celebrations in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Grandma was too busy smoking her pipe and playing mahjong with her old-lady neighbors to bother with picking me up from school, so instead she sent Ensign Wang, who happened to be at her place bringing her some anchovies.

I saw him outside and called, Hello, Eldest Uncle. He nodded in acknowledgment. An astonishingly tall man, he had to stoop to take my hand. In a rumbling voice he said, Don’t call me Eldest Uncle. Call me by my name, or else call me Ensign⁠⁠⁠—even our commissar calls me that. I said, It’s rude to call older p-p-people by their names, that’s what my ma says. Ensign Wang said, Manners are for common people, you don’t need them with me. I married your aunt, but that doesn’t change who I am. I said, Shouldn’t you be at w-work? Ma and Ba both are, and Ma says playing mahjong is Grandma’s job. Ensign Wang laughed. The hand that wasn’t holding mine held a cigarette, from which he now took a drag. I’m a military man, he said. I’m on family leave. I said, Oh, what kind of m-military man? He said, A navy submariner. Why are you stuttering?

We made the rounds of Youth Avenue and Eighth Street, stopping for a bowl of hand-pulled noodles. Along the way, Ensign Wang told me about the strange underwater creatures he’d seen from his submarine. I’ve forgotten most of them, except one that, despite its name, wasn’t actually a fish⁠⁠⁠—a giant cuttlefish that had wrapped its arms tightly around the submarine, holding it upright like a popsicle, when they were 3,800 meters underwater. Everything inside was flung around, and the crew tumbled one after another toward the nose. He said, Doesn’t that sound terrifying? I said, I don’t b-believe you. He said, Everything I saw was just like in that novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, by some French guy named Versailles. I used to think it was all made-up too. I’ll dig up the book when I get home and bring it for you next time. I said, Why didn’t you shoot a t-t-torpedo? Ensign Wang’s tobacco pouch was empty by then. He said, Our submarine only had nuclear weapons. If we’d fired, all the fish in the Pacific would have died, and the humans wouldn’t have lasted long either.

The sky was dark by the time we got back to Grandma’s house. I looked at the clock; it was nearly eight, and school finished at four thirty. Ma was back from work, and when I walked in the door with Ensign Wang, she grabbed me and said to him, Brother-in-Law, it’s been more than three hours. Did you take my son to Beijing? Ensign Wang laughed and said, Don’t forget to put the anchovies in the freezer, Ma. As he left, Ma grumbled to Grandma, Are you trying to kill me? You sent a lunatic to fetch my son. He’s not a lunatic, said Grandma. He’s a perfectly good man, the doctor said so.

I found out only later that when my ma called Ensign Wang a lunatic, she’d meant it literally⁠⁠⁠—he really was a mental patient. After that, I started noticing how, at our New Year’s family get-togethers, when my dad would book us a karaoke room at a local hotel, Ensign Wang would grab the microphone and refuse to let go, even sticking it in his pocket when he went to the bathroom in case someone tried to snatch it from him. Ensign Wang was happy when he sang, which meant he behaved himself. He had a good tenor voice, and did especially well with Yang Hongji’s or Jiang Dawei’s songs. He also liked drinking and writing poetry, and he played a mean game of chess⁠⁠⁠—he could do it while reading a book, moving the pieces with his feet. I’d seen his poems, though I didn’t understand them. They all had to do with the ocean.

As for his illness, I’d hear the story from Grandma every New Year’s Eve dinner. Ensign Wang had joined the navy when he was nineteen so he wouldn’t get sent down to the countryside, but despite his efforts he still got caught up in the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. There were a couple of years in the middle of all that when his ship’s crew was split into two factions, with the captain and the commissar each leading one. Not wanting to offend anyone, Ensign Wang refused to take sides. He was allowed to keep his allegiances murky because everyone understood his temperament: timid, earnest, stubborn. Yet because he was the best at his job as well as the most educated, both sides wanted to recruit him⁠⁠⁠—only they never could tell which way he was leaning. That was the root of the problem. One night, in his six-man bunk, Ensign Wang began talking in his sleep. In his resonant tenor voice, he called the captain a two-faced backstabber, then sneered that the commissar was a treacherous little rodent. Unfortunately for him, one of his bunkmates was an informant for the captain, and another for the commissar. They went to fetch their paymasters, who stood around wide-eyed, along with the other five men, listening to him curse and swear till dawn. The next day, the entire company canceled training and the factions came to a temporary truce to summon Ensign Wang to a struggle session. The captain said, Ensign, it turns out you’re a hypocrite, a traitor embedded within our forces. To think your father was an old revolutionary, with a hundred battles to his name. How will you ever look him in the eye? The commissar, like most commissars, was a man of few words. All he said was, Ensign Wang, you’re in for a world of punishment.

Ensign Wang was locked inside a tiny storeroom with a porthole so small the Pacific looked like a slick of water at the bottom of an urn. There was no bed, just a sheet of metal to sit on. A comrade snuck him cigarettes, which he chain-smoked for three days and nights. He never told anyone what else he went through in there, but by the time they let him out, his eyes were dead, the whites stained yellow from the tobacco. The company brought him back into the struggle session and he stood silent for a long time. At first, he just repeated the words, This shouldn’t have happened, should never have happened. After a pause, he went on, I’ve never talked in my sleep, let alone cursed at anyone. The commissar jumped to his feet and jabbed a finger at him: How could anyone know if they talk in their sleep? Ensign Wang cleared his throat and said into the mic, I’m a married man. If I talked in my sleep, my wife would have told me, wouldn’t she? Forget it, I’ll sing you guys a song, what would you like? Here, how about “Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman” …

 

 

My aunt was six months pregnant when she picked up Ensign Wang from Lüshun Port. They’d been introduced by a matchmaker when he was in his fourth year of service, and he visited home every six months after they married. This time, the first words out of his mouth when he saw her were: Xiuling, do I talk in my sleep? Without replying, my aunt gripped the ensign’s arm, put her hand on the back of his neck, and made him bow to the commissar. The commissar said, This isn’t the Party’s fault. My aunt said, I understand, his own mind is to blame. The commissar said, Even after you get him home, he shouldn’t stop self-criticizing. My aunt said, Message received. The commissar said, Most importantly, I hope you have a good birth. My aunt said, Thank you, sir.

After the commissar was overthrown by the captain, he went to an old wartime buddy, the foreman of an aircraft plant, and arranged for him to give the ensign a job. He’s not a bad comrade, said the commissar, he just made a mistake. Around the time Ocean turned three, Ensign Wang’s chance at a promotion slipped from his grasp as he welded the wing of a fighter jet. He’d forgotten to put on his protective mask, and sparks flew into his eyes. He fell from the ladder, and when he came to, he didn’t seem to recognize anyone. Once again he started to mumble, That shouldn’t have happened, should never have happened. When his eyes came back into focus, he could no longer look in any direction but straight ahead. My aunt came to get him from the factory, again with a big belly⁠⁠—a girl this time, whom they called Seagull.

The foreman didn’t want to fire him but worried he would disturb his coworkers, so he put him on sick leave. The ensign never recovered. For fifteen years they paid his wages, even after his old foreman died and was replaced. Only then did my aunt take Ensign Wang to see a doctor. We can ease his symptoms, but he’ll always be ill, the doctor said. The family will have to manage his mood swings.

I asked Eldest Aunt once why she hadn’t had him see a doctor sooner. She said if she’d done that, then he’d definitely have been sick, but as long as he stayed home, he might have been fine. But in fact she did ask someone to come take a look at her husband⁠⁠⁠—a woman around her age from Tieling, known to all as Guru Zhao⁠⁠⁠—soon after Seagull turned a month old. Third Aunt had said to her, Sis, let me introduce you to someone. I got to know her when I was sent down to the countryside. She brought Guru Zhao over from Tieling and took her straight to Eldest Aunt’s house. Grandma was there, clutching Seagull to her bosom. As the eldest son, my father had to be present, and all three aunts were there too, along with Ensign Wang himself, though he didn’t know who the visitor was. Second Aunt told Ocean, who was playing with his wooden building blocks, to go play outside.

Guru Zhao walked in and, without saying hello, strode up to the ensign, pulled up a stool, and sat across from him. She stared at him for a long time, not speaking. Behind her back, Third Aunt whispered to her big sister, Isn’t she something? We didn’t say a word, yet she knew right away who the patient was. Ensign Wang was perfectly calm. He brought his face closer to the guru’s and said, Your eyes are different sizes. Guru Zhao said, He’s not sick. Eldest Aunt said, Oh thank god. Guru Zhao said, But he has something following him. Third Aunt asked, What kind of something? Guru Zhao said, A vengeful spirit. Second Aunt asked, Who? Guru Zhao didn’t answer, but kept staring at Ensign Wang. She said, Have you ever killed anyone? Ba cried out, What nonsense is this? My brother-in-law was a sailor, not a bandit. Guru Zhao said, Everyone shut up. Have you killed anyone? Ensign Wang said, I’ve slaughtered pigs, and chickens too. During my years at sea, I killed fish every day. Guru Zhao said, You, stop talking, let the thing inside you speak. Ensign Wang fell silent.

Guru Zhao stared at the northeastern corner of the wall. It’s there, she said. Third Aunt asked, Where? Who? Guru Zhao said, Of course you can’t see it, only he and I can. Then she turned to Ensign Wang and said, A woman in her twenties, a scrawny little thing. Am I right? Ensign Wang was silent again. Guru Zhao said to Eldest Aunt, You should ask your old man. He has blood on his hands, and now his victim’s clinging to him. You two should go hash it out. When you’re done, come tell me. I’ll stay out here and have a chat with the spirit.

Eldest Aunt led Ensign Wang to the inner room and closed the door. Guru Zhao addressed the wall, her voice swooping high and low. Don’t you know who I am? You have a choice here. If you don’t leave, I have a spell that will deal with you. But if you’re willing to go, name your conditions and I’ll make sure the family gives you what you want. Second and Third Aunts felt a cold sweat prickle all over their bodies. After who knows how long, the door to the inner room opened and Eldest Aunt walked out alone. Guru Zhao said, Well? Did you get to the bottom of it? Eldest Aunt said, Yes. Guru Zhao said, Did someone die? Eldest Aunt said, He’s not a murderer, he’s only indirectly responsible. Guru Zhao said, But it matched my description. Eldest Aunt said, Yes, you were right. Third Aunt said to Second Aunt, I told you she was good. Guru Zhao said, Go on, tell me what happened. Eldest Aunt sat next to Guru Zhao, took a sip of tea, and said, He had another woman before he married me. She was from an intellectual family. He went off to join the navy after they got engaged. In ’67, her father was denounced and killed. Her mother tried to escape along the railway tracks, but it was dark and she didn’t see the train coming. It sliced her in two. 

Guru Zhao said, He has more than one creditor, no wonder my head hurts. Eldest Aunt went on, The girl had to go live with family in a farming village, with no way of getting in touch with the ensign. After a few years she managed to track him down and came looking for him at the port. We were already married by then. The girl went back to her village and got hitched to a pig slaughterer who beat her every day. Less than six months later, she jumped down a well and drowned. Eldest Aunt took another sip of tea. Second and Third Aunts filled their cups too, having sweated themselves dry. Guru Zhao said, When was this? Eldest Aunt said, Half a year before he got sick. Guru Zhao said, That’s about right. Are you sure he’s telling the truth? Eldest Aunt said, He wouldn’t lie. Guru Zhao said, That’s a family of three, this won’t be easy.

A few days later, Guru Zhao returned to Eldest Aunt’s house with two wooden tablets, a short one for the dead fiancée, inscribed with her surname, Chen, and a tall one with a longer name: Third Lord of the Bai Clan, Two Willows Cave on Dragon Head Hill. Guru Zhao had Eldest Aunt rearrange all the furniture against the eastern wall. The scroll-ended table was pushed up against it, with an incense holder in the center and behind it the tablets, one on either side. Guru Zhao said, Tell him to make offerings of incense morning and night, one joss stick for each tablet. He has to do it himself, no one can do it for him. Then Guru Zhao performed a ritual, scattering five pounds of incense ash everywhere. She bored a hole about the size of a thumb through the southwestern corner of the room, right out into the open air. Remember, she said to Eldest Aunt, don’t let the tunnel get blocked, clear it out from time to time. That’s how Third Lord Bai will come and go. 

The whole thing cost a whopping three hundred yuan. Before Guru Zhao left, Ensign Wang clutched her hand tight and said, If your name is Zhao, how come your family is Bai? Were you a foundling? Guru Zhao retrieved her hand and said to Eldest Aunt, You’ll have to be patient till he’s fully recovered. 

Ensign Wang went along with the whole rigmarole: maintaining the altar, scattering the incense ash, keeping the hole unblocked, doing everything himself. For a few months after the ritual, he took a turn for the better, his demeanor softened, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Even so, the grown-ups wouldn’t let any of us near him⁠⁠⁠—except me, as it turned out. In the summer of 1998, both my parents lost their jobs in the wave of mass layoffs sweeping our region. Ba was persuaded by a childhood buddy who’d also been fired to join him in setting up a small restaurant. What with having to find a space, renovate it, and apply for a business license, he was never home. And Ma asked Second Aunt, who worked for the Municipal Party Committee, to help find her a job, which meant she spent her days running around visiting various officials to present them with gifts. 

As a result, I was stuck at Grandma’s house the entire summer. Ensign Wang was always coming around when he got bored of beating the old man next door at chess. Grandma treated him like he was invisible. One day, she went off to play mahjong at someone else’s house, and he came in to hand me a book: Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. He said, I think I promised to lend this to you, when you were little. I got the author’s name wrong: Verne, not Versailles. I rubbed my finger across the title page, thin as a cicada’s wing. I said, When do you need it b-back? He said, No need, keep it. I said, The TV antenna is broken, I can’t watch Water Margin. Ensign Wang said, It’s fixable. I said, Fix it then. He said, Let me teach you to play chess first. I said, I already know how. He pulled something from his pocket: a magnetic chess set the size of a notebook. He unfolded it, laid out the pieces, spread his hands, and said, Your move. I said, You need to give me a handicap⁠⁠⁠—lose three pieces. He said, No way. I said, Then I’m not p-p-playing. He said, Two pieces. I stared at the board, agonizing about whether to take a horse and a chariot, or both cannons. When I looked up, Ensign Wang was standing in front of the television. He’d removed the rabbit ears and was gnawing on the end of the broken one. I said, Will that fix it? Still chewing, he came back to sit across from me and kept worrying away at the antenna as he played, moving the pieces with the tip of the good prong. He said, I didn’t see much of you last year. I said, I was in B-Beijing. He asked, What were you doing in Beijing? I said, Getting cured. He said, Straightening out that tongue of yours? 

In fact I had spent much of the previous year traveling back and forth to a little clinic in Shijingshan. I had the root of my tongue scorched by electrified pliers, drank a folk remedy made from boiled cricket exoskeletons, recited the alphabet with my mouth full of pebbles, and spat out bowl after bowl of dark blood. I had, by then, more or less resigned myself to a lifetime of humiliation. It was as if my parents were addicted to torturing me, or perhaps enjoyed suffering themselves.

I said I didn’t want to play anymore. Ensign Wang stood and placed the antenna back on top of the set, then turned on the TV. After a few minutes of snowstorm, the picture was back to normal. He said, It’s fixed. I said, The show’s over. He said, Look at the aerial. Have you noticed how it narrows? I said, So what? He said, We climb upward all our lives, until finally we’re at the tip, the narrowest point. I said, Where have you climbed to? He said, The turning point⁠⁠⁠—it’s all dust here. But you have to keep climbing. In this family, you and I have the most to say. Haven’t you realized? Even though you have trouble talking. 

By the end of the summer, Ba and his childhood friend had opened their restaurant, which did unexpectedly well. Ma had a new job too: temp warehouse supervisor at the operations office of the Women’s Federation. The job came without benefits, but it paid much better than the factory had. Our family grew more comfortable, and as we settled into our new life I had no reason to tell them about my secret meetings with Ensign Wang. 

 

 

I got drunk at the engagement party, and Jade had to help me back to the hotel. As I crashed into bed she blurted out, I don’t believe you. How could there be a hedgehog in a Chinese city, let alone on a main road? I said, You left Shenyang when you were two, of course everything there seems strange and comical to you. Not only did we have hedgehogs, I’ve eaten one. Jade just about lost her mind. What did you say? she yelped. You ate a hedgehog? You stutter when you’re drunk, I’m not sure I heard you right. We’re talking about those little creatures covered in spikes? I said, Yes, we ate one, me and Ensign Wang. It tasted like chicken.

It happened in the autumn, when I saw Ensign Wang’s illness flare up for the first time, triggered by my cousin Seagull. She had a boyfriend then, Li Guangyuan, who worked alongside her at the local pharmacy, dealing in Chinese medicine. He was eight years older, divorced with no children. Seagull, who’d never dated anyone before, was tall and pale, with huge eyes set in a little face, more or less the spit of Ensign Wang. When she got tired of politely turning Guangyuan down, she told him, My ba is a mental patient, and everyone says it’s hereditary. Guangyuan said, That can be cured. She said, You mean me? He said, I mean your ba, I’ll write him a prescription, he’ll be fine in half a year. Seagull said, My ba burns incense at home and prays to the immortals. The spiritualist said not to take medicine. Guangyuan said, That’s just superstition. We’re educated people. Let me take care of the meds, you won’t have to pay a cent.

Seagull really did sneak this medicine to Ensign Wang. Guangyuan brewed it at the clinic and bagged up the cooled mixture for her to bring home. She poured it into a thermos and told her father it was a tonic. He drank the stuff for six months. In the meantime, Seagull and Guangyuan got busy. One day, Seagull leaned across the counter and said, I’m pregnant. Come meet my parents. 

When Li Guangyuan stepped through the door, Ensign Wang was offering incense, telling Third Lord Bai about his day. He had a sore on his thigh that refused to heal, no matter what ointments he applied. It just kept getting bigger, until he could no longer walk properly. He hadn’t been downstairs in days. Ocean was there, too. He was a bus driver and still lived at home. Ensign Wang mumbled, I’ve reflected deeply on my wrongful thinking, and now I’ve reached a state of high enlightenment. I’m ready to get back on board the ship anytime. Eldest Aunt said, Are you praying to the commissar? Why don’t you shut up, your daughter’s got a bun in the oven. 

Guangyuan said, Hello, Uncle. Ensign Wang said, Call me by my name, I’m Ensign Wang. The stuff I drank, that was from you? Guangyuan said, Yes, how was it? Ensign Wang said, Bitter. Guangyuan said, All good medicine is bitter. Ensign Wang said, Are you scared of me? Guangyuan said, What’s there to be scared of? Ensign Wang said, They’re all scared of me. Guangyuan said, I’m not scared. Ensign Wang said, Is Seagull really pregnant? Guangyuan said, Almost four months. Ensign Wang said, Do you think that should have happened? Guangyuan said, I ought to have met her parents first, that’s on me. Ensign Wang said, Will you be able to care for her? Guangyuan said, Yes. Ensign Wang said, If you agree to something you can’t do, people might lose their lives. I’ve been there. Guangyuan said, That won’t happen. Ensign Wang said, Let’s have dinner next week. Guangyuan said, I’ll find us a spot. It was only when Ensign Wang turned to leave that Guangyuan noticed he was having trouble walking. He said, Uncle, what’s wrong with your leg? Ensign Wang said, I have a sore that won’t heal, I suspect it’s a problem with my thinking. Guangyuan said, I read somewhere that hedgehog flesh can cure sores.

Li Guangyuan was fond of Western fads, and instead of booking a restaurant, he threw a picnic at Youth Park. He laid out a two-meter square of blue gingham, and put out of a spread of roast chicken, chicken claws, pig trotters, sliced pork shoulder, cucumber salad, and summer radishes, with minced garlic and egg sauce in separate plastic containers, as well as four hot dishes he’d cooked himself, served in equal-size stainless steel lunchboxes. The food was arranged with such order and precision you knew at once he was a mensch. Guangyuan opened a bottle of soda for me and said, Drink up. Then he turned to my ma and asked, Would you like beer or soda, Auntie? She answered, Soda is fine, I’ll help myself. Guangyuan opened four bottles of Snow lager for Ensign Wang, my ba, Ocean, and himself, and as they toasted he said, From now on, we’ll be part of the same family. Bottoms up. With that, he emptied his bottle. As he opened a second one for himself, he said, I’m going to have to call you Ba from now on. Sit down, Ba. But Ensign Wang remained standing, because the sore on his thigh was flaring up again, and there was no way he could have sat cross-legged. He said, I can see farther standing up. 

The meal proceeded in silence. Only Ma tried to start a conversation with Guangyuan, about whether pearl powder dissolved in water could be used to whiten the skin. At some point, I felt Ensign Wang abruptly take my hand, and I let him lead me toward the hill behind us. No one seemed to notice the two of us slipping away. I remembered how Ensign Wang had come to pick me up from school when I was five, back when I was so short he had to bend to take my hand. Now he could stand up straight, but he walked with a limp. It took only a few paces to bring us into a pine thicket. A few shadows flitted between my legs: sparrows passing overhead. Out of nowhere, Ensign Wang yelped, Don’t move! Moving very fast, he stripped off his jacket and held it by the sleeves like a sling. He tiptoed forward, and before I could understand what I was seeing, he’d lunged like a cat and was down on one knee, clutching the jacket tightly. Wrapped in it was something about the size of a volleyball, wriggling. He brought the bundle over to me, and for the first time in my life I saw a live hedgehog. He said, Touch it. I reached in and brushed my palm over its spikes. They weren’t as sharp as I’d imagined. I asked, Are we going to bring it home and keep it as a pet? He said, Go fetch some twigs. I said, It eats twigs? He said, It’s not eating anything, I am. I did as I was told. 

By the time I came back with the twigs, he’d dug a shallow pit into the ground, in which he’d spread a layer of dried-up leaves. Small flames were already dancing around them. He said, Put these down and add them to the fire one by one. As I brushed the dirt off my shirt, I said, Where’s the hedgehog? Ensign Wang pointed to a clump of soil at his feet, the size of a basketball. In there, he said. I was scared now, but all I could do was watch as the flames grew higher. 

Ensign Wang set the ball of dirt down amid the leaves, and kept the fire going by tossing more twigs in. The sun was about to set and the flock of sparrows returned, settling in the branches overhead, watching. Ensign Wang let the flames die down, waiting patiently till the last ember was extinguished. With a forked stick, he rolled the charred clod of soil to the edge of the pit, then stood up and brought his leg down hard. It cracked like an egg, and a strange aroma wafted from the white meat within: no spikes, no limbs, just a clump of flesh. Ensign Wang knelt down and blew on it till it had cooled a little. He ripped off a strip and brought it to my mouth. I didn’t struggle. I chewed once, twice. Ensign Wang said, You’re not ill, one mouthful will do. He scooped up a large chunk, then another, and another. There was nothing left but a pile of bones. In the moonlight, it looked like a chicken carcass.

Voices were calling our names, drawing closer. Ensign Wang brushed off the seat of his trousers and took my hand again. We walked out from among the pine trees, our footsteps quick. Only then did I feel life return to my body. I looked up at the angular line of Ensign Wang’s chin, and understood that he was having an episode. And yet his leg really did seem to have improved.

 

 

Seagull’s marriage didn’t bring Ensign Wang good luck. Instead, his sickness began flaring up more and more often. Soon after his granddaughter, Muyang, was born, Seagull fell ill too, and her milk dried up. Eldest Aunt’s workplace had been in the process of making her redundant, but instead she took early retirement and stayed home to care for the child, so Seagull could concentrate on getting better. This meant she could no longer keep an eye on Ensign Wang, who’d started running around everywhere, no longer bothering to offer incense. The neighbors reported that he’d stopped playing chess and instead would go up to the roof and lean over the railing, staring down seven stories at the players. They’d look up and there he’d be, eyes fixed on them. It was terrifying. What if he jumped and smashed his head right into the chessboard? Eldest Aunt did nothing, even though people urged her to put Ensign Wang in the hospital for a while. She retorted, What hospital? If he dies, it’ll be here, under my watch.

By then, though, Eldest Aunt had run out of steam. She caved and called Guru Zhao. Before she’d said a word, Guru Zhao spoke: I knew it was you⁠⁠⁠—my noggin started throbbing when the phone rang. Is your old man sick again? Eldest Aunt said, Wow, you’re good. It’s worse this time, I’m worried he might die. Guru Zhao cut in, Don’t tell me his symptoms, tell me what the matter is. He must have done something bad again. Eldest Aunt said, Uh, let me think, oh yes⁠⁠⁠—six months ago, he caught a hedgehog, roasted it, and ate it. There was a long silence. Eldest Aunt said, Hello? Are you still there? A shriek came over the phone: Just you wait for your whole family to die! Eldest Aunt was furious. Aren’t you supposed to be a healer? How could you say such a thing? Guru Zhao roared, Don’t you know who’s been protecting your family all these years? Don’t you know who I am? The lords of the Bai family are my fathers!

Eldest Aunt was stunned into silence. That night, she said to Guangyuan, You studied Chinese medicine. Do you know who Third Lord Bai is? Guangyuan said, The five great immortal clans are Hu, Huang, Bai, Liu, and Hui⁠⁠⁠—the fox, the weasel, the hedgehog, the snake, and the mouse. Eldest Aunt said, Oh, so the hedgehog is Guru Zhao’s father. Guangyuan said, Whose father? Eldest Aunt shook her head. Guangyuan said, Ma, I didn’t want to say anything before I became part of this family, but I have to speak up now. Father-in-Law should be in a hospital. Eldest Aunt said, I’ll think about it. He said, And get rid of those tablets, that’s not the right move. She said, I have to get rid of them anyway, your father-in-law ate her ba. She replaced the tablets with a wall-mounted Jesus on a cross and announced she was turning Christian. I once saw her kneeling before the crucifix, sobbing as she prayed.

 

 

The last time I saw Ensign Wang, I went to visit my aunt and noticed that the cross was gone. She gave her chest a thump and said, The chaos in here has lifted. Outside was a white van, and my uncle was bent over, climbing into the back of it. Li Guangyuan was stuffing a bundle of banknotes into the hands of the two orderlies, I couldn’t see how much. When they were done, the orderlies got in too. As they pulled the doors shut behind them, I felt a sudden urge to shout Ensign Wang or else Eldest Uncle, but I didn’t. His body was blocked by one of the white coats, and his head was turned away. 

Jade asked me how Ensign Wang died. It was a sudden heart attack, I said. An aide was ladling out his breakfast congee, and by the time she turned back around, his head was slumped on the windowsill, like he was taking a nap. Jade said, Old people in France envy deaths like that, with no suffering. I said, So do people all over the world. Jade suddenly changed the subject: Why didn’t you tell me before that you had depression as a kid? I said, I’m sorry. She said, It’s not your fault, and anyway it wasn’t really depression, was it? I said, I don’t know. But I remembered then that, when I saw Ensign Wang guiding a hedgehog across the road, I was fourteen, and yes, it was 2001. I ought to have been in my second year of junior high, but instead was stuck in elementary. I’d been so mercilessly teased for my stutter that by the age of ten I’d withdrawn completely into myself and refused to go to school. After a year of treatments in Beijing, I returned without any change to my stutter, only I was one grade behind everyone else. I’d been an okay student, but now I hated studying, and my grades plummeted. They kept me back another year. On my fourteenth birthday, I stood with one foot out the window of our sixth-floor apartment, ready to end it all. That’s when my parents agreed to stop trying to cure me. As I stepped down from the sill, I made up my mind never to speak to anyone again. I was mute for three months, and no matter how my parents or anyone else tried, they couldn’t prize a single word from my lips. Tears fell down my mother’s face constantly, and when she got tired of weeping, she took me to see a psychiatrist. I refused to speak to the shrinks, of course, so their diagnosis was depression, but there was no way to treat that without talking. 

In the end, Third Aunt convinced my parents that I must have been cursed, and we decided to call on Guru Zhao for the third time. Guru Zhao insisted that I come alone and that we meet at Eldest Aunt’s house, because the hole in the southwest corner was still there and Third Lord Bai would be able to come and go freely. My mother put me in a taxi, told the driver the address twice, and handed over the fare, weeping as she sent me on my way. We were almost at Eldest Aunt’s when we got caught in the traffic jam caused by Ensign Wang and the hedgehog.

I hadn’t seen the ensign for some time, because after we disappeared into the pine grove, my parents said they’d break my legs if I went near him again. Eldest Aunt, who couldn’t yet bring herself to have him locked up by strangers, had chosen instead to keep him under house arrest, feeding him sleeping pills that she ground into powder and dissolved in water. Ensign Wang obediently gulped down a glassful of this concoction every morning and evening, and spent all day and night asleep. He was conscious no more than two hours a day, just long enough to eat a meal and take himself to the bathroom for a piss. But that day Muyang had a fever, and in Eldest Aunt’s rush to bring her granddaughter to the clinic, she forgot to give Ensign Wang his sleeping pill. 

By the time I caught up with Ensign Wang and Eldest Aunt, his whistle had been engulfed by a tide of honking horns, though his cheeks still bulged as he blew. Two old women ran over and at almost the same moment caught hold of his collar from behind. One of them grabbed the whistle and flag, while the other, my aunt, restrained the man himself. Someone had called the police, and my aunt was hustling to get her husband home before the community officers arrived. When Ensign Wang saw me, he smiled. Ah, you’re here! I said nothing. He said, Hasn’t your tongue been straightened out yet? Have you gone mute? I glared at him, teeth gritted.

I followed as Eldest Aunt dragged Ensign Wang all the way home. He no longer had his flag and whistle, but he was in high spirits. When the three of us got to Eldest Aunt’s house, we were hit with a blast of incense smoke as soon as we entered. Third Lord Bai’s tablet was back in its place on the altar. Guru Zhao was in a yellow robe, wielding a short wooden sword. Ensign Wang, still jubilant, cried out, Hello, old friend! Guru Zhao pointed the sword at him and said, You and the Bai family are mortal enemies! Don’t let me see you again! Then, moving the sword to point at my aunt, she said, You too! Ensign Wang smiled and said, I saved a member of your family today, can’t we call it quits? Guru Zhao bellowed, Scram! Eldest Aunt hustled Ensign Wang into the inner room, and locked herself in there too. 

Guru Zhao pointed the sword at me and said, Get over here. Kneel to the Third Lord. A strange force propelled me forward and brought me to my knees. Above me was the spirit tablet of the Third Lord of the Bai Clan, Two Willows Cave on Dragon Head Hill. My teeth clenched, I felt a thwack on the back of my head, and heard Guru Zhao scream, Speak! My mouth remained shut. Another thwack from the sword. Speak! And when I didn’t, another blow. My skull was on fire. Third Lord Bai is here! You have to confess! Still I said nothing, but suddenly, from the inner room, came Ensign Wang’s voice. Climb! he hollered. You have to climb, climb to the tip of life! I looked up, and there was Guru Zhao in front of me. Climb! Keep climbing! The ensign’s cries were louder now, and I could hear a scrabbling at the door. 

My mouth opened and I screamed, I’m a sinner! She shouted, What sin? Speak! I screamed, I defied my parents! She screamed, What else? Speak! And just like that, tears poured from my eyes. Guru Zhao screamed, Say it! Your uncle’s already confessed! I screamed, I confess, I ate a hedgehog! She screamed, Again! I screamed, I ate the immortal flesh of the Bai clan! She screamed, You brute! But you’re young and ignorant, Third Lord Bai will spare your life. Repeat after me! First the Hu and then the Huang! And I repeated, First the Hu and then the Huang! Next the python and the Chang! Next the python and the Chang! Then the judge and demons fetch! Then the judge and demons fetch! Third Lord Bai come save this wretch! Third Lord Bai come save this wretch! The sword came down again, forcing out the blood swirling around my mouth. A bag of incense ash rained down on my head, enveloping me in fog. I felt as if a heavy burden had been lifted, and I could no longer hear Ensign Wang’s cries.

    "text": "It was one of those midsummer Sundays when everyone goes around saying, “It’s just too hot.” 

“Muy caliente,” say the men mowing the lawns.

“Slishkom zharko,” says the valet parking cars.

“Hot as F,” says the woman working the drive-through window at El Pollo Loco.

Walter is up high in the hills, lying on a chair, looking at the sky. He is thinking about the view from an airplane descending over the mountains, across Big Bear and Arrowhead and through the clouds to the high-rises of downtown, the Hollywood sign, In-N-Out Burger, houses big and small, and then the pools, so many pools. 

The topography of the LA Basin keeps the dirt in, warm air on top of cool. By midafternoon the sky will be tinged with a haze that turns the air orange and brown and hangs until sunset, when there is the illusion that it is gone, but you can feel it with every breath you take, you can taste it.

Walter tilts his head back, bringing Cheryl’s legs and the house beyond into view. Upside down and backward⁠—this POV fits perfectly with something fundamental in his experience. His own house, his parents’ house, is downhill from here⁠—six and eight-tenths of a mile down. Yesterday, when he told Cheryl that he would come for a swim, he was sure he’d be home in time for dinner. But by the time they’d been in and out of the pool and eaten lunch, he didn’t have the energy to leave. It was literally too hot to be outside, like being at the center of something about to explode, so they went into the basement and lay on the concrete floor and googled things. Hottest day in history: July 10, 1913, Death Valley, 134 degrees.

Later, after sundown, they went outside. 

“There are no stars,” he said.

“If you want stars, just go down the block, the neighborhood is crawling with them,” she said, before pausing to survey the night sky, faraway airplanes and satellites blinking in the distance. “Is there something you long for?” she asked. “Is there something you want, something you need, whatever it might be?”

“Snow,” he said. “Or maybe innocence. I wish I could go back in time and discover myself anew, or have a do-over, something like that.”

“Me too,” she said, exhaling heavily.

“I know,” he said. The specter of her younger brother Billy’s death from a snakebite a couple of years ago hovers over everything like an atmospheric anomaly.

Walter listens to the sloshing of the weir, a.k.a. the flap⁠—the sound in the mouth of the skimmer that indicates things are working well. Depending on the weather, the wind, the height of the water, the sound is sploshier or more clicky. Cheryl is lying at the edge of the pool, one hand in the water, mumbling, “Water, we are mostly water.” 

They are each other’s mirror, laboratory, test subject. Whatever they will offer the world they try out first on each other. Walter is soothing, she drinks him like water. His skin is white as a cumulus cloud but plagued with eruptions of all kinds. 

“What is that?” she asks, pointing to a small black spot on his leg. “A birthmark?” 

“Dirt,” he says, flicking it away. “My legs are too skinny.”

“A lot of men have thin legs,” she says.

“My ankles are like wrists,” he says. “And my calves are nothing.” 

Walter has always been uncomfortable in his skin. He wonders when it started, whether it began as soon as he emerged enrobed in his milky amniotic sac. He used to tell people “I was born with a caul,” but then realized they thought he meant a calling⁠—a spiritual summons to become something, like a priest or a soldier.

“I am definitely feeling the heat,” he says, turning his chair so that his back is facing where the sun would be if they could see it through the haze.

“Well, I hope they are feeling it too,” Cheryl says, turning her chair as well. 

“Who is ‘they’?” he asks.

“The people who ruined the planet,” she says.

“We are the people who ruined the planet,” he says. 

“I definitely did not ruin the planet,” she says. 

“You definitely did,” he says.

“Okay, well, if I did, I didn’t mean to, like, I didn’t know I was doing it at the time. I wasn’t fully conscious of the effects.”  

“At a certain point are we not also responsible for our consciousness?” Walter asks.

This is the kind of question Cheryl doesn’t like; it asks a lot of a person⁠—both opinion and accountability. She tugs at the straps of her bathing suit. For the entirety of her life, Cheryl has been in a war with her clothing, nothing feels right, nothing fits right. 

“Are we on fire?” Sylvia, the mother, shouts from inside the house. “I’m suiting up.”

“I don’t know,” Walter says. “There’s smoke on the horizon, and where there’s smoke …”

Sylvia steps out, swathed in zinc oxide. She looks like a mineral-based ghost. Her husband, Ben, follows her. She turns to him. “What are you doing? You can’t just go out like that, unprotected.”

“I’m just going out to tell them to come indoors,” Ben says, gesturing at Cheryl and Walter. “It’s scalding out here. I was supposed to play golf, but part of the freeway collapsed.”

Abigail, the eldest, slips past her parents and hovers like a beam of steel over the lounge chair where Cheryl is laid out. 

“Get up,” she says to her sister. “I need your chair.”

For some reason there are only two. Blame the landscape architect who didn’t want things to look cluttered.

“It’s too hot to lie on the flagstone,” Cheryl says. “I’ll fry like an egg.” 

“You can sit on the grass,” Abigail suggests.

“The blades are too sharp. It was just mowed.”

Abigail hands Cheryl a towel. 

“I need more,” Cheryl says, and Abigail hands her another. Where Abigail is long and lean to the point of emaciation, Cheryl is what in LA they would call chunky. 

Ben opens the umbrella and adjusts it so that both girls are protected. He stands over Abigail. “You look like I don’t make enough money to feed you,” he says.

“You’re not supposed to say that,” Abigail says. “You should talk to the psychiatrist. Mother, tell him to talk to Dr. Felt.”

“Do you want Esmeralda to bring you some lunch?” Sylvia asks.

“Just water,” Abigail says. “When the weather is like this, everything is an effort. Even this empty glass is so heavy.”

“Splash yourself,” the father says. 

“Make ice cubes,” Abigail says. 

“It’s blistering,” the mother says.

“I’m melting,” Cheryl says. “Literally turning to liquid. Look at me, water is pouring out of my body.” In contrast to other young women, who get dewy or glow when they are heated, Cheryl forms little round balls of sweat. 

“Was it hot like this when you were growing up?” Walter asks Ben, who is looking out over the city. 

Ben turns to Walter. “When we built this house no one wanted to live up here, but in my eyes, this was freedom. When it all goes to shit, when what is beneath us is crushed, we will come out on top.”

“What sign are you?” Abigail asks Walter. She is turning the pages of a magazine, ripping out the scented perfume cards and inhaling each one deeply before sailing them onto the grass like small frisbees.

“Pisces,” Walter says.

“A water sign,” Sylvia says. “You’ve been a fish for as long as I’ve known you, Walter. It’s your body type. You’re a triangle. There are triangles, and rectangles, and pears like Ben.”

Last year, Walter’s swim coach got a grant to have the body compositions of everyone on the team examined, scanned, and analyzed four different ways. The scientists running the study discovered that Walter’s fat was a little different, physiologically, from the other boys’⁠—more like Guðlaugur Friðþórsson’s, an Icelandic fisher-man who was the sole survivor of a 1984 shipwreck. Friðþórsson swam for six hours in forty-two-degree water and walked for miles barefoot before reaching safety. Walter had never heard of Friðþórsson but found the information oddly comforting; it confirmed something he’d always secretly believed. 

“What are you?” Cheryl asks her mother.

“Hourglass,” Sylvia says. “Like sands through the hourglass, these are the days of our lives.”

“That’s beautiful,” the father says.

“I’ve been thinking about your situation,” Abigail tells Walter. “I’m going to get you a DNA test for your birthday. You’ll see you’re not alone.”

“I never said I was alone.”

“But you’re an only child,” Abigail says.

“Maybe not,” Walter says. 

“If it were me, I would need to know where I came from,” Abigail says. When there’s not enough going on, she makes trouble. And because her family is tormented by the fragility of her mental health, they never tell her to knock it off. “A DNA test would answer some questions. For example, do you know who you are?”

None of this is new, the needling, the effort to get under his skin, using him as the relief valve. The only difference is that today what is usually annoying has become insufferable. It can’t continue. 

“Is who I am dependent on where I came from?” Walter asks.

“This conversation is making me even hotter,” Cheryl says. 

“Well, I know things about you, Walter,” Sylvia says, trying to lower the temperature. “I’ve known you since before you knew yourself.”

“I don’t need a DNA test to know who I am,” Walter says, abruptly standing. “I gotta go.” 

“You’re leaving?” Cheryl asks, surprised.

“Yes.”

“For how long?” Cheryl turns to her family and announces,  “The audience is leaving.”

“I don’t think you should leave,” the mother says. “It’s not a day when anyone should do anything beyond the absolutely necessary.”

“Thank you, but I need to,” Walter says.

“You’re leaving me here, alone with them?” Cheryl asks.

“Do you even want to know why I’m asking?” Abigail says, before Walter can reply. “I’m asking because sometimes I wonder if maybe I’m adopted. Like maybe no one told me.” Everyone is silent. “What?” Abigail feigns upset. “It’s actually a common thing⁠—wondering if you’re adopted.”

A moment passes.

“I’m not sure that’s okay,” Cheryl says. “You’re appropriating the experience of others.”

“Do you want a ride home?” Sylvia says. “Esmeralda can drive you.”

“No,” he says.

“Well, how will you get there?” Cheryl asks.

“I’ll swim,” Walter says. And as soon as he says it, he knows that’s exactly what he’ll do.

“Where will you begin?” the mother asks.

“Next door,” he says. The Bensingers are always somewhere else, Aspen or Santa Fe. Walter hurries to put on his shoes and walks across the lawn, heading for the gate.

“You’re not going to use the front door?” Ben asks.

“Nope.”

“What about water for the road?” Sylvia calls after him.

Walter doesn’t respond.

“I think he’s really mad,” the father says. 

“His feelings are hurt,” Cheryl explains.

They talk loudly as Walter walks away, as if he can’t hear them.

When he reaches the gate at the side of the yard, he raises his arm and waves without turning. He cannot allow himself to look back.

“Ciao,” says Abigail. “Hasta la vista.”

Walter is in the narrow gully between properties. He keys himself into the Bensingers’ yard, 1-2-3-4-#, to loud beeps.

“How does he know the code?” the father asks. 

“We all use the same one,” Sylvia says. “It’s easier for the pool boys.”

On the other side of the fence, Walter takes his shirt and shoes off and hurls himself at the water, a giant cannonball off the deep end. The splash is loud, like flushing a toilet, an audible fuck you to the family next door.

“We can hear you,” Abigail calls out.

The minute Walter hits the water, his anger and frustration break off like a crust. He is underwater, eyes closed, in another world. Even though they are just across the fence, he is filled with nostalgia and longing. He has done the thing that they can no longer do. He has taken action. He remembers when it seemed like they were the ones who had everything, who could do anything. He is remembering when Sylvia hired a company to make snow in July. The workers arrived before dawn and produced a sled-worthy hill and enough extra to roll a two-ball snowman and hurl a few snowballs before it all turned to mush. Walter also remembers confessing to her once, when he was stoned, that she reminded him of Mrs. Robinson from The Graduate. “I’ve always been fond of you too, Walter,” she said, looking him so squarely in the eye that he had to turn away.

“Are you even allowed to swim unsupervised?” Abigail yells, trying to get a rise out of him. “Everyone needs a lifeguard.”

“He is a certified lifeguard,” Cheryl says.

The water is so warm it feels thick like gel. His arms slice through, clean and clear. He’s not going fast, just warming up. Walter in water is Walter in his element.

He has been swimming for so many years that he is attuned to shifts in pH. Below 7.2, the water is too acidic, it stings the eyes and corrodes the pool equipment; too high and it’s slippery and tastes like baking soda. The pH of amniotic fluid is 7.1 to 7.3. 

Is he swimming away from or toward something? He is at a point in his own evolution where he is neither bound nor free. He wants to be past it and yet never to be an adult. He wants never to be an old man with skinny, hairless legs. He is swimming downhill, backward through time. 

He emerges from the water, picks up his T-shirt, puts on his shoes, and, dripping wet, crosses the street to a house to which over the years he has been dispatched many times to retrieve items that have sailed, floated, drifted, careened, or crashed into the yard. Something about the steep slope, the topography of the hills, and the local air currents makes it inevitable that anything escaping Cheryl’s familial lot lands in this direction: kites, frisbees, soccer balls, footballs, remote-controlled toys, a Stomp Rocket, and the family dog, who, as a puppy, had a pole vaulter’s skill for jumping the fence. The fences and the angle of the land make recovery difficult, and so Walter always had to go the long way around, ring the doorbell, and inform the neighbors of the incursion. Finally they showed him where the spare gate key was hidden, and then whenever he was sent on a recovery mission he would swim a lap or two⁠—just because.

This pool is surrounded by a kind of Japanese-style garden of irregularly shaped stepping stones set in a shallow bed of round pebbles. When he swims here, Walter has the habit of putting one pebble at the edge of the pool for each lap he swims. Four pebbles in, as he’s turning his head to breathe, he notices someone in a fringed bikini and large pink sunglasses looking at him through the kitchen window. Walter recognizes the pattern of a Pucci bikini. He knows more than he wants to know about women’s bathing suits, thanks to Abigail, who has taught him about patterns and cuts and what hides what.

“Hello, Pebble Boy,” the person calls out.

“Is it okay that I’m swimming?” Walter asks.

“If ever there was a day that called for a swim, it’s today,” the person says. “Would you like a glass of orange juice? I squeeze it myself.”

“Sure,” Walter says.

“Keep going and I’ll bring it out,” the person says.

Walter does another lap, and the person meets him at the shallow end and hands him a glass. The juice is sweet, plump with pulp, and poured over ice. Walter drinks it slowly. It’s a delicious elixir, and he can feel his cells taking it in. He had no idea how depleted he was.

“I use three kinds of orange⁠—Valencia, Washington navel, and blood orange. And I grate just a tiny bit of ginger in. On a day like this, all I can do is juice.”

“It’s perfect,” Walter says. “May I ask, what happened to the guy who used to live here?” 

“She is me,” the person says, smiling. “I know you from before.”

“From before what?” Walter asks.

“Before this.” She gestures to her long hair and bikini top. “Can you believe I am fifty years old and just now growing boobs?”

“With apologies,” Walter says. “I didn’t recognize the revised version.”

She laughs. “Sometimes we morph to conform to society, sometimes to welcome our truth. You can call me Marcie,” she adds, which reminds him that her name used to be Matt or Michael or Mark.

“I’m Walter.”

“I know. And you put the pebbles in a pile, a pebble for every lap.” Marcie goes into the pool-supply bench and pulls out a glass jar half-filled with pebbles. “I keep them. I’m not sure why, but here they are.” Marcie shakes the jar.

Walter smiles. “That’s very cool, thank you.”

“Swim here whenever you like, it makes me happy to see someone in the water. And remember, Walter, be yourself, not who others want you to be.”

“Congratulations on your new life, Marcie,” Walter says, leaving one extra pebble at the end, for the lap not yet swum. He takes a deep breath and goes underwater until he reaches the other end.

Walter knows the pools not by their owners’ names but by the stories he’s heard about them. There is the house of the movie star, the drug dealer, the game show hostess, the barking dog, the lottery winner, the house that gives out full-size candy bars at Halloween, the house where the bad thing happened even if no one can remember what the bad thing was⁠—Walter thinks maybe the family got locked inside their own safe room and couldn’t be found for several days.

Along the way, some properties are less welcoming than others. There are signs: UNDER SURVEILLANCE and THE OWNER OF THIS PROPERTY IS ARMED. One house has a six-hole putting green. Another has a running track around the perimeter of the yard. There are pools easily accessed with simple commands. “Alexa, open the gate.” “Siri, are you here?” “Google gods, let me in.” Clap three times and the gate pops open.

“What’s goin’ on?” a guy asks as Walter slips through the bushes. Walter’s T-shirt catches on the fence, briefly pulling him backward before letting go with a guttural rip. “Are you feeling it?” the guy asks. “When I’m inside, it’s cold like a meat locker and I’m thinking I’m dead and in a storage facility waiting to be buried and then I come out here and I can’t breathe. I can’t get a decent bite of air, and the vultures are circling. Am I next?” He speaks in a rush of words like he’s been starved for contact. “Do you want to come in and watch a movie? Do you want to get high? I’ve got mushrooms, shatter, glue, glass, weed.”

“I appreciate the offer,” Walter says, “but I have to keep moving. Do you know what size your pool is? How many laps make a mile?”

“I used to know but I forget,” the man says. “I think maybe it’s like twenty-five miles an hour?”

“I’m just gonna do a lap or two and then drift downstream,” Walter says, pulling his shirt over his head and examining the six-inch tear.  

“I could fix that for you,” the guy says. “I learned how to knit in rehab. I could knit that back just the way it was.”

“No worries,” Walter says, getting into the water.

The guy watches him swim. “You are beautiful, man,” the guy says. “Effing beautiful.”

Walter emerges, then circles back to the other end of the pool to pick up his T-shirt and shoes, resenting the interruption of his journey. The next house is always for sale; it has been bought and sold multiple times in the past few years and is on the market again. It may have bad feng shui, but the pool is immaculate. The under-water cleaning machine, a pool octopus, senses Walter’s presence and begins wrapping itself around his limbs. Walter extracts himself, sets the machine on the grass, and continues swimming.

Floating on his back, Walter is his own horizon line, a human level, balanced, smoothly stroking backward until he hears a kind of choking sound. The pool octopus has crawled across the lawn and attached its tentacles to a tree, the weighty center of the unit banging against the trunk as if trying to mount it in an ill-fated attempt at reproduction. The underwater speakers are playing Lou Reed’s “Walk on the Wild Side.” “Doo, do-doo, do-doo, do-do-doo.”

Walter crosses the street, shirt in hand, his suit still dripping, his footprints evaporating behind him as he walks. 

As he’s between houses someone calls out, “Beware the rays. Slather yourself. It’s too much, it’s all too much.”

It is so hot that it is hard to walk but even more difficult to stand still. The sun is at full strength and the ground is holding so much heat that it feels as if he’s inside a sandwich press.

A little farther downhill, a woman is packing her hybrid tea rose bushes in ice. “My friend in La Cañada called to tell me that her grapes are turning into raisins on the vine. It’s so confusing for them,” she says. “You have to water deep and train the roots to dig in, otherwise there’s no chance of survival. Even my bougainvillea is wilting.”

Walter takes a detour to a house he’s always admired. The house is old, hacienda-style, the gate is open. A tile path draws Walter in, past a fountain and toward an underpass leading to the pool. 

“We were just having lunch,” an older woman calls out from the arched terrace above.

“It’s so hot,” he says. “Would it be all right …” Walter gestures to the pool. “I was just going to swim across. I’ve always really admired your house. It’s beautiful.”

“Thank you. I bought it about a hundred years ago, right before some asshole was going to tear it down to build something that now would be called midcentury. Aren’t you hungry? We can bring you a plate.”

“I’m fine, thanks,” he says, before diving in.

Each pool tastes vaguely different⁠—salty, bitter, bleachy, blanched. By the time he is at the other end, a plate, a cloth napkin, and a bottle of mineral water have materialized. On the plate is a crustless sandwich cut in half and a handful of ridged potato chips. Not wanting to get crumbs in the pool, he climbs out.

“Sustenance,” he calls. “Thank you.”

“It’s all about the bread,” the woman says. “Without good bread it’s nothing.”

The next pool is deep and dark and reminds him of lakes and ponds. His suit is starting to chafe. With no one in sight, he slips out of his trunks and into the water. He is a young boy back at camp, swimming naked in the lake⁠—first tadpole, then minnow, then guppy. Somewhere between guppy and lionfish, each boy was issued a pair of navy blue swim trunks with his name sewn into the band. For the rest of that summer a sense of shame hung over the lake. 

As he swims, Walter casts himself as an explorer, a pilgrim nostalgic for a time that never was.

He imagines he is swimming not just home but south for the winter, north for the spring, and then back out west again. The Pacific Ocean is almost two hundred million years old, and he knows that some part of him is of that ocean. 

In a short and shallow pool he should have skipped, Walter swims back and forth, thrashing frantically like a whale at SeaWorld. Is it really a surprise that if one keeps an apex predator for decades in what is essentially a bathtub, asking it to turn tricks for its dinner, it will lose its mind? 

He bumps his head hard on the wall while doing a flip turn, then scrapes his shin on the coping and bright red blood spills into the water. Walter stops to examine his leg, bending to lick the wound. The metallic tang of blood is diluted by a chlorine rinse. He wonders what Cheryl is doing right now. Is she, are they, still sitting by the pool? Are they talking about him?

At the next house, there are a grotto, a bower, and a canal to swim through. Underwater he hears sounds, either the thrum of the city or of the earth under pressure. There are subterranean streams feeding the Río de Los Ángeles, which flows from the Simi Hills and empties into the San Pedro Bay. In its natural state it created alluvial floodplains but it is now a fixed concrete channel cutting through the metropolis. This is the information he takes solace in⁠—data about what is naturally occurring and what is man-made. The river’s sounds are deep and melancholic, like the drone of an ancient cello. Walter feels the vibrato inside his head.

Scorching. Despite being in the water, Walter is dehydrated. He is thinking he is at Big Bear Lake, surrounded by evergreens and aspens, cottonwoods and oaks, sweet gums and Koelreuteria bipinnata in all their glory. He is trying to remember what month it is, and he is imagining arroyo lupines, fuchsia sasanqua camellias, and roses of all varieties. 

He climbs over the fence, back to the street. Molten. The soles of his feet are blistered. The toe of his left sneaker is torn, the lace of the right is missing. As he crosses the arterial road, the hazards of LA traffic become clear. On the shoulder there is a dead animal, its innards exuviated, its skin so flattened and dry that he can’t tell what it is or was.

It used to be that if you stepped off a curb everyone stopped. Now the cars just go around you, they look at Walter like he is an apparition or one of those stick-figure inflatables outside a car wash or tire store, waving like a puffed-up straw man.

A car slows, pulls up next to him, the window rolls down; an air-conditioned cloud of cigarette smoke slips out. “You need a ride?” Behind the car, a truck leans on its horn. Walter shakes his head no and waves the vehicle on. His wave is the same stroke as his crawl, his arm heavy through the air.

There is a change in the weather, a darkness on the horizon. Leaves are falling into the next pool. The trees are drained of color. There is the smell of chestnuts roasting. He is looking at the hills as the first plane comes in and expels a single puff of white smoke. And then a larger plane comes in low and dumps a load of pink slurry that moves through the air like a curtain unfurling in front of him. Phos-Chek, flame retardant, stains the sky red. The spray drifts over Walter and clings to his skin.

He thinks of the coyote who comes to Cheryl’s pool. How does it get into the yard? Why does the dog never bark? Cheryl feeds the coyote⁠—she says it likes waffles. Sometimes the coyote looks different; Walter thinks he sees feathers among its fur. “Probably ate a chicken,” Cheryl said once, when he pointed it out to her.

“She has one blue eye⁠—is that normal?”

“Dunno,” Cheryl said. “They have more rods than cones, what you see at seventy-five feet they see at twelve. That’s why she comes so close.”

Reverberations, vibrations, an echo bouncing off a wall. When Walter thinks of the mother in whose body he grew, he doesn’t know what to feel. But there is something there, not a cry or a bellow but a sound deep and sonorous⁠—like a rubbery bow across strings. 

 Walter is at the top of the last hill, swimming toward home. He thinks of his parents, regular people. “You don’t have to be special to be happy,” his mother often says. “There are a lot of unhappy people in this world.” He feels guilty, as though he is not entitled to his discontent. He wasn’t easy, nothing went down the right way, not formula or breast milk from a milk bank. “You were dolorous. You missed your mother. You missed your home. I didn’t take it personally. It made sense to me.”

He remembers his mother leaving him at nursery school. His teacher, at the curb, putting his arm around him, his teacher’s hand firmly against his chest. Was he hugging him or holding him back? Walter remembers the car pulling away, the taillights like afterburners.

If the teacher’s hand hadn’t been there, would Walter have run after the car? Would he ever have stopped running? He might as well have been left on the moon. “Breathe,” the teacher said. “Breathe.”

When he was a kid, he went for swimming lessons at the community pool. He learned to put his face under, to turn his head to breathe. He learned the crawl, the opposite arm reaching ahead, reaching for something just beyond the next stroke, the next breath, and the next. He learned to move through time and space and hear the rhythm of his heart.

The kitchen door is unlocked. His mother stands at the counter sifting flour, baking soda, and salt. Baking is what she does when she is anxious.

“Sylvia called, she was worried.” She ushers him in.

He hasn’t noticed he is covered in cuts and scrapes. Long lines, inflamed welts run up and down his arms and legs. He looks like he’s been attacked, clawed. His skin is red and warm from the sun, irritated from the chlorine. The pink war paint of the Phos-Chek covers him like a sticky layer.

“I drove all over looking for you.”

“I swam home,” he says.

She leads him to a tepid bath. Walter steps out of his frayed shoes, peels off the torn T-shirt, and, still wearing his trunks, lowers himself in. 

In the tub he begins to cry. He doesn’t even know why; it is like the weir has stopped working; the drain is overflowing, it is all the water he has taken in. He is tasting his tears; at first they taste like the pools, bleachy and bitter, and then like the sea. He thinks of Guðlaugur, the fisherman, and of the coyote who comes to the pool.

When he steps out his skin is wrinkled, raw, sloughing. She hands him a towel, which he wraps tightly around himself.

“I want my mother,” he says. “I need my mother.”

His mother doesn’t say, I am your mother. Instead she says, “I know.”"

    "text": "Navini had expected the visit to involve some kind of conflict or tension, which was what usually happened when they spent time together after a long separation, but the novelty of her mother’s presence in New York⁠—the sheer strangeness of seeing her there in the apartment⁠—seemed to bring about a suspension of their usual patterns, and their first few days together were pleasantly uneventful, peaceful even. They managed to leave the apartment by ten o’clock most mornings, and knowing that her mother would feel cheated if they didn’t visit the city’s more iconic landmarks, Navini took her to Times Square and Central Park on their first full day, to the Empire State Building the day after, and the World Trade Center memorial the day after that. It required considerable effort to conceal her contempt for all the loud, bored, oblivious tourists they encountered, for the roving packs of policemen, outfitted as if for a war zone, the gaudy kiosks selling I Heart NY shirts and key chains, but summoning all her resources Navini did her best to smile and project fresh enthusiasm on each excursion, telling her mother she’d avoided sightseeing in the city all this time only so they’d be able to do it together. Her mother, for her part, showed little interest in the places she was taken, insisting Navini take selfies of the two of them at every site to send to relatives later but otherwise paying little attention to the landmarks themselves, which she conceptualized only in terms of the streets, paths, staircases, and elevators required to get through or around them. It clearly gave her satisfaction to pretend she had no personal investment in these excursions, that it was only for her daughter’s sake that she was agreeing to come along, and though Navini was well aware that her mother would have felt wounded had she not bothered making plans, or had she shown any sign of boredom or restlessness, she resigned herself to playing along. It was sad and a little hurtful, these pretenses of investment and indifference that she and her mother both felt obliged to put on, these carefully calculated, heavily charged exchanges of interest and aloofness, but extended time together was probably not possible without these postures, she told herself, and ultimately they were a small price to pay for harmony. 

Their differences of framing aside, the truth was that after some initial adjustment Navini found it surprisingly enjoyable to spend time wandering through the city in her mother’s company. The extended, uninterrupted time together meant they were free to discuss more than the fixed range of topics they were limited to on phone calls⁠—more than the latest incident with Navini’s brother Niven, or what they’d been cooking that week, or which of their relatives was going into open-heart surgery next⁠—and it meant, too, that they could choose also not to speak, to lapse into the long silences that were a precondition of actually having things to say. Being in physical proximity meant they were free to speak only when they felt called to speak, and having a new environment to respond to gave them novel material for conversation as well, allowed them to comment on strange dogs and their owners, the ridiculous outfits of people on the train, the striking amount of homelessness in New York compared to Toronto, to construct out of these shared observations a kind of solidarity against the massive, impersonal city they were moving through. Occasionally, when they passed stylish or sophisticated-looking people her own age on the street, Navini found herself becoming quieter and more self-conscious, embarrassed by her mother’s odd appearance, her mismatched top and bottom, her cheap shoes and oversize parka, but she ignored these people as best she could, dismissing them because they were white, or bourgeois, or people who didn’t know anything about the real world, and she managed after just a couple of days to feel shielded inside the increasingly impermeable unit she formed with her mother. Holding her soft, slightly clammy hand when she noticed her getting overwhelmed at crowded intersections, swiping her MetroCard for her when she had trouble passing through subway turnstiles, Navini took pleasure in the new authority she was being granted, her mother’s new deference and physical docility, as well as in her own new position of guide and caretaker, responsible adult daughter. Her mother still exerted her customary powers wherever she could, especially in the apartment, and especially in the kitchen, but it seemed at times like something unexpected was opening up between them, a way of being whose possibility she’d never really glimpsed back home. It was as though the tension she usually felt in her mother’s presence came not from some fundamental incompatibility in their natures or characters, as she’d long assumed, but rather from the specific dynamic that was imposed upon them in Toronto, maybe by Niven and the convoluted triangle they always became part of in his presence, maybe by the instinctive conservatism that came from living in a city populated by so many Tamils. 

Navini had planned to have Kathir over for dinner on Tuesday evening, the fourth day of the visit, and her mother insisted on undertaking all the preparations herself, her usual anxiety around hosting amplified no doubt by the fact that she was entertaining one of her daughter’s friends from New York. She decided to cook four separate curries and a sambal, despite Navini’s insistence that the dinner was meant to be casual, and she rushed Navini down to the deli last minute to get a large bottle of Fanta when she realized with panic that there weren’t any soft drinks to serve their guest. Her mother had seldom shown interest in her friends when she was younger, had often been suspicious of their closeness to her, warning her to be careful what she told them, as if they presented some kind of threat to the family system, and it moved Navini to see her putting so much effort into welcoming one of her friends now, another sign, surely, that something between them was changing. Kathir dressed down a little for the dinner, his nose piercing the only detail that might have hinted at his sexuality, and upon entering the apartment he went straight to her mother and kissed her on both cheeks, told her how much he’d heard about her and how happy he was to finally meet her. He asked about her flight, about Niven, about their ancestral village in Jaffna and her routine at home, his unexpected attention clearly flattering to her mother, who complimented him on how well he spoke Tamil, looking at Navini as if to ask why she hadn’t been told more about this impressive young man. She responded to his questions generously, opening up more than she usually did, though her answers, as was usually the case when she talked to people outside the immediate family, were comically embellished, giving the impression that their life in Scarborough had been wonderful and that she and her two children lived in peaceful, flourishing coexistence. Her mother asked questions too, which she did not often do, and when she asked him what he did for work Kathir began telling her about his dissertation project, explaining his thoughts about genocide, displacement, and the diaspora without resorting to English and without oversimplifying, insisting on all the nuances and qualifications he would have made to a college-educated person their own age. She listened carefully, nodding in agreement as he spoke, making the occasional comment, asking the occasional clarifying question, and when Kathir was done she clasped his arm and said she was proud to see that young people still cared about the cause, which was, Navini felt sure, intended at least partly as a slight against her and her brother. Watching Kathir and her mother talk she was surprised and a little jealous, surprised because she’d always assumed that her mother had no interest in intellectual or political discussions, because whenever she and Niven had brought up such topics in the past her mother had always ignored them or tried to change the subject, jealous because her mother rarely ever asked about her work, rarely ever asked her anything except what she’d been cooking and eating. She’d always assumed her mother was averse to abstract or speculative thought, but she became doubtful of this assumption now as she remembered how often she’d seen her mother reading in Tamil when she was younger, newspapers, magazines, novels, and biographies, anything she could get her hands on. Maybe, it struck her, the issue all these years had been purely linguistic, maybe her mother had shut down her attempts at conversation only because they were expressed in a language that she could, at best, speak haltingly, a language in which she inevitably appeared less intelligent than she really was. 

The rest of the evening went well, with none of the long, awkward silences Navini had feared. Conversation slowed only when it came time to eat, her mother waiting till Kathir needed a second helping before letting herself begin, stopping to heap new servings onto his plate each time he seemed close to finishing. Navini was grateful to her for making him feel so welcome, for taking such trouble with the food, for talking so openly and being so curious, but something continued to bother her about the tone of intimacy, almost confidentiality, that seemed to have developed between her mother and friend. Maybe she was just envious of Kathir’s Tamil, the easy communication it allowed them and the slightly excessive way her mother praised his speech, praise she herself had never received despite trying so hard to improve her own Tamil over the past couple of years, or maybe what bothered her was the way her mother described their family, the superficial images of domestic happiness and harmony she was continually constructing for their guest, the way Kathir, in turn, despite knowing better, seemed to accept and encourage these constructions without scruple. The annoyance persisted, and when, later that night, as they tidied up together in the kitchen after Kathir had left, her mother made a comment about what a nice boy he was, how thoughtful and intelligent, Navini made a point of not replying. The silence felt charged, and after hesitating a moment her mother remarked that she was surprised she hadn’t been told more about Kathir earlier. How had Navini met him, she asked, how long had they known each other? She’d gotten the sense that he liked her, did she like him as well? Her mother’s voice was soft and earnest, her lips bent upward in a small, contrite smile. It was a smile intended, Navini knew, to acknowledge the long-standing pact of silence that her mother was now breaking, the agreement Navini had forcefully initiated two or three years earlier when, on a visit home, after days of being chided about how she was getting older, how she needed to find a man before it was too late, she’d thrown the TV remote against the wall in anger and told her mother that she wasn’t interested in finding a man, that her mother of all people should have known that a man didn’t solve anyone’s problems, that if the subject came up again she would stop spending her vacation time in Toronto. The small gesture of violence had seemed to bring the matter to a swift resolution, her mother falling into line with surprising obedience and tact, but it was obvious now, as she should have known, that her mother’s obsessions, rather than being stamped out, had simply moved underground. Navini began to understand why her mother had been so generous with Kathir that evening, why she’d spoken so much over dinner and shared so much of herself, and turning slowly from the sink to study the hopeful, uncertain expectation on her mother’s face, taking distinct pleasure in the effect she knew her words would have, she replied that no, she didn’t like Kathir that way, wouldn’t have introduced him to her mother if she had, and anyway her friend was gay, he only had sex with men, hadn’t she been able to tell? 

 

 

The next morning Navini woke up to find her mother on the couch, staring at her phone, glasses on and sullenly absorbed, though she wasn’t really interacting with the screen and there was no sound to suggest she was watching anything. Her eyes looked smaller than usual, swallowed up by the puffy skin around them, and she didn’t seem to realize she was being watched until Navini, still under the covers, cleared her throat and asked what she was doing. Her mother, startled, glanced up and told her she hadn’t slept, that she’d spent most of the night awake and had decided at dawn to get out of bed and make some tea. She’d been sitting on the couch since then, playing sudoku on her phone⁠—what else was she supposed to do when Navini was still fast asleep at nine in the morning? There was an agitation in her mother’s voice, and when Navini asked why she hadn’t slept, whether the heating had been turned up too high, she shrugged and looked back down at her phone. She didn’t know, she said, staring distractedly at the screen, she’d been lying in bed, thinking about things, and had started worrying about Niven. She’d wanted to message him to ask whether he was doing okay, whether he’d been eating the food she’d left in the fridge, but thankfully she’d managed to stop herself⁠—it was her rule now to communicate with him only if he initiated. He could, of course, have taken the trouble to ask if she’d made it safely to New York, to let her know that everything was okay at home, but that wasn’t how Niven was, he didn’t care about other people’s problems, only his own. Navini, still sluggish, was quiet for a moment, then remembered the plan to take her mother out shopping that afternoon, a plan that would become far more complicated, she knew, if her mother was in a bad mood. She tried suggesting that maybe Niven was busy, or that maybe he was trying not to interrupt their time together, but her mother waved her hand dismissively. She continued looking at her phone with almost demonic expectation, as if by staring hard enough she could force the arrival of news from her son, till sensing, after a while, that Navini was still watching her, she put down her phone and looked up. Of course Niven was busy, she said, if he was too busy to say a word to her when they were both in Toronto, how was he going to find the time to send her a message while she was away? She picked up her phone again, then quickly put it back down, as if realizing suddenly how obsessive she must have looked. Maybe, she asked, looking up again, her tone becoming more conciliatory, Navini could do her a small favor? Maybe she could send Niven a quick message to check that everything was okay? He would ignore any messages she sent, would probably get angry at her for asking, but if Navini messaged he would feel compelled to respond⁠—would she mind just sending a message so she didn’t have to spend the whole day worrying? 

Navini had learned to dismiss her mother’s anxieties about Niven lightly but firmly, to chastise her for entertaining them the way a child might be chastised for eating too many sweets, and sitting up in bed she told her mother not to be silly. Niven would be fine, he was twenty-eight years old, and could handle being home alone for a few days. Hadn’t her mother claimed she was done worrying about him, hadn’t she told her a hundred times that she wasn’t going to think about him if he wasn’t going to think about her? Her mother regarded her from the couch, smiled coldly, and replied that it was her mistake to have asked. These were things only mothers could understand, it was her own stupidity for having expected Navini to help, saying which she pursed her lips and picked up her phone again, leaned back against the couch so the bright blue rectangle of her screen was reflected in duplicate on her glasses. Navini rubbed her eyes, studied her mother’s small, tense, agitated figure. It was possible, she knew, that she was misjudging the situation. Her mother had probably spent the whole night worrying about Niven, wondering whether he was okay and feeling guilty for leaving him alone at home. Unable to text him herself, unable to relax as she lay awake anxiously in bed, probably her only consolation had been the thought of asking her daughter to text him in the morning, which was probably why she was taking the rejection so badly now. In most circumstances Navini would have ignored her sarcastic reply, or given her a sarcastic response in turn, but she knew that all things considered it was probably best to placate her mother now. She told her mother that she was resisting only because she didn’t want her to go back on her own word, that she could get in touch with Niven if that was what her mother really wanted, and reaching for her phone with an exaggerated gesture she began typing out a message to her brother, trying to make it sound as though she were reaching out of her own initiative. He replied, miraculously, in less than a minute, saying that everything was great, that he was happy to finally be home alone, adding with a smiley face that they needed to make this part-time-here-part-time-there arrangement more permanent. Navini conveyed the gist to her mother, omitting the comment about making the arrangement more permanent, and after asking her to repeat exactly what the message had said, savoring it like a little morsel of her son’s existence that had suddenly entered the room, her mother smiled at her in gratitude and satisfaction. She looked around the apartment, as if remembering where she was, then stood up with surprising ease and lightness, as if she’d been pinned to that specific position on the couch all morning and had only then been released. She told Navini she was going to shower, that it was almost ten and they needed to leave soon, and watching as she closed the bathroom door behind her Navini sighed with relief and hauled herself slowly out of bed. 

The idea of taking her mother out shopping, as natural an activity as it might have seemed, had occurred to Navini only a couple of days earlier, walking through Midtown with her mother after multiple hours spent lining up to ascend the Empire State Building. They hadn’t gone shopping together in years, probably not since high school, certainly not since she’d graduated from college, and her hope had been that it would be a way for them to reconnect with the past, that maybe her mother would be touched, given all the other changes taking place between them, if she were the one who bought everything this time. Navini could remember, back in middle school, all the excursions that she, Niven, and her mother had made to Scarborough Town Centre to pick out clothes before the start of the school year, how her mother would take them to all the lower-end retail outlets she’d heard other Tamil mothers talking about, reminding them which of their clothes needed replacing as they walked through the aisles, making various suggestions but ultimately letting them pick out the items they wanted. Occasionally her mother would object to one of her choices on the grounds of price, though she always tried to make sure her selections stayed on the cheaper side, and sometimes, on special occasions, if she’d done well at school or if her birthday was coming up, they would go to one of the bigger, trendier stores, H&M or Urban Outfitters, though she would only ever be allowed to get one item and it would generally have to be on sale. Niven began finding their shopping trips increasingly tiresome as he got older, and as he entered his teenage years he would often slip away into one of the video game or electronics stores, telling them to just get him whatever they liked, a request that both Navini and her mother would agree to only after a show of protest, though in truth this was the part of these trips they both looked forward to most. His absence gave them a project to collaborate on, something they could work on together without risk of hurting each other’s feelings, and walking through the boys’ sections of various stores, sifting through the options displayed on tables, in bins, and on racks, they would discuss the positives and negatives of each item that caught their attention, what they thought Niven would like versus what they thought would suit him best, her mother trying to glean from Navini something about the styles in fashion for boys, Navini taking pleasure in the weight her mother seemed to give her opinions, the momentary sense that they were partners in something, friends almost.

Sometimes her mother would buy her things on her own private trips to the mall too, not at Scarborough Town Centre, where she hardly ever went by herself, but at one of the smaller Tamil strip malls that were filled with Tamil stores and businesses, with sari stores, travel agencies, law firms, tailors, jewelers, CD and VCD stores, anything a Tamil person might need. Her mother would buy her cheap imitation-leather handbags, silver- and gold-plated earrings and bangles, gifts that were meant to be a kind of acknowledgment that she was getting older, though Navini rarely liked what she was given, and over time, as her mother began to understand how far their tastes had diverged, this practice too came to an end. The obvious issues with her outfits started coming up, that her bra straps were visible beneath the straps of her tank top, that the pants she wore when going out were too low-rise, but what bothered her mother often had less to do with how revealing her clothes were than with the strange ideas of style they seemed to involve, for example the ripped, intentionally distressed jeans she’d begun wearing, which her mother found especially offensive. Her mother would claim the jeans made her look poor, like she didn’t have anyone to take care of her, and her insistence that what her mother found ugly or ridiculous was in fact stylish only seemed to confirm her sense that her daughter was drifting away from her, falling under the sway of powerful, obscure, occult influences in the outside world. The only clothing her mother was still buying for her by the time she graduated from college was underwear⁠—maybe she assumed there was no such thing as style when it came to underwear⁠—and even after Navini had started working full-time her mother would furtively inspect her bras and panties whenever she did the laundry, taking note of all the fraying pairs she saw and then going out later to buy replacements, leaving them for Navini to find on her bed or dresser. Navini had found the heart to halt this practice only after the end of her first year in New York, confessing finally that she hardly wore the underwear her mother got her, that it wasn’t the kind of thing she or her friends wore these days. Her mother took the rejection in stride, but in retrospect the disclosure had come to seem needlessly cruel, and maybe it was for this reason, seeing all the tourists with their shopping bags in Midtown a couple of days earlier, that she’d decided to take her mother shopping during her visit, not just because it would be a way to spend time indoors, away from the cold, but also because it felt like a way of making amends, especially if it was her money they spent this time. She would help her pick out a few nice, stylish, more expensive items, some trousers and sweaters, an elegant coat to replace the ugly parka with the Scotiabank logo she’d gotten for free years before, things she could take back to Scarborough and wear proudly around the neighborhood, telling people they were gifts from her daughter in New York. It was true that her mother had never liked receiving gifts from her children, that she considered them a waste of money, but the more Navini considered it, the more drawn she was to playing the role of the hardworking, magnanimous daughter, the grown-up child who bought her working-class mother things she’d never been able to afford. She’d shared the idea hesitantly and her mother had, after some resistance, seemed genuinely moved, taking her by the hand and telling her she’d accept the gift proudly, that she’d be so happy to wear something that her daughter had bought her with her own hard-earned money. 

The day, it soon became clear, would not go according to plan. Navini had decided she would take her mother to Macy’s, which she’d never been to herself but knew was the kind of New York institution that would be familiar even to people in Scarborough. Macy’s consisted of nine vast levels spread out across an entire block, the street level lined with veined marble floors, and walking uncertainly through the stately entrance into the large, warm, brightly lit lobby, their faces fractured and multiplied by all the pristine glass and mirror, Navini immediately began to wonder whether it had been a mistake to come. They both stood there for a moment, slightly disoriented, surveying the display stalls arrayed with cosmetics, jewelry, and high-end perfumes, the backlit images of waifish European models with their mouths held open like goldfish, and only when Navini caught sight of the escalators did she try to guide her mother forward with an air of confidence, both of them drawn, as they walked, to the delicate scents of perfume and the momentary glints of precious metal, both of them keeping their heads trained in front of them so as not to be caught looking too longingly at something by one of the impeccably suited store assistants. The Macy’s-brand women’s clothing was on the third floor, and when they arrived her mother got her bearings quickly, heading straight for the aisles marked for discount at the far end of the floor, going methodically through the racks and paying special attention to what seemed like the ugliest items available, particularly the stiff fabrics and floral designs that already comprised most of her wardrobe. Navini tried to suggest that maybe she should look for something different from what she usually wore, bolder colors, fabrics that sat more softly on her body, but every item she brought her mother dismissed on sight, shaking her head in the disparaging way she had of rejecting without consideration anything she didn’t like. She found issue with most of the items she’d picked off the racks herself too, she liked the design but not the fit, or the collar but not the buttons, or the price was too high for the quality of the material, so that it took almost an hour and a half of browsing before she finally gathered enough items to justify a visit to the fitting rooms, where they then had to spend another half hour, Navini waiting outside the stall while her mother tried on and then decided against most of the items. She ventured out only twice, first to show Navini a pair of beige pants that were tapered too tightly toward the ankles and made her ass look unnaturally flat, then to show her a sweater that Navini had been hopeful about but which hugged her torso too tightly, revealing the awkward shape of her upper body, her unusually high waist and small chest, the same high waist and small chest that Navini had inherited. Navini tried to maintain an earnest, studious expression throughout, but something repulsed her about the strangely altered woman standing there in front of the illuminated mirror in those stiff, odorless, disturbingly formfitting clothes, waiting expectantly for some kind of positive response, and she had to suppress the urge to shove her mother back inside before anyone else saw her. She tried to emphasize once more that maybe softer, looser fabrics would suit her better, but her mother returned abruptly to the stall while she was talking and shut the door behind her, as if having changed her mind about wanting a second opinion. She came back out in her original outfit, which suddenly didn’t seem that bad, handed the entire bundle of tried-on items to the attendant, and then waiting till they were out of earshot, her lips pursed and her eyes directed straight ahead, she told Navini that if she was going to get her clothes as a gift then she needed to understand that her mother had her own tastes⁠—a gift was supposed to make someone happy, not to try to change them. 

They found, after a while, a green woolen cardigan that they both agreed was nice, though her mother didn’t seem particularly enthusiastic, and it was hard to say whether she actually liked it or was merely settling on something so they could put an end to their excursion. Navini wanted to go home too, to be done with shepherding this cheap, impossibly picky woman through the endless aisles, but the cardigan cost only forty dollars and didn’t feel extravagant enough to count as a gift, certainly not the kind of grand symbolic gift she’d been imagining. When her mother tried to lead her back down to the ground floor Navini tugged on her hand to stop her, leaned up against her and put on the exaggerated pleading face she’d used when she was younger and had been trying to obtain permission for something. She wanted to get her something a little more expensive, she said as sweetly as she could, something for her to use on special occasions, something better than just a cardigan. She had something in mind, actually, a specific kind of item, would she please let her show her? Not waiting for a reply, Navini led her reluctant mother down the escalator and past more aisles toward the winter clothing section, where pointing to a few of the racks she explained that she’d wanted to get her a nice woolen coat, something to replace her parka, which she’d been using now for too many years. She could get any coat she liked, she said, however expensive, the money wasn’t a problem, adding this last qualification with perhaps just a little too much assurance. Her mother’s expression, already irritated, turned angry. She didn’t want a coat, she hissed, she was happy with the jacket she had, what kinds of occasions did she have to dress nicely for anyway? There was a reason she always wore the same jacket, and she wouldn’t switch to another just because her daughter didn’t know the value of money. The dismissal took Navini by surprise, sparked a sharp flash of anger inside her, but not wanting to create a scene she tried not to respond head-on, told her mother that it was just an idea. They didn’t need to get a coat, though they did have to get one other item at least, otherwise she would refuse to leave. Her mother seemed inflexible and Navini was uncertain, but she continued with her posture of partly playful, partly stubborn insistence till her mother relented, and they spent another forty-five minutes wandering around till she managed at last to persuade her mother to buy a pair of pants she’d been lingering over. Navini didn’t love them but was satisfied because they cost ninety dollars, more than her mother would usually spend on a pair of pants and expensive enough, along with the cardigan, to feel like a significant gift. They stood in line for the cashier and she paid for the items with her card, her mother patting her shoulder lightly and giving her a tired, half-hearted smile of thanks. They had a quick meal at the McDonald’s close to the station, then got on the subway back to Sunnyside, both of them trying to seem content with the results of their trip but neither making an effort to speak, their silence becoming more and more rigid as the train took them beneath the river in the direction of Queens. 

 

 

When they got back to the apartment Navini put down her things and went straight to the bathroom to pee, locking the door, planting herself down on the toilet seat, and letting out a small sigh of relief, grateful to finally have a moment to herself. She sat there several minutes longer than necessary, checking her messages and email, skimming through the news, then getting up, training her eyes on the floor in order to avoid eye contact, she opened the door and went straight to the couch, moving the big white Macy’s shopping bag onto the floor and lying down with her phone just a few inches from her face. She tried to ignore the way her mother was puttering heavily around the apartment⁠—she was trying, it seemed, to communicate something with her movements⁠—and only when her mother went into the bathroom and locked the door behind her did she put down her phone and take stock of her surroundings. They’d been using the harsh overhead light since her mother arrived, not the warmer, more comforting bedside lamp she usually used at night, and surveying the state of the apartment in the bright, unforgiving glare, she could feel only an absence of relation to her home: the place was a mess, everything everywhere, unrecognizable as the apartment she’d shown her mother so proudly just a few days before. She’d become less fastidious in her mother’s presence, it was true, sensing that her efforts to keep the place tidy would be undermined anyway, but almost all the disorder was due to her mother, who, despite her initial show of wanting to respect the space, had settled in like it was her own unkempt apartment in Toronto, picking things up and leaving them in different places, putting her own possessions down wherever she felt like it. Her passport, brush, hairpins, and several bits of loose change lay scattered across the coffee table, her phone charger, her large hair band, an empty box of biscuits, and various receipts on the dining table. Her suitcase lay open on the floor like an unattended child, half its motley contents spilling out in dissatisfaction, even though an entire shelf in the cupboard had been carefully cleared out for her ahead of time. The free intermingling of all their possessions made Navini suddenly restless, and not knowing what else to do she began tidying the apartment, starting with everything on the coffee table, hoping that bringing some organization to the space would calm her down, which was indeed what usually happened, though today for some reason the more she cleaned the more irritated she became, each item she picked up and relocated feeling like yet another slight. There was no sign of movement from inside the bathroom, no trickle of pee or flush of water or taps being turned on and off, and glancing at the locked door Navini started feeling as though her mother had locked herself inside to make some kind of point. She probably just needed to spend some time alone⁠— they were both tired from the long day, neither of them was in a good mood, and it was wise, probably, to keep some distance⁠—but something about the silence that was emanating from the bathroom felt like an act of aggression. She’d been the one to withdraw first, Navini knew, the one who’d gotten on her phone and made it clear she didn’t want to engage, but her mother’s withdrawal went further, she’d intentionally destroyed everything familiar and comforting about the apartment then left her to sit in the debris, not for the sake of solitude but in order, Navini couldn’t help feeling, to somehow raise the stakes. 

She heard, from the bathroom, the muffled tinkle of water striking the bathtub floor, and realizing that her mother was about to shower, that she’d probably been getting ready all this while, Navini tried to let herself breathe. She organized everything on the dining table, made the bed, which she hadn’t bothered to make in the morning, and returned the plates and glasses sitting on the drying rack to the shelves. The apartment was beginning to look a little more like itself but she needed to keep going, and taking the vacuum cleaner out from under the bed, putting it on the highest setting, she plugged it in and began to vacuum. She cleaned slowly and methodically despite the powerfully strident roar, shifting the chairs and tables as she advanced through the room, pursuing each long strand of her mother’s hair she found till it was sucked up in its entirety by the machine. When she switched off the vacuum Navini realized that water was no longer running in the bathroom, and turning around she saw her mother standing at the threshold of the open door, a towel wrapped around her chest and her legs exposed from the thighs down, the scent of her cloyingly sweet shampoo wafting into the room. She gave Navini a quizzical look, went to the foot of the bed, bent down in front of her suitcase, and began searching for something, coming to a pause when she realized that all her things, her purse, her money, her new clothes, her brush and her hairpins, everything had been stuffed indiscriminately into the suitcase. She looked up at the apartment, its tidiness, then at Navini, the confusion on her face turning to annoyance. You didn’t have to dump everything in my bag, she said, in response to which Navini, who had, she realized, been waiting for this moment, told her with crisp formality that she’d been cleaning up, that she didn’t like it when people left their things all over her apartment. Where else was she supposed to keep her things, her mother asked indignantly, still kneeling in front of her suitcase, to which Navini replied that she should keep her shoes near the door, her clothes on the shelf she’d cleared, her toiletries in her toiletry bag instead of on the dining table. It would be great, too, if she could remember to put things in the trash, so they didn’t end up getting lost under the sofa or bed. Her mother found the brush she was looking for, closed her suitcase, and stood up. If having her in the apartment was causing so much trouble, she said, her voice carefully controlled, then maybe Navini had made a mistake inviting her to stay so long, maybe she shouldn’t have asked in the first place. She’d been unsure from the start about whether she should come, whether she was really wanted, but Navini had kept insisting, had kept telling her to come⁠—was it too much to ask, now that she had, that she try at least to make her mother feel welcome? 

She turned and went back into the bathroom with her brush, partly closing the door behind her but taking care, Navini noticed, to leave it halfway ajar, so that her action lay, in their elaborate language of gesture, halfway between concession and provocation. Navini thrust the vacuum cleaner under the bed and sat back down on the couch, looked down at the uneven warp of the wooden floor between her feet. She could feel the blood beating heavily along her temples, inside her chest, moving down the veins of her arms toward her hands, but her body remained motionless, in a state of muscular tension, pulled on the one hand by the urge to follow her mother into the bathroom and reply to her statement, pulled on the other by the wisdom demanded by the situation, which was, she knew, to respect the physical distance her mother had established, to keep the anger mounting up inside her confined, cordoned off, so that it would not overtake her. There was nothing she hated more than when her mother left the room in the middle of an argument, a habit her mother had invested in more and more over the past few years, ostensibly as a mark of maturity, though its real purpose, Navini knew, was to give her the advantage she could no longer gain through violence of emotion or rhetoric, to make it seem that by walking away she was the bigger person, the reasonable one, the one who was willing to be wounded without seeking revenge. It was no different, this new walking away, from all the threats to withdraw or disappear her mother had made when she and Niven were younger, the way she would tell them with such conviction that they’d have been better off being born to a different mother, that if she’d joined the Tigers instead of getting married then at least her life would have had a purpose, statements she made in order to punish them when she knew she’d been unfair, to make sure their fear trumped their indignation and they’d come running back without her having to apologize, begging her to stay, telling her they needed her, that they couldn’t do without her. Navini knew she had to be careful, that the best course of action was to try distracting herself, but looking up from where she sat at the partly open, partly closed bathroom door, seeing, through the slender vertical opening, her mother standing in the fluorescent light of the mirror, brushing out her thick, wet, tangled hair, so preoccupied by her task, apparently, that she was oblivious to her daughter’s gaze, it became clear to her that what she wanted above all now was to destroy that little scene, to go into the bathroom and destroy that idiotic performance of self-possession. Feeling her rage finally spilling over, becoming strangely, calmly indifferent to the consequences that would ensue, welcoming them with relish even, she stood up and strode over to the bathroom, pushed open the door with such force that it smashed against the side of the bathtub and rebounded, forcing her to thrust it open one more time, the sequence of bangs causing her mother to jerk back in shock, her features almost innocent in their surprise, one hand still holding the brush and the other instinctively moving to her chest to hold her towel in place. Her bearing was so full of fearful incomprehension that Navini hesitated, caught a fleeting glimpse in the mirror of her scowling face towering over her mother’s, became alarmed at how threatening she appeared, how exaggerated and even absurd her anger seemed, though the part of her registering these facts was no longer the same part of her that was responsible for what she was doing, and turning back to her mother she found herself listening with surprise but also satisfaction to the words that were coming out of her mouth, as she shouted, loudly and venomously, that it was so typical of her mother, so typical of her to doubt all her good intentions, so typical of her to say she felt unwelcome after all the effort she’d put in to make her feel happy and comfortable in the apartment, after taking a whole week off and planning things for them to do together every single day. It was so typical of her mother to act like she wasn’t wanted, so manipulative of her to say she wished she hadn’t come, to try to hurt the daughter who was in fact the only one in her life who took the time to talk to her and try to understand her, though it was no use anymore, she went on, straining at the edge of her voice, she was too old to be manipulated like that now, her mother could no longer make her feel bad for things she hadn’t done, she was no longer a child and was too old to keep playing these stupid fucking games. 

The words were spat out in a single continuous stream that Navini heard and processed at the same time her mother did, with the same degree of amazement, taking special pleasure in the way each spiteful sentence came out coated in spit, the way her lips, with every syllable that allowed it, coiled up and contracted before thrusting out the next projectile. She’d expected the words to keep coming and when they finally ran out she was once more as incredulous as her mother, who remained standing there as if paralyzed, her body still drawn back in fear, her mouth still slightly open, still holding the brush in one hand and the towel to her chest with the other. The bathroom was small and windowless, unbearably hot and humid from the recently concluded shower, and the steam that had wafted up was clinging to the low ceiling, gathering into clouds that were beginning to sink, softening the fluorescent light and somehow sharpening its clarity. Navini looked at her mother as they faced each other in that damp, constrained, airless space, at her dark lips and sagging skin, tender from prolonged exposure to hot water, at her eyebrows, beaded with sweat, and her wet, unruly hair, so similar to Navini’s own, her eyes still widened in disbelief, though furrows were now beginning to form along her brow. It was as though each of them was being held in place purely by the wild, alert eyes of the other, each gaze giving its beholder the same strange confirmation of her own existence, their faces partly reflected in the steamed-up mirror beside them, though neither dared to turn and look in case the other might strike while they looked away, the expression of anger on Navini’s face and the expression of fear on her mother’s both slowly faltering as each tried to calculate their next move, faltering but not falling away entirely because nothing had been found yet to replace them. Keeping her head still, shifting only her gaze, quickly and ever so slightly, Navini watched as a tiny drop of water trickled down her mother’s left earlobe, reached the bottom edge of her ear, then dangled there for a moment, earring-like, before falling to the floor. She looked down at where the drop had fallen, saw that the entire bathroom floor was wet, that her mother had, in typical fashion, failed to use the bath mat properly and ended up splashing water everywhere. It was one of the things Navini had always hated about sharing a bathroom with her mother, the disturbing sensation of her mother’s cast-off water between her toes, but instead of feeling anger or irritation now the tension in her body seemed to loosen, and she suddenly felt cruel for barging into the bathroom when her mother was unarmed and unprepared, still wet and naked except for her towel. She wondered whether there was a way to minimize what she’d done, to pretend her outburst hadn’t been as bad as it looked, or hadn’t really happened, but seeing this hesitation her mother, who had, it seemed, recovered from her temporary bewitchment, took a short step back, a triumphant, sarcastic smile appearing on her lips. Slowly and mockingly, not spitting out the words as Navini had but caressing them, fondling them almost, she began to speak. She understood now why Navini had wanted to bring her here, she said, she understood it very well, Navini had invited her in order to trap her, in order to corner her when she had nowhere to go, all for the sake of unleashing her abuse. Wasn’t it enough, she asked, that her brother made her suffer so much at home, did Navini really have to bring her all the way to New York to torture her too? Navini hadn’t been prepared for this, for the rapid reintegration of her mother’s features as her expression transformed from shock to spite, for the cunning with which she found words to not only defend herself but go on the attack, and realizing she had another opening her mother seized the opportunity, don’t think you’re better than me because you got an education, she cried, don’t think you’re better than me because you went to university, when the two of you were young you listened to everything I said, that’s how you got this far, but now you’re educated, now you think you’re too good to listen to anything I have to say. There was no use trying to hide it, she went on, she knew very well that Navini was ashamed of her, she might be uneducated but her uneducated mother was smarter than Navini thought, she knew exactly what went on in her daughter’s head, had known since the day she was born. She’d thought things were changing, clearly she’d been wrong, but Navini didn’t have to worry, if she didn’t want her mother there she would leave and never come back, would get on a bus and leave right then, saying which she clutched her towel to her chest with both hands, pushed past Navini with surprising force, and made her way out of the bathroom, shutting but not quite slamming the door as she left. 

Navini remained in the bathroom, unable to move after the rough contact of her mother’s shoulder on hers. Her mother was making one of her threats, she knew, throwing out a kind of bait or dare, trying to goad her into saying or doing something stupid, into saying yes, her mother was right, she didn’t want her there, get out, which was indeed what she wanted to say, though doing so would also give her mother incontrovertible proof that she’d been abandoned, would give her mother the right to point in bitter satisfaction and tell her what a bad daughter she was. She needed to restrain herself, to stay in control somehow⁠—if she went out and responded she would only be playing into her mother’s hands⁠—though at the same time it was clear she had to do something, her body was rigid with fury now, straining to contain itself, and she could feel, rising up inside her, moving through her arms, possessing her hands, the primordial urge to take something precious and break it. She would regret it afterward if she did something violent, she knew, but looking around the bathroom she turned, instinctively, to the glass mug on the sink, the mug she’d used for years to hold her toothbrush and toothpaste, the mug in which her mother’s toothbrush now also stood, a heavy glass object, thick-walled and weighted at the bottom, perfect for her purposes, because what she wanted was something that would fracture from the inside out when smashed, something she could destroy irreversibly and irreparably. She imagined herself picking it up and feeling its weight in her hand, imagined herself winding back her arm, then launching it down at the tiled floor, but realizing that her mother was outside and wouldn’t experience the full effect if she broke the mug inside the bathroom, she decided it would be better to go out and smash it on the floor near her mother’s feet, smash it so hard her mother would be shell-shocked and temporarily lose her hearing, though on second thought this scenario too was unlikely to unfold the way she wanted, in all likelihood the mug would fail to shatter on the wooden floor, would give off a dull thud and fracture into a few pieces at most, so that maybe destroying the mug in the bathroom was the best course of action after all, launching it against the floor or walls, because what she wanted above all was the pleasure of the explosion, to hear the glass shattering and the shrapnel hissing through the air. Nothing at that moment seemed quite as satisfying, quite as pleasurable, as taking the mug that was sitting there on the sink, smashing it as hard as she could, but something inside her insisted that this too would be going too far, that it would be just as self-defeating as telling her mother to leave, because the truth was that her mother, in spite of all her talk, was only bluffing, she couldn’t leave the apartment, had nowhere to go, no idea how to get to the bus terminal or airport, couldn’t even change her plane ticket herself. It was she who would eventually have to ask her mother for forgiveness, just as she always had, and an act of violence would only make the process longer and more demanding, would only require more of her afterward. Navini turned on the tap, let the cold water fill her cupped hands, and slapped it across her overheated face. She filled her hands and threw the water across her face once more, and then again a third time, intentionally letting some spill onto the floor. Turning, she opened the bathroom door and marched back out into the room, where her mother was sitting at the edge of the bed, her face in her hands, another of her vicious little performances no doubt. Navini walked to the foot of the bed, knelt down beside her mother’s suitcase, and threw it open, gathered up a pile of clothes in her arms and flung them across the apartment, a blouse landing on the couch, a bra behind the radiator, something hard striking the floor under the coffee table. She gathered another armful and threw it onto the bed, shouting to her mother, who kept her face in her hands, that she could leave her things wherever she wanted, that she should make herself at home, and scooping up one last bundle, throwing it down at her mother’s feet, she grabbed her phone, put on her shoes and jacket, slammed the door and went out into the street. 

 

 

Later that night, the two of them lying on opposite sides of the bed, their backs not quite touching but close enough to intuit, Navini was listening to her mother’s soft, muffled breathing, trying to determine if she’d fallen asleep or whether, as Navini suspected, she was just pretending. The rhythms of her mother’s breathing generally varied little between sleep and waking, rarely becoming looser or less structured even when she did manage to lose consciousness, but lying there silently beside her, unable to slow or stop her own thought, Navini found herself calmed by the gentle regularity of her back-and-forth, perhaps because her mother’s breathing was the only sound she could hear in the darkness, the only thing she could latch on to, perhaps because it reassured her to know, despite everything that had happened, that her mother was still lying there beside her. She’d realized, as soon as she’d stormed out of the apartment, that she would have to return home soon, not just because it was freezing outside and she hadn’t thought to put on her gloves or hat, but also because it would be cruel, on top of what she’d already done, to keep her mother unaware for too long of her whereabouts. She’d walked north with no particular route or destination in mind, moving at a brisk pace and keeping to better-lit, more populated streets, the rage pulsating through her body receding only very slowly, giving way only gradually to a kind of physical heaviness, so that she’d already crossed over into Astoria, her hands and ears numb from the cold, by the time she began feeling more composed. Returning to the apartment building after more than an hour of walking, unsure what state she’d find her mother in, what, if anything, they would say when their eyes met, she’d lingered for a moment by the entrance, trying to ready herself, had then gone upstairs, turned the key in the lock, and opened the door, only to find the apartment shrouded in darkness. Her first thought was that her mother had made good on her threat, that she’d taken all her things and was on her way back to Toronto, but as her eyes adjusted she made out her mother’s figure on the bed, her body small and compact, lying close to the outer edge, the sheets drawn tightly over her head so that no part of her was visible or exposed. She shut the door, waited to see if her mother would get up or say something, but her mother had remained motionless, neither shifting nor turning nor rearranging her limbs. There was no way her mother could have fallen asleep after she’d stormed out like that, Navini knew, no way, when she had trouble sleeping even on normal, uneventful nights, that she’d fallen asleep just after their fight, while her daughter was still out roaming the streets. She was obviously pretending, the pretense partly a protective measure, a strategy to avoid further confrontation, though there was no doubt an element of retaliation in the act as well, for her mother had often gone to bed after big fights as a way of punishing her when she was a teenager, sleeping or pretending to sleep in order to postpone the reconciliation that she knew her daughter would soon come seeking, to demonstrate that she needed her daughter less than her daughter needed her. Sleep too could be a kind of withdrawal, after all, an expression of indifference to those still awake⁠—there was no huge difference between her mother refusing to look her in the eyes and her mother shutting her eyes in a simulacrum of sleep, even if pretending to sleep had always seemed the gentler, more preferable punishment, less a pointed rejection of her than a wholesale dismissal of the world in which she lived. 

Navini had known no immediate reconciliation would be possible after the vitriol she’d shown earlier, and entering the apartment, realizing there would be no need to acknowledge each other till morning, she’d felt suddenly relieved. She’d taken off her jacket, slipped out of her shoes, then made her way on tiptoe to the bathroom, closing the door carefully behind her and leaving the light off so she wouldn’t have to look upon the scene of their fight. Glad to be warm once more, she’d pulled down her pants, lowered herself onto the toilet, felt a gentle tingling in her arms and legs as the numbness in her extremities began to fade, and only as she began to pee did she notice that the soles of her feet were dry, that the tiled floor was too, that in fact no trace remained of the water her mother had splashed all over after her shower. The bathroom had no windows or air vents, and usually took hours to dry, which meant, Navini realized, that her mother had mopped the floor while she was away. Letting out a sigh, she stood up and washed her hands, then trying to be as quiet as possible, she opened the door, put her phone to charge on the kitchen counter, and made her way to the wardrobe to change into her nightclothes. Scrutinizing the apartment in the darkness she noticed that there was no sign of any of the clothes she’d thrown across the room earlier, that her mother’s suitcase, wide open before, had been zipped shut and placed neatly under the dining table. Her mother, it appeared, had picked everything up and put it back inside her suitcase, which seemed, for a moment, like a reconciliatory gesture, an act of goodwill, though on second thought this didn’t seem plausible, for why in that case had her mother not called or messaged while she was out, why was she pretending now to be asleep? There was, if anything, a kind of masochism in the decision to organize all her things, in the decision to mop up all the water in the bathroom too, as if her mother was telling her that she knew she was nothing more than a servant, good for nothing but cooking, cleaning, and mopping. It was precisely the kind of self-deprecating gesture that would usually have annoyed Navini, but standing there looking at the small, unmoving outline of her mother’s body under the sheets, she felt suddenly bad. Approaching the foot of the bed she wondered whether to make some kind of overture, whether to caress her mother’s foot or say something sweet⁠—it would be easier in the darkness, when they couldn’t see each other’s faces⁠—though she knew this was probably not a good idea, not just because she was still feeling raw herself, a little defensive too, but also because it would be a long time before her mother would be capable of listening to any kind of apology. She’d climbed up, as carefully as she could, onto her side of the bed, insinuated herself under the comforter the two of them had been sharing, then turned onto her side so that she was facing her mother’s back, so that although their bodies weren’t touching it felt like she was spooning her, the floral scent of her mother’s shampoo flush against her face. She shifted around a little, adjusting her pillow, changing the positions of her arms and legs, hoping secretly that her mother would notice these movements, that she would sense her daughter’s desire for proximity and say something, even if only to be cruel, but her mother made no response, continued lying there stiff as a bundled-up corpse, and compelled to accept the situation for what it was Navini had turned back around to face the wall, tucked her hands under her head, and tried to pretend she was falling asleep. 

How long she’d been awake now it was hard to tell, but lying there still with her back to her mother, Navini remembered just how difficult it had been, when she was young, to go to bed while she was in conflict with her mother, how difficult it had been for most of her life, in fact, to go to bed while her mother was still angry with her or disappointed. Whenever she’d been reproached she’d always gone back to her in a state of contrition, not immediately perhaps, especially not if she’d been smacked or spanked or made to cry, but always sooner or later, approaching her gingerly, petitioning her with pleases and sorrys, even when she couldn’t understand how what she’d done was wrong. She would refuse to leave her mother’s side if she could sense even the faintest trace of frustration, would wrap her arms around her waist, squeezing till the last drop of resistance evaporated, till she smiled at last and returned the embrace, as though going to sleep while her mother was still upset was tantamount to parting forever on bad terms, to tainting their beautiful love for eternity, because that was what children were like, of course, they really did see each night as a kind of definitive end, sleep as an imminent death that meant each night’s parting had to be filled with real affection, failing which the precious bond that tied them to their mothers would be irretrievably lost, or irreparably broken. Their fights, it seemed, had only gotten worse over the years, and as Navini had entered adolescence the recriminations began coming from both sides, the constant exchange of accusations becoming increasingly vicious, requiring more and more time to recover from. Gradually she’d become capable of going to bed even when it was clear their reconciliation was merely cosmetic, and eventually she’d stopped caring about the facade of reconciliation too, though the urgent need for resolution or the appearance of resolution did persist when it came to other people, and for a long time she found herself becoming anxious if a dispute with a close friend or boyfriend reached an impasse, unable to concentrate on other things till an adequate amount of affection had been furnished as proof of each other’s love. This need too she’d mostly managed to overcome, which struck her on the whole as a positive development, a mark of increasing self-reliance, though reflecting on it now Navini couldn’t help worrying that something vital had also been lost in the process, that she’d become, over the years, more and more like her mother, harder and more recalcitrant, less capable of vulnerability and forgiveness. 

The truth, Navini knew, though she did not like to acknowledge it, was that her actions that night hadn’t been exceptional. It was easy and perhaps convenient to forget, since in other respects their relationship was as good as it had ever been, but the truth was that they’d been having more and more of these sudden, explosive fights in the past couple of years, fights that recurred almost every time she stayed in Toronto for more than a few days, fights that often began as small quarrels or arguments, sometimes initiated by her, sometimes by her mother, though no matter how vigilant she was, no matter how many times she told herself she wouldn’t let it happen again, for some reason it was always she who insisted on escalating what might have been a small dispute into a full-scale existential confrontation. It had happened when she’d gone home for the holidays in December, it had happened when she’d visited for a few days the previous August, and it had happened a few times the previous year too, and while these fights hadn’t been entirely her fault⁠—her mother could still be as hurtful as she’d ever been, still insisted on giving back as good as she got, even if in general she’d become less likely to instigate or escalate⁠—what felt new was her own inability to disengage or walk away, as though there was some part of her that needed to push through to the very limits of her anger whenever she fought with her mother, to wring from it every last, sweet drop. The fights, Navini noticed, had all seemed to follow more or less the same pattern: something would be said or done, usually unconsciously, that caused the other’s ears to prick up, that led them to furrow their brows and respond with a tone of severity or irritation that was maybe not quite deserved. This, in turn, would elicit a sharp response from the first person, most likely in the form of something that could itself be interpreted as an attack, and from there the situation would quickly escalate, both of them bringing up recent affronts or humiliations, branching out to injuries from further back in time, wounds of increasingly ancient provenance coming to light as they both cast desperately back, in furious search of the one historical grievance that would finally shut down the other’s attempts to play victim. The orbit of accusation would expand so quickly and so far beyond the initial locus of conflict that both of them would soon forget how the argument had started, as though both the original affront and the offense that was taken in turn were just a pretext for this ever-widening call-and-response of grievance, Navini’s recriminations usually revolving around the fact that her mother refused to show need or vulnerability, her mother’s around the fact that she wasn’t wanted or needed by her children. It was a process, once begun, that could seldom be stopped, the trajectory and end point fixed from the very start, each of them raising the stakes with their insults, accusations, and ultimatums, challenging the other to go one step further, moving, in tandem, closer and closer to the edge. Both of them knew, theoretically, that there existed in these conflicts a line beyond which reconciliation would no longer be possible, and both of them, even if neither wanted to be the first to cross this line, wanted the other to know they were willing to do so, that for the sake of justice they were willing even to put their relationship at risk, because this was the question, after all, that they were both trying to decide in these moments of escalation, this was the question really being asked in these moments of rage, the basic, most fundamental question of their relationship, of all human relationships maybe⁠—which of them needed the other more, who was more capable of going it alone? 

The question was never resolved within any particular fight, for the only way to end the escalation was to speak so violently or with such moral conviction that the other person was stopped in their tracks, the only way to win was to make it deafeningly clear, through your superior rage, that your wound was the deeper one and that you would brook no compromise. In order for this to happen the force of your statement had to so decisively outstrip the tit-for-tat escalation preceding it that the other person grasped, at once, the futility of trying to surpass it, was compelled in response to back down or walk away, but the fact was that even the loudest, most vicious, most unexpected words could be answered back if your opponent was stubborn and resourceful enough, it was always possible, after all, for the other person to perform some minor gesture of insubordination, to scoff, roll their eyes, or mutter back some accusation, enough to make it clear, even if their anger could no longer match yours, that they still did not take your grievance to be more legitimate than theirs. This had been one of her mother’s strategies in their recent fights, to deny Navini the justice of having the last word that her anger had earned, and it was for this reason probably that their fights had also moved so often from the sphere of the verbal to the physical, for her mother’s refusal in these moments to admit that she was wrong, her refusal to abide by the rules of the contest just staged, only ever had the effect of setting Navini off further, of making her look for a way to prove, immediately and irrefutably, that what she was saying was real, not just rhetoric or one-upmanship. Sometimes only a physical, tangible act of violence seemed capable of achieving this purpose, slamming a door, or shattering a plate, pounding your head against the wall or slapping your own face, though becoming violent was, of course, always a self-defeating maneuver, because just as there was a contest, when the fight was escalating, to see who was willing to venture closest to the line of no return, so there was a contest, once the fight was over, to see who could bear the gulf that separated them longer, to see who would break down and seek rapprochement first, a contest she would always be forced to concede if she resorted to violence earlier on. 

Lying there in the darkness, Navini thought again about their time at Macy’s that afternoon, the suggestions she’d made about the kinds of clothes her mother should get and the comments she’d made about the outfits she tried on. She’d taken care to be sensitive as they perused the racks, to explain her thoughts and preferences gently, with an air of benevolent indifference, but no doubt she’d come out sounding a little too invested in the items she recommended, her ideas and opinions just a little too thought-out, because it hadn’t been long before her mother, tensing up, seemed to sense that some other motive was at play, that her suggestions were connected to some long-standing but unspoken shame. Navini no longer felt this shame as strongly as she had when she was in her early or mid-twenties, no longer had to confront it as often because she no longer lived at home, but it was true that she still felt it whenever she was out with her mother, subject to the gaze of the more assimilated or more educated or more genteel, and it was true that even if she took care not to say anything outwardly critical, it nevertheless came out in a kind of constant, low-level frustration at her mother’s slowness and awkwardness. She felt it most sharply when her mother was drawing attention to them in public, when she was struggling to communicate with a super‑market cashier, or blocking the path of people trying to leave the subway car, which was why she always did her best to intervene and hurry her mother up through whatever interaction was taking place, as though the primary manifestation of her shame was the desire to speed up or fast-forward whatever encounters she and her mother shared with the outside world. Probably her mother had sensed this embarrassment at various points over the years, probably she’d sensed it over the past few days as well, but she’d never remarked on the subject and as a result Navini had grown used to pretending it didn’t exist. Their fight that night had been the first time her mother had referred to it out loud, and shocked that she’d come out and said what they’d agreed so long to keep silent about, her only response had been to punish her mother for telling the truth, for forcing her, at the age of thirty-one, to confront how petty she still was. 

She hadn’t always been ashamed of her mother, Navini knew, not as a child, not even as an adolescent really, not really till she’d left Scarborough after college to go and study in Montreal. Both she and Niven had been shy children, she a little more so maybe, but maybe because the outside world had always felt unknown and vaguely threatening to them, in a sense their mother’s willful indifference to the parts of it she didn’t understand had been a source of comfort and reassurance. Their mother might have been awkward and taciturn when dealing with other people, might have maintained a wary distance from Tamil society too, but whenever the three of them were together at home she had always seemed the center of the universe, a world unto herself, powerful and severe, her love and affection a kind of bounty that they were glad to have all to themselves. She’d been an attractive woman when she was younger, Navini remembered, with large eyes and a clear, dark, moonlike face, her body not quite slender but always active, healthy, in motion. As a child Navini had loved watching her brush her thick, curly hair, plucking her eyebrows in bed with a tweezer in one hand and a handheld mirror in the other, had loved watching her drape the heavy folds of her silk sari before they went to a wedding or to temple. It was strange to remember now, but studying the way her mother would apply a touch of makeup to her face in the bathroom mirror, the way she would carefully place a felt pottu between her eyebrows, Navini had often gazed up at her and whispered, in a kind of rapture, how very beautiful she was, that she was, in fact, the most beautiful woman in the world. Her mother would laugh bashfully and shake her head, would tell her that every child believed their own mother was the most beautiful, and she in turn would be strangely hurt by these dismissals, would grab her mother’s arm and insist with gravity that what she was saying was true, that nobody could be more beautiful than her, which usually led her mother to smile and kiss her on the forehead to comfort her, to show her that she accepted and was touched by her daughter’s praise. She’d repeated these tributes with great frequency and seriousness when she was a child, through much of middle school too, but perhaps it wasn’t surprising, as she grew older, as the world beyond their apartment came to be increasingly seductive, that the absoluteness of her mother’s beauty had slowly diminished in force. The most beautiful woman in the world had become, after some years, the woman she found most beautiful, and the woman she found most beautiful had become, after a while, merely beautiful, merely nice-looking, turning, eventually, around the time Navini was sixteen or seventeen, into just another middle-aged Tamil woman in the neighborhood, just another aging immigrant whose appearance was unworthy of remark. 

Navini hadn’t registered the change in her stance over time, but remembering this childhood habit now for the first time in years, it seemed to her that her mother must surely have noticed the shift. She may not have seemed to take any of Navini’s tributes very seriously, but there had always been a kind of radiance in her eyes when she sensed her daughter’s admiration, a gentle flush of her cheeks that Navini loved to witness, which was, after all, probably why her younger self had insisted on praising her beauty so much to begin with. Her mother must have been in her mid- to late thirties at the time, had probably been feeling, on her face, in her body, the struggle of raising two young children by herself in a foreign country, of years spent working in small factories and tailoring shops in order to make ends meet. It had already been over a decade since her husband had left her, the attention men paid her in public spaces, both menacing and flattering, had probably been declining for some time, and even if she’d never talked about or mentioned it the loss of her daughter’s adoration must have hurt and saddened her, the thought that her children no longer saw her as worthy of praise, that she was losing them, the only ones who still saw her as beautiful, to a world that no longer paid her any heed. Feeling a sudden urge to put her arms around her, to take her by the shoulders and tell her she was sorry for what she’d said, sorry for what she’d done, Navini turned onto her other side to face her mother, who was lying, motionless, in the same position as before. She wanted to tell her how beautiful she still was, how neither she nor Niven was embarrassed of her, how they wanted to go everywhere with her, that this was why she’d asked her to come stay with her in New York, as if simply by telling her these things, by willing them strongly enough, she could restore to her mother’s body its youth and defiance, bring back the smile that had once been so radiant and reassuring. Her mother, though, remained motionless under the sheets, impervious to all these feelings, and Navini immediately understood that none of this was possible, not only because her mother would push her away angrily if she became sentimental now, but also because it was no longer possible for the used-up old woman pretending to be asleep beside her to be reconciled with the mother she was seeing in her mind. There was no point saying anything now, even if what she felt was real, not only because more time had to pass before her mother would be able to hear her apology, but also because she was no longer the child she once was, her mother no longer the same mother. Navini turned around slowly, so that her back was once more to her mother, then reached back with her feet so their heels were touching, so that even if she couldn’t say anything out loud her mother might know she was seeking some kind of contact. It would be a couple of days before her mother would even look her in the eyes, she knew, but maybe there’d be a chance, before her mother left, to show her that she was sorry, maybe there’d be a chance to show her that she wasn’t ashamed.

Edmund Bliss took three reluctant steps back from the stall Mrs. Simpson had asked him to erect. (This was no small commission⁠—Mrs. Simpson sat on the fête committee the way stone lions sit on pediments.) The canvas was pink and yellow, and looked very smart against the grass, with the gleam of the vicar’s conservatory behind it, but there could be no question that the structure slouched on one side, like a man leaning against a bar, if that man were devastated by drink. Edmund went forward and pulled at the poles a bit. Then he retreated and looked about him with an amiable helplessness. The day was already hot and glaring. Everywhere stalls were assembled, canvases taut and angles correct. Edmund put his hands in his pockets and laughed. Through one pocket he scratched the upper part of his thigh. He was twenty-two, incidentally handsome depending on his mood and the light, with a short strip of mustache and hair that was receding at the temples, where he pulled down his hat. He lived with his parents in a house built three miles from the village for the view, meaning he’d had to wake horribly early in order to assist with the setting-up. He had come in his best summer suit, since it was too far to go back to change. His jacket was hanging on a chair in the tea tent and he was in his shirtsleeves.  

Mrs. Simpson swept past, irritation crisp in her voice. “Oh, Mr. Bliss. Whyever did you volunteer? And you took off your jacket. I’ll ask one of Colville’s men. You needn’t wait.”

“I’ll wait,” Edmund said. He scratched his thigh and wondered what Violet would be wearing.  

“You see how it is,” Mrs. Simpson said behind him. “I hope you don’t mind.”

“Nothing to mind. Morning, sir.” A man approached the stall and began taking it apart. 

Mrs. Simpson, whose twelfth year it was on the committee, went on her way. It was always the same: decorative young men cluttering up the place with their muddled purposes. She wondered how it could be discouraged. 

Edmund stood watching as the man fixed the stall. The sun, hidden behind a glare of white sky, was a pressure like a hand on his neck. He debated whether he could in good conscience say to Violet that he’d helped set up. “Can I do anything?” he asked, when the worst seemed over. 

The man tied a complicated knot and trod a peg into the ground. “Nearly there now,” he said, not turning. His hair stiffened into a ridge where it met the line of his cap, as if the cap were too small. 

“Just say,” Edmund said. He noticed Albert Waterson strolling through the gate and moved toward him, before halting. “Am I all right to leave you?”

“Let’s see if you’re happy, sir.” The man fussed with the canvas, smoothing and tucking it like a tablecloth, and then came and stood next to Edmund. 

“It looks very nice,” Edmund said politely. Beyond, he could see two maids inching a table from the house into the conservatory. 

“Good,” the man said. He had an open, outdoors face, shining from the heat but blotted by black hair and eyebrows. He and Edmund were about the same age.

Fête days encourage a sense of fellowship. “Thanks for rescuing things,” Edmund said, and put out his hand. The man took it and his warm sweat rubbed onto Edmund’s palm and between his fingers. Edmund put his hand into his pocket as he went off to find Albert. 

Albert was in the tea tent, where cups were being served to the workmen and volunteers. He was being firmly told that no cake could be eaten yet. It was slightly cooler under the canvas and smelled definitely of grass. Edmund located his jacket and carefully put it back on. When Albert turned around, triumphant with cup and saucer in one hand and cake in the other, Edmund waved at him from a table. “Hello,” Albert said beamingly as he set down his things, tea splashing over. “Where’s Violet?”

“Can I have some of that cake?”

“Not too much.”

“She isn’t here yet,” Edmund said, swallowing a mouthful. 

“I wonder what she’ll be wearing,” Albert said. He was a trim, dapper young man, who affected a monocle. 

“Awfully hot, isn’t it?” Edmund said.

“If she wears anything like last year I’ll simply fall at her feet.”

They looked at each other with displeasure. 

“You’re as besotted as I am,” Albert said. 

Edmund broke off more cake. 

Albert drank his tea, squeezing his eye around his monocle. “Probably won’t be either of us. Almost certainly. Except women do such odd things. That’s all that gives me hope.”

There was a lot of noise from outside the tent, outside the greeny, grass-smelling universe they had established themselves in: active voices, and mallets hitting pegs, and crockery furiously coupling in drawers being chucked about. The two young men sat, hardly speaking. They had been to the same school, then Oxford, so they were used to being trapped in each other’s company, in both moderately unpleasant and moderately pleasant situations, and to waiting for things to be done for them. They had never considered whether they liked each other. 

“Shall we have a look around?” Edmund said. “Violet might be here now.” He was rather afraid of being on his own again. 

“I hope she isn’t,” Albert said, though getting up and shaking off crumbs. “I’ve realized I must change my clothes.”

Edmund looked down at his own, much plainer suit. 

“Oh you’re all right,” Albert said. 

Outside, the sky was hard to look at, as though something sharp were poking out of it. The vicar’s garden was large and crowded with stalls, humming with pioneer energy. Only the marquee for dancing was still being put up. 

“No sign of her,” Albert said. “I’ll go and change. If she arrives, please don’t talk to her or amuse her in any way.”

Edmund watched idly as Colville’s men labored on the marquee. The man who’d helped him earlier was playing a leading part. He had taken off his cap and tucked the peak into the back of his trousers so that it wagged cheerfully as he strode about. His black hair was hanging lankly on his forehead, joined into thick strands by sweat. Edmund caught his eye and smiled. The man nodded in a preoccupied friendly way. Perhaps I should buy him a drink later on, Edmund thought. 

He’d gone back to wondering about Violet when Mrs. Simpson discovered him. 

“Mr. Bliss,” she said. She wished she had discovered someone else. It was so very hot. “A sheep has got out.”

“A sheep?”

“A sheep. It is in for a prize. It has got out of its compartment. Some boys have caught it but they need help with the lifting.”

“This is my best suit, Mrs. Simpson.”

“The sheep is in for a prize, Mr. Bliss.”

“I’m afraid I fail to see⁠—”

“It will be very clean and well brushed, Mr. Bliss,” she said tensely. 

Edmund stared. “What about the vicar?”

“What about him?” Mrs. Simpson cried.

Edmund didn’t know what he had meant about the vicar. There came the plaintive sound of a sheep in bondage. 

In her crisis Mrs. Simpson cast dignity aside. “You will be heroic, Mr. Bliss. Miss Laird will admire it, I’m sure.”

He followed her wild gaze to Violet, who was standing at a distance with her mother. She was wearing a lovely dress. 

Violet watched as Edmund tried to fit his arms around the sheep, rather as if it were a baby. The sheep resisted this maternal tenderness, squirmed robustly against the ground, surprising one of its boy captors, and kicked Edmund in the⁠—was it the eye? It was his eye he was clutching now. But he was trying again, looking determined, not letting the next kick, on his chin this time, affect him quite so much. The sheep was at length carried off, gone abruptly still and rather regal. Violet wanted to make a bow to its departing shape, held tight against Edmund’s hip. Her mother observed that the sheep was in marvelous condition and might take first prize. 

When Edmund approached Violet, Mrs. Laird was occupied at a nearby stall. He had an abrasion above his eye and his suit was rumpled⁠—on top of that he was rather red. On a kindly impulse Violet decided she wouldn’t mention the sheep. 

“Well, how have you spent the morning, Mr. Bliss?”

“I have been⁠—” Dark despair dawned on Edmund’s face. “Have you only seen me just now?”

“Just now,” she said, giving him one of her best smiles. 

The smile did none of its accustomed good. It was swallowed by the despair as if it had never been. Edmund touched his injury. “I have been helping set up,” he said in a small voice. 

“Oh, well done. It all looks very lively.”

“Yes.”

“People are arriving.”

“Yes.”

Poor Edmund. It did seem as though he needed a sit-down. But he was sweet. “Why don’t you go for some tea, Mr. Bliss?”

“You are very beautiful today, Miss Laird,” he said. 

These remarks, made simultaneously, did not clash and rebound but rather sailed past each other, landing neatly at their intended destinations. 

“I shall,” Edmund said.

“Thank you,” Violet said. 

They glanced away. 

“It’s kind of you,” Violet said. 

“A tea,” Edmund said, “is what I need.”

They parted. 

Soon afterward, Violet met Albert Waterson. He was wearing a checked suit with a mustard-yellow waistcoat, and a straw hat. His monocle dazzled at her. 

“Hello, Mrs. Laird,” Albert said to Violet’s mother, who was back in possession. His monocle gave out a single respectful glint. 

If Mrs. Simpson surveyed as from a pediment, Mrs. Laird was suggestive of a large ornamental gate. Impressive; attractive even, if you could see the attraction in heavy iron, manipulated by supreme technical skill. Violet was always trying to look past her, to get a proper view of things. She had given up on being properly seen herself. She hoped only to offer glimpses from behind the bars.

“How is your brother, Mr. Waterson?” Mrs. Laird asked. She had hopes of the elder Waterson. 

“Engaged,” Albert said swiftly. “Not quite, but nearly. Dreadfully in love anyhow. Charming girl.”

“And how are you?” Violet interjected. 

His monocle lit up. “Wonderfully well, thanks. I’m in the business now. They seem pleased with me. Sometimes I suspect Father is about to hand it all over.”

“Surely not,” Mrs. Laird said. 

“I merely suspect,” Albert said.  

“It is very warm,” Mrs. Laird remarked.

“It is. May I say,” he added, “that you are looking extremely well, Mrs. Laird. And you, Miss Laird.” 

Violet smiled. “I like your waistcoat,” she said. 

“Thanks!” He was delighted. “Your dress is lovely.” And then, the sight of it triggering some reflection: “I heard Edmund was knocked about by a sheep. Some boys ran up and told me about it. Said it was terrific.”

“I wasn’t aware.”

“Really?” He seemed lowered. 

Mrs. Simpson descended. “Mr. Waterson, there’s a tent peg wants stamping on,” she said. 

“A tent peg?”

“Off you go.” She pointed vaguely. 

Albert went off. The stone lion and the iron gate greeted each other as old friends in arms, and Violet shrank behind their defenses. 

The fête was embarked on its short, eager life. The residents of Haleton swelled it and circulated through it. The sky grew whiter and whiter. Noise spread in lapping waves from the shies and the tea tent and the marquee: shouts, the hard clatter of wood striking on wood, conversation and the click of spoons against china, the hemming of the band tuning up. Parasols bobbed like lilies on a pond. Children skipped and ran, stumbled and wailed. Men laughed violent laughter that burst at intervals like gunfire. 

There was a bush that emitted a strong smell almost exactly like that of semen. Some men and women noticed it as they passed by. It was rather shocking, in a vicar’s garden. But then some of them were shocked at themselves for noticing, as surely the vicar never had. No one referred to it, not even the newly married couple who sniffed it at precisely the same time and who, since the wedding, had surprised each other with their brazen lovemaking. 

The animals⁠—the pigs and the sheep⁠—turned in their pens; trod and nuzzled the unfamiliar ground; took applause; tasted the sweets of celebrity. The sheep that had hoofed Edmund took first prize in its category. 

The vicar made a speech and so did Mr. Dawley, the alderman. There was a raffle, sponsored by Groves’ butchers. The prize, a ham, was won by a gentleman whose bald head, when he raised his hat in victory, was comparably pink and glazed. Two boys got into a fight. Another boy, Sam, kissed a girl, Mary, the two of them pressed up behind the tea tent, their feet in a rose bed, unsuspected by the aproned ladies cutting cake on the other side. For both it was their first kiss, and neither ever forgot it. Sam swore that Mary’s mouth tasted of roses. 

Everyone was having a fine time. 

But isn’t it hot? they all said. Isn’t it hot! The air was dense, like cotton wool⁠—they moved through it trying to find fresh cool air behind. Oh, for a breeze! They sweated into their light summer things. Sweat was a taint on the air. The vicar’s flowers and bushes slept heavily. The conservatory was screwed into its place, dulled under the white sky, a clouded diamond. 

The band was playing. Music could be heard all over the garden. Closer to the marquee, dancing could be heard, too⁠—the confused tramping of feet and high confused chatter. Violet was drawn over, against the will of her mother. “It’s only the local people,” Mrs. Laird said. 

The marquee was open on all sides. Violet approached the nearest and stood on the grass, a few inches from where the wooden floor began. Her mother left her. The music was very loud. Violet was thrilled by it, and by the stamping laughing whirling dancers. The heat was shaken slightly by their movement, by the swishing stir of dresses, but everyone had red gleaming faces and damp darkening hair. Violet felt her own hot blood pushing in her. If only, she thought passionately and imprecisely. If only!

They were the local people. Some of them were the servants of people she knew, given half the day off; others were familiar from the village, the sons and daughters of shopkeepers or tradesmen. She did not recognize the dances, so fast and cheerful. The women whirled around laughing in the arms of the men. Violet’s attention cleaved to a woman in a fringed red wrap, held loosely by a clasp at her neck, that licked about her like a flame. The man she was dancing with was handsome, dark-haired; he had stuck his cap into the back of his trousers, peak first, so that as he danced it seemed to clap, keeping time with the music. They seemed very easy with each other, and very happy. The woman was not wearing a wedding ring. 

“He helped me put up a stall,” Edmund said, unexpectedly beside her, gesturing at the man dancing. His face had a flinching, nervous look. There was the mark above his eye. 

“Do you think they’re only flirting?” she said eventually. “Or is it love?” The band had finished and were preparing to start again. The couple were still holding each other, smiling and talking, his head sunk toward hers, hair hanging lankly, sipping at her forehead. 

“Oh, one or the other, I expect,” Edmund said, his eyelashes beating, and his Adam’s apple dipping in his throat. 

The band started, and the couple whirled away. Violet followed the woman’s red wrap as it licked around the man, like a flame licking at meat. 

More people were coming to watch, and Violet was now standing at the edge of the wooden floor. She and Edmund were very near together. They were both aware of it, both watching the couple, not daring to take their eyes off them. Their hearts were fast, as though it were they who were dancing. The red wrap flew about, and the man and woman laughed as they whirled, their hands clamped tight together, disappearing behind other dancers and then appearing again. 

How stiflingly hot it was! Violet and Edmund were very near, their hands down by their sides. And just then she felt the tips of his fingers curling under the tips of hers. 

She watched the dancers, blinded by surprise. Her fingers and Edmund’s hung together, out of sight, like necking doves. The man and the woman whirled and laughed, flashing their teeth. 

Violet turned her head slightly, so slightly she hoped Edmund would not notice. His face was flushed, his cheeks erratically pink above the pale column of his neck. She noticed a drop of sweat, descending as though on a line⁠—watched it slowly roll over the bump in his throat, heading for his collar. She wanted to put out her tongue and catch it, like a spot of rain. 

Edmund turned to her and the drop ran away out of sight. 

He smiled. And she smiled. 

Edmund stared blinkingly at the dancers again. He was the happiest he had ever been, and he needed to put an end to it. If the moment were drawn out, if he and Violet were to talk, he knew he would spoil it somehow. If only he could get away! He veered his head and saw Mrs. Simpson a few yards off. His and Violet’s fingertips were still touching. What on earth had made him do it? His great-uncle had been at Waterloo. Perhaps this was the last dreg of heroism left over. For a while longer he kept his fingertips there. Then he fluttered them in temporary, yearning farewell. He hoped Violet would understand that this was what the flutter meant. But oh God, he had not removed them. He had fluttered for nothing. 

“Mrs. Simpson wants me,” he said finally, almost choking on the words but finding solace in speaking into Violet’s ear, the stray hairs under her hat tickling on his lips. He withdrew his hand. Violet moved in surprise but did not speak. His fingertips cradled the memory of hers, and he held them crooked as he walked away, trying to ignore the fact that Mrs. Simpson, sighting him, was quite clearly trying to walk in an opposite direction. 

Mrs. Bodwick was enjoying a long talk with Albert. She had known him since he was a child, and this apparently gave her a tremendous claim on his attention. He had been bearing it with great fortitude until he realized that the bush they were standing next to smelled powerfully of semen. Its steady enveloping of him and Mrs. Bodwick was an unprecedentedly awful event. Surely, Albert thought, she cannot recognize it. And indeed Mrs. Bodwick seemed entirely unaffected. But for Albert it was a torture. He grew redder and redder. He understood it, this smell, to be a new part of that conspiracy on the part of the world, or God, or whoever’s miserable fault it was, to bring him to boil over absolutely with lust. He was a virgin still. He was doing his level best to keep himself one, to keep himself pure for marriage, for Violet Laird, but would anybody let him get so much as an inch closer to Violet Laird? Would anybody give Violet Laird a chance to say anything more to him than that she liked his waistcoat? Even though she liked his waistcoat! And was there ever a nice cooling mist of rain for him to walk about in, to wash his sticky, smelling thoughts away? No. There were two weeks of this stifling, cotton-wool weather. There was this damned bloody bush, sitting there wafting sex at him. There was this wholesale conspiracy to make him boil over, so that it would all end with some trollop off the streets, because that’s how it would end, with him surrendering at long last, simply giving in for poverty of hope, and then immediately getting a nerve disease and going off his head, being put into a home somewhere, a chill white room with a view of fields, and then being slid like a jelly into his grave and no one remembering him kindly, except perhaps Mrs. Bodwick, and perhaps his mother if he was lucky and hadn’t gone too horribly mad beforehand, hadn’t paced around flaunting an erection and screaming all the filthy thoughts that went in and out of his head day after day. 

Edmund! 

Albert had never been so pleased to see that silly face. Making his excuses to Mrs. Bodwick, he rushed over. 

“Your waistcoat is different,” Edmund said. 

“I went to change, remember.”

Edmund absorbed the checked suit and the mustard waistcoat. “I think you look rather flash, Albert.”

“Violet liked it.”

“Liked what?”

“My waistcoat.”

“When?”

“An hour or two ago.”

“Ah.” A look of deep satisfaction appeared on Edmund’s face. 

Albert wondered if he was all right. “You have a mark by your eye,” he said. “I heard you were kicked by a sheep.”

“It won first prize,” Edmund said. 

“So all’s forgiven?”

“Certainly.”

Albert still had his itchy irritated feeling and for a moment struggled to recall what it had to do with. He checked to see if Mrs. Bodwick was gone. “Look here,” he said, and dragged Edmund over to the bush. “You know what this smells like, don’t you?” 

Edmund sniffed. 

“Well?”

“I do, yes.” 

Albert was sweating a good amount. “What do you think it means?”

“I don’t know.” 

But Edmund did know. 

Violet knew it was a mistake, letting Edmund Bliss hold her hand. Not holding her hand⁠—only cradling her fingertips. It was most unlike him, yet like him all the same. This was how it would be, she told herself, to be married to him: a vague, tentative, fingertipping sort of love. If she ever married Edmund, it would mean she had become vague and tentative herself. It didn’t bear thinking about. She continued thinking about it as she searched for her mother, stopping to gaze all about her and seeing the couple from the marquee, the man with the wet dark hair and the cap that clapped at the seat of his trousers, and the woman with the red wrap that licked. The cap was placid on his head now, and the wrap lay quiescent. Violet saw that the man and woman were also altered: gentle, talking closely and quietly, him with his hands in his pockets, thumbs stretched on the outside, and her with arms lightly folded, head tilted back. Violet wondered about them again, with that guilty, jealous ache. 

Some time after, she was standing in the conservatory, in a mob of ladies seething around the tables displaying lacework. It was a competition, which Violet had entered. She wanted to see her piece. It was rather difficult, shuffling among so many ladies, when Mrs. Bodwick on her own took up so much space, and when it was so hot, hotter for all this kindling of parasols and dresses. Violet looked along the table she was nearest to, at the pieces of lace laid out, delicately indistinguishable. She wore a small fixed smile on her face, as though she were admiring the talents of others. She reached the end of the table and moved to the next. It was maddening to be so surrounded, and so hot, with the blinded white sky weighing on the glass above them, when all she wanted was to see her own work. And yet she knew it to be such a small thing, so insignificant. So indistinguishable, since she could not even recognize it. And yet when she did find it, far down the second table, she thought immediately that hers was the best, and felt irritated, preemptively, at the thought of not winning. 

The ladies were still in the conservatory, waiting on the judges, when Violet sighted Edmund outside with a tankard of beer in his hand, talking excitably to the man from the marquee. The man was also holding a tankard; he looked a little amused, and a little shy⁠—it was strange to see anybody shy around Edmund. Violet wondered why on earth they should be drinking and talking together. 

Edmund had remembered his idea of buying the man a drink only after receiving his sign. The sign he had received from the bush. The scent of life beginning. It had created in him a world-embracing joy and gratitude. He found the man talking to his woman friend in the red wrap and rather imperiously, in his excitement, marched him away to the beer stall, to be thanked. This was what he was doing now, thanking this man, whose name was Geoff. It was marvelous, Edmund was saying⁠—while turning over the thrilling afterimage of Violet as he had just fleetingly seen her, watching him with blatant curiosity from inside the conservatory⁠—what a fine job Geoff and the other fellows had done, setting everything up, and Geoff was smiling from his handsome face, taking long drains at his beer. Small spots of rain had begun to land, hesitant cool touchings of rain, extending from a sky which seemed, in its heavy whiteness, to deny all responsibility. And then, like a belch surging out from between close-set lips, there came a break and ripple of thunder. 

It was announced that Violet had won third prize. Her mouth ticked at the corners and she pressed resentfully forward against the gentle demeaning applause to where Mrs. Simpson was waiting to congratulate her. She was pressing forward when the air seemed to shudder, no, to dart⁠—frantically back and forth, like a moth under a lampshade. Only when it stopped, when the air went pale and still, did Violet hear the thunder, and the screams. 

Through the rain-flecked glass of the conservatory men and women could be seen lying on the ground in funny positions, as though it were a game they were playing. Violet watched a dog run shrinkingly over to one of them, sniffing at the head, and being cuffed away by an arm that reached down, tried to drag the body up. There were arms everywhere, reaching down, and some of the bodies came to life at their touch, with straining necks and jerking limbs. Some remained very still, permitting themselves to be dragged and dropped, to be rolled and patted and pleaded with. The rain was continuing to fall in its accidental, negligent way, and the glass was only slightly obscured in that period when Violet stood gazing through it, before she tore her way out into the garden, where Edmund and the man from the marquee were lying dead. Violet looked at the two men, thrown next to each other on the ground, and could not understand. The air darted again, though differently, making a change on Edmund’s face, deepening the mark above his eye. She heard thunder. People were jostling, a stream of summer clothes, and here was her mother, and here was Mrs. Simpson, crumpled and weeping. And⁠—oh, someone was lifting Edmund! She felt herself pulled toward him, as though they were still hooked at their fingertips. Edmund, with someone’s hands under his arms, his head nodding on his chest. A hook in her, helplessly pulling. The other man was being lifted too. His cap had fallen, it lay lonely on the ground like something trampled, and the woman in the red wrap was flinging herself down on it, on her knees, the wrap a red snare shut fast around her, she was holding the cap, her face covered with tears, her mouth opening and terrible words shouting out. 

Violet did not think of Edmund being carried away. Already this buried hook of pain was what remained of him. She ran and seized the woman, falling on her knees too. The woman’s shouts pulsed into her chest and Violet began to sob, gripping tighter, squeezing her tears against the woman’s neck. She heard someone saying her name and stared up through the strands of the woman’s hair at Albert in his mustard waistcoat, stricken, his monocle trapped and blurred in his eye. The woman shouted again into her chest, wrestling in her grip, and Violet put her mouth to her ear, whispering. “Was it love?” she said. “Please, tell me, please, was it love?”"

THE UNDOCUMENTED 

Men, women. African men, African women. 

— My name is Ba … Bamba.

— My name is Maré … Soumaré.

— My name is Katé … Niakaté.

— I’m Kara … Tounkara.

— I’m Hadji … Alhadji.

— My name is Madjiguène Cissé … and let me tell you, all of us are liars in one way or another.

— Real liars …

— We’re all identity thieves.

— By which I mean, we go by names that aren’t ours.

— (in unison) Identity thieves! 

— Or we don’t go by the names we should.

— (in unison) Identity fraud! 

— It’s true, I confess.

— Me too …

— Me too …

— All right, let’s start over …

— My name is Papiers … Sans-Papiers.

— Me too …

— Me too …

— The truth is, we don’t get to name ourselves.

— And we accept that.

— Not much choice.

— Speak for yourself! At our age, we can’t just let people call us whatever they like! Birth names are important.

— I agree, but it depends on the type of birth.

— So which kind of birth are we talking about?

— In this country, you’re born the day you get your papers. Here, we don’t have a maternity ward, we have the police headquarters.

— Before that, it doesn’t matter how much you scream like a newborn …

— While we wait to be born, we’re all called …

— (in unison) Sans-Papiers. 

Silence and shared glances. 

 

THE DECISION 

A group of African women and men⁠—even two or three individuals⁠—can, without a shadow of a doubt, be referred to as a pan-African assembly. To be a Soninke can mean you are Mauritanian, Senegalese, or Malian; a Senufo might be Malian, Burkinabe, Ivorian, or Ghanaian; a Malinke could hold a passport from any of at least fourteen West African countries; the Peul can claim the nationality of just about any country along the curve that runs from Senegal through Cameroon, all the way to Tanzania …

— “May the blood of the impure irrigate our lands.” At every demonstration, we sing the “Marseillaise.” Can you believe it? We chant these racist words while crying racism!

— Well, when we sing it, it’s more a symbol of unity.

— Racist or unifying, it’s gotten us nowhere. All it’s done is make us look ridiculous.

— We’ve been rotting away in this abandoned warehouse on the rue Pajol going on three months … 

— Not the most brilliant idea we’ve had, this dump!

— Wallaye billaye!

— Three months of pointless marches.

— “First, second, third generation … every child comes from immigration!”

— “S-s-s-solidarity … with the Sans-Papiers!”

— Slogans are all very well, but they get you nowhere.

— Wallaye billaye!

— Stop saying that!

— When we occupied Saint-Ambroise, at least it had class.

— Black guys wearing boubous in church, huh!

— You should’ve seen the big owl eyes everyone was making, ha ha ha! 

— The last time anyone occupied a church in Paris was back in 1977, in the Latin Quarter, Saint-Someshit-or-other …

— Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet!

— Oustaz, you’re the one who leads us in prayer, what do you know about Chardonnay?

— Safiullah! I didn’t say “Chardonnay,” I said “Chardonnet.” I read it somewhere …  a bunch of Catholic extremists who wanted to keep celebrating the Latin Mass … 

— People used to say Mass in Latin?

— Yeah, yeah, the same way we pray in Arabic. Except that the Catholic Mass has been celebrated in every language in the world for decades now. That’s what struck me when I read their story.

— Extremists, I tell you!

— So what did they get out of occupying the church?

— You’re gonna laugh.

— Make us laugh then.

— They’re still there, still occupying the church, still saying the Mass in Latin.

— Then why were we evicted from Saint-Ambroise?

— Have you looked in the mirror lately?

— There isn’t even a half of a third of a quarter of a Christian among us. 

— Wallaye billaye!

— We’re fucked!

— Really? So a bunch of Catholic Salafists get to hang on to their sacred Chardonnet but we’re living with the winos?

— A simple case of the blond hair and blue eyes, I’m telling you.

— Comrades, we’re up to our asses in it.

— Wallaye billaye!

Silence and shared glances. 

 

— Listen to me … 

Restless fidgeting. 

— And let me finish!

Silence and shared glances. 

— A few months ago, each and every one of us was nothing more than a miserable, powerless undocumented immigrant. Even a glimpse of police-uniform blue would make us start, sweat, and shake. For other people, the Métro and the commuter trains were simple means of transport, but for us those labyrinthine corridors were death traps. All it would take was a minor violation, a routine ID inspection, and we’d be reeled in like catfish from the Seine and sent to the nearest detention center. Raising our voices was a risky business. Our neighbors, our bosses, crooks, thugs, anyone and everyone could yell at us, call us every name under the sun, knowing we’d never fight back. One call to the local police and bam⁠—you’ve got a one-way ticket back to Bamako, Dakar, or Conakry. We endured all sorts of humiliations, and we just stood there with our mouths hanging open. Now here we are, in broad daylight, screaming and shouting out who we are … And who are we?

— (in unison) Sans-Papiers! 

— We scream into our megaphones who we no longer want to be … and who do we no longer want to be?

— (in unison) Sans-Papiers! 

— They tried to divide us. They offered documents to a handful of people, especially spokespeople like us. And they got a big fat “no” ringing in their big fat ears. We’re still here. Even the handful who’ve recently been issued residence permits have stayed. Divide and conquer doesn’t work anymore. From now on, we’re a united front. We’ve already secured something fundamental for each and every one of us: dig-ni-ty.

Silence and shared glances. 

— You’re right, but … 

— Let her finish!

Silence and shared glances. 

— The one thing we can all agree on is that occupying an old warehouse that no one gives a shit about is pointless … 

— Pointless, pointless, pointless! Like the bite of a tsetse fly on a buffalo’s horns!

— We need to occupy spaces that have much greater symbolic power. The ant in your shoes is much less irritating than the one in your underpants.

— Wallaye billaye!

— But where? We don’t even have a useful little factory to squat in … 

— You can blame the Hausas for that, they’re afraid of the White Man’s machines. 

Stifled laughter.

— And we don’t have a university at hand.

— Is there a Soninke person on earth who knows the way to a university?

Raucous laughter.

— We could occupy a ministry, maybe even the Ministry of the Interior!

Shouts and laughter. 

— If we so much as take a step in that direction, they won’t just evict us, they’ll dissolve us, like salt in a bowl of mafe …  

— Subhanallah!

— You’re interrupting her again … 

Silence and shared glances. 

— From Pajol to République, then République to Pajol via the Gare du Nord and from there to La Chapelle … On the deafening route of our weekly marches, you come to a McDo, and on the left is the rue Jean-François Lépine. I don’t know if he’s actually related to Louis Lépine, the former chief of police, but it has the right ring to it. And right at the end of the street, there’s a courtyard and a church, the Église Saint-Bernard.

— Another church?

— What is it with you and churches?

— It’s no coincidence that there are more than a hundred and ten churches in Paris alone⁠—more than there are mosques in Timbuktu or Touba. Churches are powerful symbols in this country!

— But last time it only took them three days to kick us out of your “powerful symbol.” This time, we wouldn’t last twenty-four hours.

— Last time, no one was expecting us. But months of demonstrations and marches have brought us out of the shadows. And last time wasn’t in early summer. People weren’t itching to go get sunburned on a beach here in France or in some faraway place⁠—probably in one of the countries we come from … 

— And all they need are their passports!

— Going on vacation without a care in the world⁠—that’s their priority. At this time of year, they’re trying to stall for time. Otherwise they wouldn’t have waited until now to announce that they’ll regularize the status of a few Sans-Papiers on a case-by-case basis …

Silence and shared glances. 

— What about the priest and his boss the cardinal? Couldn’t they call the cops or sign a requisition order again?

— Like I said, last time nobody knew who we were. If the priest and his boss sign a requisition order, word will spread all over France. And you should never underestimate the power of Catholic guilt.

Silence and shared glances. 

—  Now, I looked at several prospective churches before I settled on this one. I could see on the priest’s face that he’s the type to ask questions rather than give answers. People who ask questions are better equipped to cling to their beliefs, body and soul.

— That’s all you’ve got to reassure us?

— It’s not nothing. For the rest, I have faith. 

Silence and shared glances. 

 

THE PRIEST 

We tend to think of faith as an ethereal concept that hovers over us, something to be grasped when we need to rise above difficult situations or to explain the unexplainable. But faith is inside us, a patient feeling that bides its time, waiting to express itself. When the day comes that faith reveals itself to you, the sequence of events may seem remarkable, even miraculous. Do not allow yourself to be seduced. The temptation to feel that you are at the center of the extraordinary is great. But nothing is extraordinary, or everything is. Getting up in the morning, breathing, seeing, hearing, walking, talking, eating, running, dancing, singing … Everything is already extraordinary, with or without faith.

On that particular Friday, I was preparing my sermon for the Sunday Mass. The subject was something said by Christ in the Gospel of Saint Matthew: “Whoever welcomes you welcomes Me, and whoever welcomes Me welcomes the One who sent Me.” 

It is at this moment and not another, at the precise moment when I am reading this sentence, that I hear a commotion.

Curious, I peer out the window: there is a crowd of protesters out on the street. They are all Black, and I assume that they are Africans. The woman leading them chants “Papers …” and the throng behind her responds “For everyone!” The woman leads the march and leads the chanting, in four-four time. The rhythm is too steady for this to be a spontaneous civilian protest. My imagination fills in the snare and bass drums. The tempo gets faster as they approach. The tension mounts as they advance.

A child marches next to the woman. I am reminded of a story I heard about the Baoulé people’s exodus from Ghana to the present-day Côte d’Ivoire. Hunted and pursued by their oppressors from the Ashanti kingdom, they were led to freedom by the princess Abla Pokou. A river blocked their path, and only after the princess sacrificed her child to the raging floodwaters did the river part and the people cross. When I first heard this story, I was outraged. But then I remembered that our God also sacrificed His own Son, His only Son, to save us.

The boy barely comes up to the woman’s hip. Walking beside her, keeping time, he seems to be growing out of her, like a third leg. Behind them is a torrent of men and women, and the tripod woman extends an arm, palm outstretched, toward the door of the church. The ancient oak gleams with the patina imparted by thousands of devout hands. As I watch, it seems to me that the woman’s hand does not touch or even graze the door. Yet the door obeys her. It does not open, it parts.

 

THE FAMILIES 

An African family is a group of individuals bonded by blood, by name, by history (generally legend), by love. In traditional villages, families live close together, in areas that, over time, become neighborhoods. By fashioning towns out of these villages, colonial urban planners often unwittingly formalized the preexisting distribution of neighborhoods, and hence of families. In Bamako, for example, the Tourés live in the Bagadadji quarter, the Niarés Niaréla, and the Dravés ... Dravéla. The democracy of the palaver tree has always served to convene families. In Saint-Bernard, the palaver tree is a stretch of corridor behind the nave. 

— So, things will be no different from how they were in the warehouse on Pajol. Our organizational structure will be the same. The only thing to bear in mind is that this is a much smaller space.

— And, more importantly, it’s a church. A sacred place.

— You’re right. We have to be as discreet and tidy as possible.

— In that case, I think we’re missing a committee.

— Which one?

— A laundry committee.

— I hope you’re not planning to string our clotheslines between the ambulatories across the nave, right in front of the tabernacle? God won’t like seeing our boxer shorts fluttering like flags in his house.

— Ambulatory, nave, tabernacle … how do you know all these bizarre words?

— That’s French colonialism, my brother! You can be whoever you like out in the streets, but the minute you set foot inside a school, you’re a Christian.

— Wallaye billaye!

— I always knew their weird form of secularism would come in handy one day.

— Comrades, we need to be serious.

— I am being serious, at least as far as the laundry committee is concerned. Christians don’t perform ritual ablutions the way we do. To the Bedouins of the desert who gave us Islam, the symbolism of water is very powerful. You can see it everywhere, especially in places of worship. In Christian churches, apart from the font they dip their hands into from time to time, there’s hardly any water.

— I think our supporters can help us with that.

— We can hardly expect foreigners to wash our clothes for us!

— They have machines to wash them. We need to decide on times for dirty laundry to be collected and distributed among supporters who have washing machines, and then to have the clean clothes picked up and returned …

— A few years ago, when I moved to Abidjan, I worked as a fanico. I’d go around the neighborhood collecting the clothes, take them down to the river, and, in the evening, go back around to give them back. I never made a mistake. I have a system.

— Perfect!

— Families!

— (in unison) Oooh! 

— Any objections to our brother here being chairman of the laundry committee? 

A hand goes up. A woman. 

— We women are not going to let some man collect our underwear. I would like to nominate myself as cochair.

— Families!

— (in unison) Oooh! 

— If anyone objects to our sister here being cochair of the laundry committee, please raise your hand.

All hands are silent.

 

THE HUNGER STRIKE 

In the democracy of the palaver tree, indisputably the oldest in the world, the word democracy is wholly qualitative. The people place absolute trust in intelligence and the power of persuasion.  

— We’ve come to the point where we need to make the gravest decision we’ve had to make since the beginning of our struggle …

— An urgent decision!

— If we decide in favor, it will have to be implemented immediately and intelligently. There can be no turning back.

— It’s obvious. Hunger strike!

— Speak for yourself … Aren’t people going to laugh, to say that in our sub-Saharan countries we’re used to eating nothing, that we’re only extending Ramadan and all that bullshit? 

— The mediators and most of our supporters are absolutely opposed to the idea. They think it’s dangerous, even counterproductive. The chief of police could use it as an excuse to intervene.

— I disagree. A hunger strike will force them into negotiations. That’s the whole point. The government, the ministry, the prefecture, the police, the panel of mediators … we need to show them all we mean business.

Silence and shared glances. 

— What would be a victory for us, the Sans-Papiers of Saint-Bernard?

— Documents for everyone, our statuses being universally regularized.

— So that is what we should aim for. And what would victory look like for the government?

— To throw us out of the church, then out of the country.

— Wrong! They don’t really want to evict us.

— Are you crazy?

— Maybe he started his own hunger strike. An empty stomach can play terrible tricks on a fat head.

— I’ve never been more lucid. No government, not even the most racist one of all time, would dream of deporting every undocumented immigrant. They know there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of us working in sectors of the economy where their spoiled brats would never set foot. What’s more, we pay taxes and social security like everyone else, but without getting the benefits we’re owed. We couldn’t be more profitable.

— We only ever go to the hospital in an emergency, because we’re scared we’ll be turned away. Unless you already look like a corpse, they ask for your papers before they’ll see you.

— Meanwhile, the brats run to the doctor as soon as they get the slightest scratch.

— And it’s the people popping handfuls of antidepressants who say we’re exploiting the system!

— Capitalism loves us, it adores us!

— If the government doesn’t want to deport us, why all the song and dance?

— Because this song and dance is the essence of politics! At Saint-Ambroise, the police stormed in mostly just for show. “Citizens of France, we are watching, we are evicting the evil Blacks from your churches, these people who are not just stealing your jobs but defiling your ancient symbols, desecrating your sacred places. You can sleep soundly in your beds tonight. And when you wake up, don’t forget to vote for us” … And, of course, we’re supposed to crawl back under our rocks and never show our faces again …

— They’d like to wake up and find we’ve disappeared from the news …

— Uh-uh!

— When they’re no longer the only ones onstage, they lose all control over the rest of the cast. We were supposed to keep quiet …

— And we didn’t shut up.

— No way!

— We’re not going to shut up ever again.

— The people of France will be spending their days with us, they’ll fall asleep with us, have nightmares about us, and when they wake up, we’ll still be right there under their noses.

— Families!

— (in unison) Oooh! 

— We’re in Europe now. No matter how powerful or clear-cut the argument, we still have to vote. All those in favor?

Absolute trust in intelligence and the power of persuasion. 

All hands are raised.

— Hey, hey, settle down! We can’t all stop eating! We still need troops on the battlefield, soldiers in top shape. The people who strike must be our ambassadors. The most motivated, the most resilient …

— The most determined …

All hands go up.

— This is getting out of hand!

— No, it’s not. All these hands in the air are saying, Every one of us is prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice.

— Then let’s have each family nominate its champion.

— You can’t nominate someone else to go on a hunger strike.

Silence and shared glances. 

A few people break away from the group to form a smaller group that steps away from the mass, isolating itself. 

— Hey, you …

A man in the smaller group turns around. 

— You’re diabetic, you can’t …

— Yes, I can!

— We know you can, but it might put you, and the whole movement, at risk.

— …

— Here, I’ll take your place.

 

THE SPOKESPEOPLE 

Three men and a woman, Africans, facing the assembled families.

— Spokespeople!

— (spokespeople in unison) Oooh!

— We have voted for you to continue your mission as our representatives to the media and the world.

— Porte-paroles!

— Oooh!

— The French word porte means “door.” In many of our languages, a single word can designate both a door and the mouth through which words are spoken. In Bambara it is da.

— Porte-paroles!

— Oooh!

— You are our doors, you protect us from the outside world. You are our words, you tell the outside world about us. And, through you, the outside world sees us.

Silence and shared glances. 

— Families!

— (in unison) Oooh! 

— There are many journalists here. And many more will come. Every one will be looking for a unique angle, something to set them apart. 

— Many of them will try to avoid going through our doors. They will try the windows, the hatches, the roof, and every crack in the wall …

— And that’s fair enough. That’s their job.

— It is up to us to present a single mouth, a single door.

— If a journalist asks you to comment on something or other …

— And it’s bound to happen …

— Just say: “Families decide!”

— Huh? Are you trying to turn us into a flock of parrots?

— It’s bad enough that they think we’re morons before we even open our mouths … 

— Families!

— (in unison) Ooooh!

— Let me tell you a story.

— Aaaaah, now here is a real spokeswoman.

— A gathering of Africans where no one says “Let me tell you a story” is like a zebu without a hump …

— Shut up, let Madji tell her story.

Silence and shared glances. 

— Once, I went to Gabon for a seminar for German teachers in Francophone West Africa. I was invited to dinner at a colleague’s house, and I was astonished to hear a small gray parrot with a red tail reciting verses by Goethe, a great German poet.

— A bird that can speak German?

— Absolutely. And with an accent that none of my students in Dakar could manage, despite my years of effort.

— Subhanallah!

— How is that possible?

— I asked the the same question, and my eyes were as wide as yours are now.

Burst of laughter.

— In the impenetrable forests of Gabon, a story is told that, at the creation of the world, the little gray parrot with the red tail was, like all the other birds, naked and without a single feather. Noticing the parrot’s uncommon kindness, God left him to clothe his fellow birds while He handled the apes and the humans. In the workshop he gave the parrot, there were piles of feathers and pots of pigment in every color of the rainbow. The little parrot threw himself into his task. He wanted the birds to have the most beautiful and joyous colorings on earth. So diligent was he that, in the end, there was only a little bit of red pigment left, just enough for the tip of his tail. For the rest of his feathers, he covered himself with the ashes from the forge used to fuse the colors of the other birds. God, moved by his selflessness, gave the parrot a share of the intelligence he had reserved for men and apes. Since then, among many forest peoples, the parrot has been revered. It is the only animal capable of helping others without expecting something in return. And when it repeats what it is told, this is not because it is stupid, but because it trusts.

Silence and shared glances. 

— Families!

— (in unison) Ooooh! 

— In the name of all our brothers and sisters in the lands of great forests and torrential rains, who are also watching our struggle, never be ashamed to act like a parrot. We, who carry your words, also carry your intelligence. In all our societies, there have always been people to whom we entrust the word.

— The griots.

— Singers, dancers, sculptors, weavers, healers … all of them carry the word passed from mouth to mouth, from door to door. 

— This woman knows how to talk to us.

— Wallaye billaye!

— We understand, sister Madji.

— “Hello monsieur, what brings you here?”

— “Families decide!”

— “Hello madame, can you tell me about the living conditions in there?”

— “Families decide!”

— “Who framed Roger Rabbit?”

— “Families decide!”

Bursts of laughter.

 

THE WEDDING 

Seen from above, Saint-Bernard de la Chapelle looks like a giant tortoise. The chancel⁠—where the clergy celebrate Mass⁠—makes a magnificent head on which two arched windows sit like slightly bulging eyes. The two smaller side chapels give the tortoise two fine front legs. The narthex, the antechamber where the great doors are located, can therefore be considered the tortoise’s rear. The narthex is topped by the steeple, a tail reaching up toward the sky. 

— So a church is always entered from the rear?

— Subhanallah, don’t say such blasphemies!

— It is not blasphemy. Ask the priest.

— Technically, he’s right. But you enter a church to face the Lord. Come in and the crucifix and the sacristy are immediately visible. Whether in Dakar or Paris, all churches are built this way.

 

Churches in France, like mosques, are built to face eastward. The symbolism is clear: faith is the sun that rises to illuminate the world. Saint-Bernard de la Chapelle is an exception. The symbolism is clear: when night falls, faith alone lights up the world.

— So every time we perform salat our asses are pointing to the holy of holies? Damnation!

 

Saint-Bernard de la Chapelle of the Sans-Papiers knows how to encompass Christian faith, Muslim faith, and revolutionary faith.

In the right aisle, along the corridor between the nave and the wall, are men and women with their backs to the altar, facing the doors. Arms folded, they stand, bow, kneel, press their foreheads to the floor, kneel, bow, stand with hands folded … synchronously.

— Allahu Akbar!

At the altar, the parish priest is not only elevated above the congregation of the faithful but separated from it by the rood screen, a magnificent partition of intricately carved wood. A church is designed to make the sons and daughters of God Almighty feel small before his representatives on earth. The priest raises the chalice of wine and the host of bread.

— Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.

The men and women kneeling in the front pews of the two rows opposite the priest bring their right hands to the heart … synchronously. 

— (in unison) Lord, I am not worthy to receive You. But only say the word and my soul shall be healed.

 

Saint-Bernard de la Chapelle of the Sans-Papiers is celebrating a wedding. The couple is from Comoros, but the congregation has come from all over the world. The guests, the Sans-Papiers, their supporters, the journalists, the onlookers, children … everyone brings their own festive touch. At the end of the ceremony, the Sans-Papiers form a guard of honor, the newlyweds walking through the human tunnel to cheers and applause.

At the church doors, their words complement each other, complete each other, add to each other … they marry. 

— At first, we found your presence in this church discouraging.

— Rumors were rife among the parishioners.

— “The Sans-Papiers have defiled our church!”

— There were even stories that you’d taken the priest hostage.

— We were about to call off the wedding.

— But as Comorans, we couldn’t help but be sympathetic to people in a situation we ourselves have been through.

— The kwassa-kwassa, the wild canoe of hope …

— Paddling seventy kilometers down a raging stretch of sea.

— All the way to Plage du Préfet, in the north …

— Our first piece of France …

— And then the long crossing to join family in Marseille …

— By plane, rest assured.

— Marseille, the largest Comoran community outside Comoros …

— We traveled more than seven thousand kilometers …

— But our journey was just getting started.

— We didn’t stay long …

— We came up to Paris and lived a clandestine life, like you …

— Like all the Sans-Papiers.

— We found a new family …

— The family of the Church of Saint-Bernard de la Chapelle.

— They helped us with the process.

— Or rather with the hassle …

— Then the long wait for documents …

— This marriage is not only our union …

— But also a way of celebrating our new papers …

— Celebrating our new life as it begins.

— For us, your presence here was a sign.

— A beautiful sign.

— The Comoros are 99.99 percent Muslim …

— We are the 0.01 percent Christians.

— But we always felt free to express our faith in a sea of Muslims.

— So, we were probably the only couple who were prepared …

— To get married in a church occupied by Muslims …

— And we didn’t want to be like the people undermining your movement …

— Absolutely not!

— So, we have come to silence them, to show them that your presence here troubles no ceremony, no faith.

— This is our humble contribution to your struggle.

— Our shared struggle.

— (the bride and groom in unison) Thank you.

— (all in unison) Long live the newlyweds! Long live the newlyweds! 

The Sans-Papiers throw rice at the bride and groom.

— So we’re just throwing rice at people?

— Yeah, kèh! It’s traditional.

— Strange kind of tradition, dèh!

— It brings good luck.

— Back in Kayes, if you threw rice on the floor at a wedding, I swear someone would put a curse on you that your descendants would still be hearing seven generations later.

— Wallaye billaye, back home, we’d gather up all the rice lying in the sand before the bride and groom even left, sift it, and sell it at the market straightaway!

— Long live the bride and groom! Long live the bride and groom!

 

THE ENEMY 

Families, spokespeople, the parish priest, the panel of mediators, supporters, anti-racist organizations, housing associations, legal aid associations, family aid associations, Christian associations, left-wing unions, far-left-wing groups … A common goal is not enough to unite such a motley crew. To bring together this melting pot, an enemy is needed. And the more loathsome the enemy, the stronger the bond against him. The rank of chief of police is guaranteed to bring these disparate groups into solidarity with the Sans-Papiers. 

— “Father, since June 28, some two hundred and fifty foreign nationals, including a number of families with young children, have been occupying the Church of Saint-Bernard de la Chapelle. On July 5, a dozen of these people announced their decision to go on a hunger strike. These events have been unfolding in a space to which our services have, thus far, been unable to gain access. I have therefore requested that a doctor from emergency medical services visit each day. It is my duty to ensure that the doctor can carry out his work under the best possible conditions, and I feel I must draw your attention to your responsibility, as the custodian of the building, to ensure that the health of these people is not compromised at any time. Yours, et cetera, yada yada yada … Philippe Massoni, Chief of Police.”

Silence and shared glances. 

And suddenly … gales of laughter. 

— Ako “ensure that the health of these people is not compromised.”

— The chief of police is worried about us!

— The guy just wants us to take care of our health!

— We should tell him he’s the one who usually makes us sick.

— Leg problems …

— From trudging back and forth to the police station.

— Back trouble …

— From standing for hours in front of the station in the freezing cold or the blazing sun.

— Heart disease … 

— From the emotional roller coaster! One day a letter arrives and tells you you’re “documented,” the next day another comes and you’re “undocumented.”

— Though you haven’t done anything, not even lifted a finger.

— Bowel problems …

— There’s no one who can tie our stomachs into knots like him. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve nearly shit myself at the sight of a cop.

More laughter. 

 

THE SQUARE 

The further the summer trails on into August, the emptier Paris becomes⁠—at least the parts of Paris that go on vacations. Despite its gold plated name, the area called the Goutte d’Or is not among them. Here, demographic shifts in the summer months are all but nonexistent, with the notable exception of the quadrangle occupied by the Church of Saint-Bernard de la Chapelle. Those who went on vacation in July are back⁠—the supporters, the curious, the rubberneckers … They’re all here, all those who rallied to the cause.

The tourists are here too. After the Louvre, the Tuileries, the Place de la Concorde, the Eiffel Tower, the Champ-de-Mars, the Trocadéro, the Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe, and the Sacré-Coeur, the Church of Saint-Bernard de la Chapelle of the Sans-Papiers has become a stop-off on the tourist circuit that comes just before a visit to Jim Morrison’s grave in Père-Lachaise cemetery. The church’s gargoyles are compared to those of the Notre-Dame. People point to the angels set into niches in the pillars and the statue of Christ above the main arch. They wax lyrical about the Coronation of the Virgin on the south transept and Christ’s Resurrection on the north.

The rue Affre separates the church from a public square, which once gave the neighborhood the feel of a village and has now been transformed into a pitched camp for troops of all kinds. Onlookers trample the sickly lawns. The same fate befalls the thickets of nettles and the young snowberry bushes. The August sun is not kind to plants, nor to the people who huddle as best they can in the shade of the linden trees, gazing westward toward the church, as though … waiting.

In the same square, journalists have set up their headquarters under a giant concrete mushroom. Urban planners in the sixties planted these fungi at the feet of tower blocks and housing projects. The journalists wear their badges arrogantly, almost ostentatiously, marking themselves out from the many intelligence officers and plainclothes detectives mingling with the crowd.

The concrete mushroom stands in a strategic position. A few journalists climb on top to get a bird’s-eye view of the church door, zoom lenses primed and ready. Like a zoo’s visitors on the path that runs past the cage of the rarest animal, people are pressed shoulder to shoulder, straining for a look. There is little movement and curiously little noise. Everyone looks as though they are … waiting.

From behind the metal railings around the church, the Sans-Papiers’ every action is carefully observed, studied and scrutinized with the exceptional empathy and compassion of a gaze that has become accustomed to these people who have been in the news for weeks. It is here that anti-racism, an invention of the eighties, finds its most perfect paradigm. Just as people may hate people simply for who they are, so they begin to love people simply for who they are. The racialized person has no idea what he has done to deserve this rejection or attention. The garish, widely mocked Soninke jacket-over-a-boubou outfit suddenly becomes fashionable among young hipsters. Mothers who have no choice but to sling their babies to their backs in order to do the housework are suddenly lauded by the leading lights of feminism. Every howling Black child, until recently dismissed as a filthy brat, now has hundreds of pairs of hands vying to comfort him. SOS Racisme, the association that calls racism to the rescue, or comes to the rescue of racism (impossible to know what it would mean otherwise), is the standard-bearer of the cause. Its logo is a yellow hand emblazoned with the patronizing slogan “Hands off my homie!” On headbands, banners, flyers, press passes, yellow hands proliferate. All the people gathered here, immobile in the sweltering summer heat, give the powerful visual impression that they are … waiting.

What are they waiting for? No one really knows, no one can say. A divine intervention that would grant papers to all? Or a diabolical one, a police intervention that would put an end to this crusade? Both possibilities are simultaneously imaginable and unimaginable. Meanwhile, they wait."

    "text": "The air seemed like it might tip into spring at any moment. The girls were playing with Alexandra Lebedev, who went to Catholic school and always stripped off her uniform and ran around half nude as soon as she got to the playground. I peeled pith from orange segments and sat with Mrs. Lebedev as she wolfed down the remains of her daughter’s lunch box. She usually interrogated me nonstop about the Jessens (What do Jan and Sigrid feed the girls for dinner? How often do Sigrid’s parents visit? Does DiCaprio really collect Jan’s work?), but now that she had successfully ingratiated herself with my employers, the only thing she wanted to talk about was this sculpture she owned. It was ugly and weird, slender pieces of glass and porcelain brought together by an Italian occultist a hundred years ago and secured so flimsily that they appeared to be bound by his fame alone. It looked like it might’ve fallen apart had no one paid attention to it, and the Lebedevs, who’d inherited it some years ago, hadn’t. But once they became bored enough to start collecting art, they got hip to the dusty old thing. Jan Jessen wanted this austere contraption, and Mrs. Lebedev wanted something by one of the most famous living artists, so they decided on a trade.

The Lebedevs had just attended their first Jessen dinner party. 

“Oh, Ben, the stories! We were dying at the stories the girls tell about you.” 

“What stories?” The three girls were busy digging a hole by the swing set. 

“I can’t do it, I won’t do a good job. Jan does the best impressions. God, something about his accent … By the way, does Sigrid always have her guests sit on those floor cushions?” 

“What stories?” 

Sarah tottered over and pulled on my fingers. 

“Come see my artwork, Benny.” She gestured to a heap of strangled daffodils. 

“I told you not to do that. The park rangers will come get you. Those flowers are for people to enjoy.” 

“I am enjoying them!” She stamped her foot. “Just not when they’re in the ground like that.” I spotted Dot over in the tulips, copying her elder sister. 

“That’s not how you enjoy things, by ruining them,” I said. “They were growing in the ground. Now you’ve ruined them and they’re dead.” 

At the mention of death, her eyes widened. 

“It’s okay, Sarah,” Mrs. Lebedev said softly. “Ben just means don’t do it again.” 

“Is it fine?” I said. “How would you feel if someone ripped up all the flowers in the world?” 

Mrs. Lebedev started to gather her daughter’s things. 

“Wait,” I said. “What stories?” 

“Alex!” Mrs. Lebedev called. “We’re going now!” 





When we got back to the loft, Sigrid was already home, wearing what appeared to be a washed linen sack and working on her laptop at the kitchen island. The girls’ backpacks and shoes exploded across the living room and they scampered away. 

“Hey,” I said, pulling out a barstool. “What are these stories the girls are telling about me?”

Sigrid laughed. “You know how children are. So hard to impress. So easy to impress upon!” She closed her laptop, padded over to the fridge, and removed carrots, celery, and onions to dice into a Bolognese. 

“But what kinds of things are they saying?” 

She waved a large organic carrot in the air. “It means they like you, if they can spin this stuff out of nothing. Feel free to take off, by the way. I’ve got the girls tonight⁠—Jan has an opening.” 

On the elevator ride down, I racked my brain for anything the girls might have picked up on. Dot had recently asked me why we swallow our food. Sarah had started to warn old people to be careful or they might die. Until now, I’d hardly believed that they could think, let alone create and then conceal elaborate lies about my life and my character. 

My girlfriend, Webb, confirmed my fears. It was basically impossible for children to distinguish between reality, memory, dreams, television⁠—anything that floated by might be sucked up and warped by their sponge brains. 

“This is dangerous,” I said. “Something has to be done. How do we snap them out of it?” 

“They’ll just grow up and repress it.” 

Webb was also an artist: a much more successful one than me, though not necessarily more, I guess, seeing as I had no success. She was just successful. Before art, Webb had been a distress investor. Then she fell for me and my paintings, and decided to give it a whirl herself. 

“Why are you freaking out about it?” she said. “They probably just have a crush on you. It’s normal.” Webb pulled me onto the bed and coaxed my head between her shoulder and neck. She smelled like turpentine and banana blossoms. “Are you sure you don’t want to come to Italy?” 

“I can’t. I have to work.” 

“They can’t find another sitter? I’ll cover your flights.” 

“I mean my painting.” 

“Oh. The big one.” 

“You don’t like it.” 

“No, I do. I love all your paintings. It’s just so …” I tried to remove my head from her crook, but she locked me in. “So dark.”

“Dark?” 

“Not dark. Intense. Hostile.” 

I could feel her heart pumping in her neck. 





At snack time I halved the girls’ grapes, poured Goldfish into two plastic bowls, and made sure they had the same amount of apple juice. 

“Why are you telling lies about me, guys?” 

“Me don’t know what you’re talking about, Benny.” 

“It’s I,” Sarah said, glancing at me for approval. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” 

Dot smiled and breathed loudly into her scratched plastic cup. 

No matter how much I tried to squeeze the girls, I couldn’t get a drop out of them. “Please,” I said. “If you guys are making stuff up about my life, that could actually get me in trouble. Do you want to get me in trouble?” Dot made a diabolical squish face. 

“You tell lies about us all the time,” Sarah said. 

“Yeah, like what?” 

We heard jingling keys and the click of the lock, and a moment later, Jan was home. He was as monumental and brutally elegant as his art. One huge fist was double-wrapped with the dog’s leash⁠—Muffi at the end of it, yapping and straining for the girls⁠—and in his other hand was a long cardboard box, roughly the size of a rolled-up yoga mat. 

Dot launched herself toward him. “What’s in the box, Papa?” 

“Hey, hey, hey,” he said, dropping Muffi’s leash and angling the box away. “Careful! This is that sculpture from the Lebedevs I was telling you about.” 

“Let me see!” Dot cried, scrabbling at her father’s pant leg. 

“Forsigtig!” Jan said, trying to shake her off. “Control her, Ben?” 

Sarah leaped down from her stool and pawed at Jan too. Muffi, excited by the antics, began to bark. 

“Guys! Come here!” I said pointlessly. I went to pry Dot off Jan, but as soon as I got close to them, Jan issued some other terrifying Danish command and the girls immediately dropped their hands and heads. Jan placed the box on a cabinet shelf out of the girls’ reach, puffed his cheeks out with a big breath, and turned to me. “Okay. Time,” he said, in the same tone my old psychoanalyst had used to conclude our sessions. 

On my way home, I tried to remember my old babysitters: Katja, who would raid our fridge and my mother’s cosmetics. Old Linda, who insisted on folding the laundry, doing the dishes, and walking the dog, though my mother begged her not to. She quit after I screamed at her for giving me a glass of slightly warm water. And then there was Amy, who drove me around in her battered white Jeep, clicking her long fake nails on the dash as she pushed scratched mixtapes in and out of the CD player. Sometimes Amy wept as she drove. She would turn up the volume on the stereo, as if I couldn’t tell what was happening if the music was loud enough. Then Amy started training to be a police officer. Together we ran an eight-minute mile, scaled a six-foot wall. One day she passed the exam. But those weren’t stories. They were just facts. 

 



A small gallery was putting an old painting of mine into a group show. The dealer had kept asking if Webb was coming to the opening. 

“The beer is warm,” Webb said, crinkling her can and squinting at the walls. “This stuff is very in right now, huh. Small-scale, perfectly serviceable Doig rips.” And then, quietly: “I’m so glad you don’t paint like that, baby.” 

There was a tug at my arm. Sarah shoved a bundle of hand-picked flowers at my crotch. In a manic spell of pride and optimism, I’d invited the Jessens to the opening. “Kiss me, Benny. Kiss me,” Dot said. She always wanted a kiss on the mouth. I offered my cheek, but this time she grabbed my collar and whispered, “Is that your girlfriend?” 

“Yes,” I whispered back. “Do you want to meet her?” I hoisted Dot up so she could stare into Webb’s face. 

“Ben said you were a millionaire,” she said. “But you don’t look like a millionaire.” The adults laughed. Webb frowned and looked at me. 

“I never said that!”

I put Dot back on the floor. My gallerist swept over, delighted by the hobnobbing, and popped the secret champagne. He poured each of us a scanty glass. 

“Picture?” he cried. “Picture in front of the painting?” 

We posed for a picture in front of my painting. Dot and Sarah beamed front and center, while Sigrid and Webb linked arms and Jan and I hovered beside them. 

“Perfect!” the gallerist said, putting his phone in his pocket. 

“What do you think?” I asked Jan while the women chatted. 

“It is a painting that is trying to do something,” he said, running his right hand over his blond stubble. “But is it good to do something?” 

“I’m doing something completely different now.” 

“Hm. Colors are a bit weird. A bit flattish.” He mashed his bottom lip into his upper and looked around the room, nodding. “It is nice it is not too busy here. You can look at all the paintings. Usually the openings are so crowded.” His eyes brightened when they landed on the girls. “What do you girls think of Ben’s painting?” He winked at me. 

Sarah paused and mimicked her father’s upper-lip grimace. “It’s okay,” she said. Jan’s attention had already veered into the nearby discussion of Webb’s big solo show. 

“Me have to go potty,” Dot said. I waited for her father or mother to do something. 

“I can take her? If you want?” They didn’t respond. 

I stuck Dot into the stall and, when she was done, plopped her onto the sink. She stuck her hand under the automatic soap dispenser and watched as a portion of pearly soap curled noiselessly into her palm. “Wow,” she said. 

Back in the gallery, a well-known critic who had ignored me all evening stopped and gasped. “Is this your daughter? What’s your name?” 

Dot looked up at me and squeezed my hand. 

“Dot,” I said. “Your name is Dot.” 

 



Webb was upset about Dot’s comment. “It’s just weird,” she said. “How would she come up with something like that?”

“This is what I’ve been trying to tell you! God knows what else they’re saying!” 

Webb said she had a headache, so I hit up my friend Angel, and he agreed to meet at a bar near my house. Angel was engaged to a beautiful young software engineer, and he was getting his hand tattoos removed for the wedding. He had already gotten his face tattoos removed for his real estate job. Angel had been the star of our class at art school, but now he was very happy he had given up on making art. 

“I never made anything I liked,” he said, dipping two fingers into his Stella and running them across the bluish scars on his other hand. 

“Were you trying to?” 

“To be honest, I never saw anything I liked, either.” 

He kept buying me beers. Or I made him keep buying me beers. After three pints of his fiancée and his job, he seemed to expect me to share something in return. “I was picking the girls up from school the other day,” I said, “and I was on the phone, standing in this line they make all the parents and sitters wait in until the gates open, complaining to my mom about Webb and the art world, and this huge fight we had about her trip. Or maybe it was you?” 

“It was me,” Angel said. “You were being depressing as fuck.” 

“And you were telling me to go back to school or get my real estate license or some bullshit. Like, I can’t even sell my art!” 

“What’s the price point again?” 

“Don’t worry about it.” I swallowed a belch. “Anyway. I go to pick up the girls and find Dot sitting on the field, staring up at the sky. She’s one of those kids who’s always looking up. She doesn’t have to look at the ground in front of her, that’s my job. I finally get her to budge, I count to ten, I grab all her crap⁠—macaroni art, lunch box, scooter, helmet, jacket⁠—and this woman stops me and says, ‘I just happened to overhear your phone conversation and I want to let you know I just went through the same thing. It’s hard but it gets better.’ And she’s touching my arm now, by the way. She lowers her voice, so her daughter can’t hear. ‘My ex is also an artist. They’re the worst parents. I’m Louise.’ ” 

“So?” 

“So she thinks I’m someone else. She thinks I lead a very different life.” 

“I’m not getting the meaning,” Angel said. 

“I mean she thinks they’re my kids and that I’m getting divorced and everything.” 

“Thinks?” 

“I see her at the park now. The kids play together.” 

“And when she finds out you’re just the babysitter?” 

“I’m gonna tell her,” I said. “But I basically am like their father. I spend more time with them than he does.” 

We sat in silence, alternately sipping our beers and watching the bartender squeeze limes. 

At 2 A.M. I stumbled home to our quiet street. What a crazy thing we’re caught up in, I thought. Pretending to make art. Pretending not to make it! It just goes on and on. 

The front door was dead bolted, so I called Webb to let me in. She was awake, of course⁠—she usually worked at night, but instead of a brush in her hand she held a clothes hanger. 

“What are you doing?” 

“I told you. Prepacking.” 

“Why the fuck was the door locked?” Something about the lock had made me insolubly angry, and suspicious, plus the way she gulped her glass of water, spilling it down her front. Webb’s dressing gown was open, and her face was splotchy and red. “This is my house, too. You can’t just lock me out when you feel like it.” 

“It’s actually not your house,” she reminded me. 

Our room was a mess, twisted entrails of clothes on the bed, two huge suitcases splayed out. 

“How am I supposed to sleep with all this shit?” 

“Calm down,” she said. “I’m moving it.” She picked up an armful of stringy clothing and dropped it into one of the suitcases. “Why are you in such a mood?” 

“What mood? I’m not in a mood.” 

“Aren’t you happy about your show? It’s nice the Jessens came.” 

“Why is that nice? Why wouldn’t they come?”

“I don’t know. They’re busy. They have kids. Why are you being difficult?” 

“I’m being normal,” I said. 

 



Spring burst like a painfully slow and leaking orgasm. Louise and I usually just bumped into each other at school and let the girls float us in the direction of the park. But on Thursday night, she texted to ask if we were free Friday afternoon, and the next day, she showed up at the gates with a big basket hanging off her bangled forearm. “It’s the first day of spring!” she said. “I thought, Why not a picnic?” At the playground, the girls descended on the basket and, discovering only adult foods⁠—pungent cheeses, quince jam, artisanal crackers⁠—were horrified. “Why don’t you guys go play?” I suggested. “Look, the sandbox is freshly raked.” 

“Ben’s brain is freshly raked.” Dot giggled and sprinted toward the sandbox. Louise’s daughter headed for the slide and Sarah for the monkey bars. 

“It’s funny they call you Ben,” Louise said. 

“They’re sassy.” I took a rosemary cracker and used it to shovel up some soft cheese. “This is really nice, by the way. Thanks.” Louise lifted her sunglasses so I could see the smile ripple up to her eyes. 

“I brought hard cider too,” she said. “Not the sweet kind. We have⁠—I guess I should say I have, now⁠—a place upstate and I buy it directly from the orchard.” She poured some cider into a paper cup and held it out for me. I went to take it and paused. 

“I have to be careful,” I said. “I’ve got a bunch of open-container tickets, I’ll be arrested if I get another.” Her lips started to move but she said nothing. “Kidding,” I said and took the cup. We chatted about her childhood in Maine, the renovations on the upstate house, summer plans. The other adults glared at us with mixed jealousy and appreciation. 

“This is so nice,” I repeated. “My ex and I never did stuff like this.” 

“Really?” 

“Well, she’s a workaholic. At some point her career took off and I got stuck with the girls. And then she went on this trip to Italy to receive a big award. She met this rich Italian collector there. We’d both known it was over even before she left. We were just so competitive … there was a lot of insecurity. I don’t think she really respected me or my work.” 

“I don’t even know what you do for work!” 

“I raise the girls,” I said, and Louise made a noise of sympathy. The gate to the playground clanged and Mrs. Lebedev walked in, pushing Alex’s big stroller. She wheeled right past us and I made a point not to look at her. Louise poured more cider and plunged into her usual theme: the cheating, the deceit, the custody battle. 

“It was just a bad, bad marriage,” she said, almost wistfully. “If anyone wanted to be in his life, they had to be like a cardboard cutout, essentially, that he could prop up and take down at will.” 

“I completely understand,” I said. 

“It’s been hard on Bella. Your girls seem to be doing okay, though.” 

I watched Sarah throw herself across the monkey bars. “Children are so light,” I said. “Like there’s no gravity on them yet.” 

“You’re still young!” she said. “There’s no gravity on you yet! Wait.” She squinted in Dot’s direction. “Is something happening over there?” 

Alex Lebedev had ripped off her uniform and plopped herself into the sandbox with another child, a boy with a bruise under his right eye and a toy lightsaber. Dot had a handful of sand poised to be flung in the boy’s face. The adults in the vicinity immediately dialed in to the unfolding situation. I shot up and ran over. 

“What’s going on here, guys?” 

The children froze. The boy with the lightsaber was standing over the remains of what looked like it had been a sandcastle. 

I crouched to meet him at eye level. I felt generous and warm. “Is that Obi-Wan’s lightsaber?” 

“It’s Maul’s, dummy,” he said, not looking at me. 

“Well, how about you battle me instead? I can find a stick.” 

“Pedophile,” he said. 

My heart flapped. I looked around to see if any of the other adults had heard. Mrs. Lebedev was watching intently, one hand shading her face, the other lifting papaya spears from Tupperware to mouth.

“What does that mean? Pellophile?” Dot asked loudly. 

“Shh,” I said. “Bad word. Very bad word. You can’t just call people that.” 

“Can’t call people what?” the boy said. “A PEDOPHILE?” He grabbed a fistful of sand and threw it in my face. Dot shrieked with delight. I had grabbed my own handful of sand when Alex released one long howl and then burst into tears. Parents rose, murmuring and capping their water bottles. Mrs. Lebedev began to march over. The boy smiled and loped off, whacking bushes with his lightsaber as he went. 

“Okay, time to go. We’re gonna go now,” I said, and scooped up a protesting Dot from the sandbox. “Sarah!” She was hanging from the monkey bars by her knees, observing everything upside down. “We’re leaving! Now!” I dragged Dot back to the bench and started stuffing lunch boxes and toys into their backpacks. My brief happiness had been wiped out. 

“Everything okay over there?” Louise said. I turned around and saw Mrs. Lebedev crouched next to Alex in the sandbox, glaring at me. I slung the girls’ backpacks over my shoulder. 

“Why do we have to go?” Sarah cried when she got to us. 

“Because,” I said, taking the girls’ hands. “See you next week, Louise. Sorry.” 

 



I let them have a few sips of my Diet Coke on the bus. Dot had to use two hands to hold the bottle to her mouth. 

“Don’t tell anyone,” I said. They shrugged. They seemed to have forgotten about the incident at the park, and were happily distracted by the forbidden soda. But when we were getting off the bus, I tripped Sarah. Accidentally, with my foot, but as I whirled around to help her, I knocked her in the head with a backpack. 

“Ow!” she wailed. “You hit me!” 

“You’re fine,” I said. “What about me? I might be hurt? The backpack might be hurt from your big head?” Hot, contagious tears rolled, and Dot got going, too. They cried the rest of the way home. Then the elevator in their building got stuck. The wailing and snotting increased⁠—two hysterical little girls and me, trapped in a metal box. Something inside me broke. “Shut up, you spoiled brats!” I screamed. “If you don’t pull it together right now and show me some respect there are going to be big consequences.” I sounded like a real parent, unleashing the kind of fury and spite one reserves for one’s own flesh and blood. The girls stopped crying. The elevator started moving. 

Sigrid was at the kitchen island, crossing and uncrossing her bony feet. “What’s going on?” she said when she saw the girls’ faces. 

“Dot was caught stealing extra gummy snacks from the classroom today, and Sarah tried to undress herself in the middle of the bus,” I explained. 

“You’re lying!” the girls squealed. 

“I’m not lying,” I said. “It’s all true.” 

The girls were sent to their rooms immediately. 

 



For days before Webb’s opening, my lights flickered at the thought of watching her be schmoozed by the power players of the art world, and how she would sparkle and baffle them in return. Now Thursday was here. The girls had been unusually well behaved, and my painting was almost done. I hadn’t seen Louise in a few days. I stood in the direct center of the second bedroom, which we used as a studio, and rubbed some clean paintbrushes over my face, across the tip of my nose, and then along my throat, nipples, and happy trail. Whatever vague concept of truth I had previously tried to represent in pigment had evaded me, not because I lacked skill but because truth simply did not exist, especially not in art. Yes, I told myself, standing before the unstretched canvas, sipping from a jug of martinis Webb had fixed for us, I would try to take the low road. Wherever it led, I would take it, even if there wasn’t a road, even if it was just a dirt path or not even a path at all, a cornfield or a marshy swamp. Or even if, in all likelihood, the path to success was more like one of those human conveyor belts at the airport, I had to allow myself to take it. I pulled out my phone and snapped a picture of my painting. 

“The car’s here.” Webb appeared in the doorway, martini drained. “Is my dress too slutty?” 

Upon arriving, she was whisked away. Several of our friends found me, and we stood clutching glasses of cold white wine by the stem and discussed my girlfriend’s aspirations like they were something she should be punished for. Eventually, they moved outside and spent the rest of the opening there, chain-smoking. I spotted Webb’s gallerist steering her into the little showroom they reserved for important clients. 

I felt a hand on my elbow. “Ben!” 

Louise had a very empty glass in one hand, an almost full one in the other. Her big sunglasses were perched on her head, like she’d just come from the park. A group of Webb’s friends jostled past, sloshing Louise’s wine. 

“I didn’t expect to see you here,” I said. 

Louise’s ex collected Webb’s work, she said, and she had gotten a few paintings in the settlement. Now she wanted to see the new work for herself, to decide whether to sell or double down. 

“What would you do?” she asked. 

“If you love the work, hold on to it,” I said. “But if it’s for investment purposes, sell. The market forces young artists to show while they’re still developing, and they pump the prices, then dump the artists. You end up with supernovas⁠—flashy but without any of the depth that comes from time and hard work. Then the value tanks and they sputter out.” 

Louise raised her eyebrows. 

“But what do I know? I don’t even like art,” I said. 

“Who has the girls tonight?” she asked. Parents loved this question. 

“Sitter,” I said. “Nice young man. An artist. A pretty good one, in fact. Eccentric.” 

“That’s good they have a boy,” she said. “Girls get too attached to young women. They fall in love with them.” 

Louise drifted toward Saying Nothing Nicely, the biggest piece in the show, a neon-bright abstraction, and stood before it enthralled. Webb had struggled with it for months, and I watched as thousands of her brushstrokes entered the divorcée’s brain. 

“Her assistants do most of the work, she just does the finishing touches,” I said. But Louise seemed not to hear me. 

I saw Webb making her way slowly through the crowd. 

“Let’s go outside,” I said. “It’s packed in here.”

We stepped into the summer fog. Louise asked a stranger for a cigarette, lit it with surprising ease, and then waved to the critic who’d snubbed me at my opening. 

I pulled up the picture of my painting. “What do you think of this?” 

She flipped her prescription sunglasses down onto her nose and glanced at the image. “It’s nice,” she said, blowing smoke to the side. 

 

 

Later, at the gallery dinner, I drank glass after glass of champagne. The gallerist sat Webb at the center of the long table, flanked by big collectors and museum curators. None of the name cards had my name, so I took an empty spot belonging to “Tom Lane.” In the moment, I didn’t mind so much. Everybody was so vague about themselves, it was inspiring. The man in perfectly steamed linen seated across from me would not tell me what kind of work he did in Dubai, and kept trying to switch seats to get closer to the center of the table. The slight but high-octane man to my left warned me against trying to sell him anything. People always tried to predict his taste in art, he said, but he was unpredictable. No matter what I said the worst thing that befell me was a concerned stare. The best was laughter. A woman in a blue canvas jumpsuit and thick black-framed glasses finally turned to me and asked me who I was. What I did. 

“I’m an artist.” Her smile slackened. I took a deep breath. “But more importantly, I’m a father. My children have profoundly influenced my work. In fact, I didn’t even make art until I had kids. They clarify everything, but they question everything, too. My youngest asked me once, ‘Is yesterday still real?’ And so I painted Yesterday.” The jumpsuit woman loved this. 

Back home, Webb sat on the floor, struggling to zip her overstuffed luggage. Her flight was in a few hours. 

“Who was that woman you were talking to outside?” She wadded a bikini string into her suitcase. 

“A mom from the playground,” I said. 

She shot a funny look through the darkness. “You were talking to her for a while.”

“You were busy. Does it matter?” Webb was now sitting on top of the hard plastic shell. “You’re bringing a lot of stuff for such a short trip,” I said. 

“Not really.” 

She guided the zipper the last few inches and crawled into bed. In the morning, I pretended to be asleep when she kissed me goodbye. 

 

 

Dot and Sarah crouched before me expectantly. I saw tiny reflections of myself in their shining eyes. 

“Why are you so sleepy, Benny? Don’t you want to have fun?” 

“Please,” I begged from my position on the couch. “Go play. Watch TV. I don’t care. My head hurts.” 

“Are you sad your girlfriend is going away?” 

“Yes, she’s gone now. To Italy,” I said. 

“What’s Italy?” 

“You guys went there last summer, remember. Pasta. Pizza. Rocks.” 

“Why aren’t you going to Italy?” 

“Because I have to work.” 

“Why?” 

“Because I have to make money.” 

“Why?” 

“Because I’m an artist. You came to my opening, remember?” 

“You’re not an artist! Papa’s an artist. You’re our barnepige!” Dot cackled. 

“Your barn pig?” 

Sarah flashed her sister a look. “Why do you babysit us if you’re an artist, Ben?” 

“Because I don’t make any money from my art.” 

“Because you’re color-blind?” Sarah asked. 

I sat up and stuffed a pillow behind my back. “How did you know that?” 

“It’s obvious. You always give me the wrong lunch box. I have the red one. And when we try to organize our Magna-Tiles, you always mix them all up.” 

“Don’t tell anyone about that,” I said. 

“Why not?” 

“Because it’s private.” Webb thought I shouldn’t tell anyone about my color-blindness, that it would disinherit the intent from my work. I didn’t necessarily think I had any intent in the first place. 

The afternoon morphed into a chase-the-screaming-girls-around-the-house kind of day. War, in other words, and at some point I just let them win. I locked myself in Jan’s study, lay down on his futon with a blanket over me, and faced the Lebedevs’ sculpture. I examined it from all angles, hoping it would speak to me. 

The living room had become awfully quiet. I found the girls on the couch, curled into each other like sleeping snakes. I lay down on the floor cushions next to them and fell asleep. I dreamt about becoming beautiful through naughtiness. 

I woke to Jan shaking my shoulder. The girls were playing in their rooms, and he let me go home early. I wanted to use the raw, ragged edge of my hangover to my advantage and paint through the night, but Jan rang as soon as I got there. 

“What happened to the sculpture?” he said. 

“What?” 

“It’s smashed in a thousand pieces. Didn’t you know?” 

“I would have told you if something broke.” I let Jan and Sigrid know if I so much as chipped a mug. 

“The girls know not to go in there and mess with my stuff !” Even through the throat potatoes of his Scandinavian accent, he was terrifying. “Did you go in there?” 

“Just for a few minutes. Maybe the dog knocked it over?” 

“Muffi was at the studio with me.” 

“Well, I don’t know what happened then.” 

“What do you know, Benjamin?” 

In the background, just before he hung up, I heard the coin-smash trill of Sarah’s iPad game and her little voice: “It was him, Papa.” 

 

 

Louise called over the weekend. 

“Are you doing anything tonight? Bella is with her dad. Do you want to meet for a glass of wine? Or come over?” she asked.

I pictured her apartment. Kitchen island, Cloud couch, Webb’s paintings on the walls. 

“How about you come to mine?” I said. 

“Are the girls asleep?” 

“Oh,” I said. “Hm. Maybe I should come to yours.” 

“Is that fine, to leave the girls?” 

“I do it all the time,” I said. 

Louise gave me her address and hung up. Her apartment was in one of those leafy, bistro-y neighborhoods near the girls’ school. It occurred to me that I didn’t know how old Louise was exactly. She looked good enough for me to not really wonder about it, but now I did wonder. I wondered about her ex-husband too, how old he was, what he looked like, and what kind of art he made. Both Webb and Louise had made their big moves, I realized: Webb with her career, and Louise with her divorce. They could glide forward freely. 

I walked into the studio and looked at my painting. I decided not to go see Louise. Instead, I called Webb. 

“Ben!” Webb yelled into the phone. “I’m on a yacht! Is everything okay?” 

“Mostly,” I said. 

“I miss you already! What are you doing? Did you finish your painting?” I heard something like color coming from her end of the line, it was so bright in Webb’s Italy. I heard water, wind, music, dancing, singing, clowning. 

“Yeah, I finished it,” I lied. 

She gasped. “Oh my God. I can’t wait to see it, but I’ve really got to go now! I love you!” 

I stared at my painting awhile longer. It seemed to say nothing, not even in an eloquently silent way. I raised my brush to the canvas and made one mark, then another, then stopped. 

Then I did finally go to Louise’s. 

 



On Monday, when I brought the girls home from school for the last time, Sigrid’s clogs were set neatly next to the door and her purse was hung up, but she wasn’t at the kitchen island. I made the girls their snack plates and we ate and watched a show. Sigrid came out of the bedroom and assumed her position on the barstool as I loaded the dishwasher. 

“The girls are going to miss you, Ben.” 

“Where do they think I’m going?” 

Dot scrambled over and climbed onto my lap. Once there, she turned and looked at me for a long time without blinking. “Why do you tell people you’re our papa, Ben?” 

“I don’t tell anybody that,” I said. 

“Yes, you do.” Sarah appeared beside me, her golden head bowed. 

Sigrid freed us with her nervous laughter. “Sometimes that might be easier than explaining who Ben is, sweetie.”

    "text": "The twins were strolling around the lake with their sage, Jimmy. This was a little joke they shared, for he was not their sage. He was the son of their croquet coach from long ago and had been with them now for many years as friend and indispensable companion. 

The twins were Camilla and Candida. Camilla’s name was precept, a concept, coming from a long tradition, Virgil’s warrior girl, beautiful, virginal, agile, strong, and valiant, who fights on the wrong side, performs prodigies of bravery, and though defeated inspires passionate regard in the opposing heroes. Candida, on the other hand, was a parasite, a fungus, was it not? Despite the grave differences their names suggested, they appeared identical and Jimmy could scarcely tell them apart. 

They were passing along a purplish muddied finger of the lake. Leeches lay about in turgid harmony. 

“It must be terrible to want to have pretty ways and not have pretty ways,” Candida mused, regarding the leeches. “You know, they perform an elaborate courtship display before mating. We’ve never witnessed it ourselves. We read about it in a scientific journal.” 

“It would be difficult to descry, I imagine,” Jimmy said. “You’d have to know what you were looking at.” He’d been fond of annelids as a boy. He liked cutting them up to marvel at their bilateral symmetry. But the worms of his boyhood had been more modest. These things were a sizzling chili red and long as baguettes. He discerned jaws. They would brook no cutting up. 

Jimmy carried an insulated backpack that held their traditional picnic lunch⁠—several bottles of white wine and a pan of lemon squares. Their destination was the twins’ old playhouse, which had been relocated here and was of great significance to them. 

With the playhouse in sight they began speaking of their childhood: The school holidays when they traveled from the East to their daddy’s ranch in Wyoming, to the sheep-cropped grasslands of the Powder River Basin. The Thanksgiving they discovered that the cowboys were merely Daddy’s accountants decorated with chaps. The Easter morning they had their first menses simultaneously, riding the Appaloosas Jones and Dow. The evening they were told how immeasurably rich they were because Daddy owned the largest coal-bed methane drilling company in Wyoming, consequently in the nation and the world. 

Jimmy had heard all this before but never tired of their conversations. Their impeccable boarding school drawls always pleased him, as did their upper-class slouches and twitches. 

“We called Daddy Midas,” Camilla said. “Everything he touched turned into some ghastly energy source.” 

“The scarring, the erosion, the desertification and waste of trillions of gallons of water …” Candida said faintly. 

“One can hardly think of it in terms of gallons it was so much water,” Camilla said. “A gallon is what you might take on a walk like this, around a lake.” 

Jimmy had packed no water but he never packed water. 

The twins had long harbored the desire to murder their father and make the modest point that greed and desecration do not always go unpunished. But the old man had died of cardiac arrest reaching for his favorite egg cup in one of his many houses’ elaborate kitchens. His death provided little satisfaction. Their daddy had been a common capitalistic nihilist as had their granddaddy. It was their great-granddaddy that disturbed the twins the most, however. He had been instrumental in the ruination of Kansas on his way to Wyoming, enthusiastically participating in the Slaughter, when all animal life was being extinguished by guns and strychnine. Even the hardened generals touring the vast devastated prairie said they’d never seen such a putrid waste. Just bones and hail striking and skittering off the bones. 

Jimmy stumbled against a root but heard no crack of crystal against the lemon square pan, thank God.

“Remember the Christmas we brought home the recording Songs of the Humpback Whale and played it and played it and played it until Daddy practically went apeshit?” Camilla said. 

The twins wore identical dark skirts, sweater sets, and pearls as well as black high-tops, though Candida’s were a half size larger. 

“Imagine, after eleven months in the womb, to be born to no nest, no lair, no room, but to just the great home shadow of the mother …” Candida shuddered. 

“We had hoped he would have been moved, even if not profoundly moved, by nature’s hidden ecstatic adagio, but were not terribly surprised when he was not. Still, we were pleased by his considerable discomfort and irritation.” 

Jimmy had missed them so when they were away at school. He had become practically catatonic. That was almost fifty years ago now. 

“Clasp in back, dear,” Camilla said, adjusting her sister’s strand of pearls. “How does it manage to work its way around like that?” 

“Remember the little calves?” Candida said. “Remember how their mothers behaved? They behaved most unnaturally. They flung themselves against barbed wire before the births. They did not lick their children clean or hasten to nurse them. They …”

“Those were Daddy’s hobby veal calves,” her sister said. “He trucked them over personally to that chef in Jackson and the man made creamy little medallions of them and served them on big black plates.”

Candida looked pained. “We were forbidden to make pets of them.” 

“But he did let us have the prairie dog. Remember that, Jimmy? The whole colony had been gassed but this little fellow hung on⁠—oh, only for a day or two⁠⁠—but we enjoyed him so. We sang the little song to him that Ratty hears in The Wind in the Willows. ‘Lest the awe should dwell⁠—And turn your frolic to fret⁠—’⁠ ” Camilla warbled, “ ⁠‘You shall look on my power at the helping hour⁠—But then you shall forget!’⁠ ”

“Chapter seven,” Candida said. “⁠ ‘The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.’⁠ ” 

Jimmy shuffled along behind them. They had almost reached their belvedere, the playhouse. He would unlock the massive door wrenched from some sixteenth-century monastery, set the table, pour the wine, serve the squares, and Time⁠—the severe concept of which had always troubled him⁠—would share the banquet as friend and accomplice. 

The playhouse had an antler chandelier, bearskin rugs, and mirrors everywhere rimmed with the teeth of wolves. 

“How we loved this place.” Candida sighed, settling in. “We felt no guilt about the decor at all. Most children realize guilt at the age of two or three but we …” 

“In the third year of life guilt appears,” Jimmy said. 

“But we didn’t come to guilt until we were twenty,” Camilla said. She took a long swallow of wine. “This is an excellent white, Jimmy. Racy.” 

“And we adored it!” Candida said. “So much more intriguing than boys. Guilt just got to looking better and better to us. It became this handsome, loyal, thoughtful companion, rather like a German shepherd.”

“Nothing alarms the moneyed class more than a powerful sense of guilt,” Camilla said.

“Our friends thought we had lost our minds. They were so concerned they attempted to do what was then called an intervention.”

Jimmy gazed at them raptly.

“We all gathered in a condominium, it was supposed to be for a baby shower, and we thought, Yvette? A baby? You can’t be serious! But we brought a gift, one of those bouncy things you hang from a rafter and put the little creature in and they just bounce and bounce and bounce and bounce happily for hours, but Yvette was not with child at all. It was a ruse and the doors were bolted and they all started in on us.”

“We didn’t crack,” Camilla said. “Never cracked.” 

“But it checked our trajectory, it did! Guilt didn’t strengthen and flourish after that. It came and went. The last time we saw Mummy was at that intervention, Jimmy, isn’t that ironic?” 

Jimmy nodded and poured more wine. Mummy had gone down in a vintage Cessna during a violent thunderstorm, a cowboy with whom she had long been suspected of dallying at the controls. As far as anyone could recall, the young fellow not only had never flown a plane before but had never expressed a desire to do so. 

“Oh repining and despondent mother,” Camilla cried out in an uncertain tone. 

“You are missed, Mother,” Candida said, groping for her sister’s hand.

They drank and nibbled on the lemon squares. 

“Delicious,” Candida pronounced.

Camilla was gazing, not impolitely, at Jimmy’s arm, where a mosquito was busying itself.

“This reminds me of a haiku Issa wrote,” she said. 

“Not his real name,” Candida said. 

“It’s something about how lucky he is to have this year’s mosquitoes biting him again.” 

“He had a most difficult life. He shared a house with people who hated him, relatives of some sort. But then the house burned down.” 

“We studied Issa for years in our haiku period,” Camilla said, “but we were very disappointed in his death poem. It was something about a bathtub.” 

“No,” her twin corrected her, “it was, and I remember this exactly, ‘A bath when you’re born a bath when you die how stupid.’ ”

“Couldn’t have been one of his better ones,” Jimmy said. “Tells us more about him than is probably necessary.” 

The twins continued to gaze at his arm. He once joked that the reason mosquitoes never bothered them was because their blood was too blue. This the twins had found hysterical. 

“They did the man a great disservice by writing that one down,” Jimmy continued. “Threw his entire life’s work into question.” 

Suddenly the twins shivered violently. This was usually in psychic empathy for the unprepared mammals and reptiles run down by Daddy’s seismic exploration crews in their trucks of awesome tonnage, shooting vibration darts through the earth to map gas pockets, trundling over them as if they were gum wrappers. 

“All is so hopeless, I often feel,” Candida observed. “Surely there must be more wine.” 

“Of course, of course,” Jimmy said, hastening to uncork the second bottle or perhaps the third.

“I’ve been thinking,” Camilla said. 

Her sister looked at her gratefully. 

“It’s time to act!” 

“If not now, when,” Jimmy said. This was the moment in these marvelous afternoons when plans would be hatched that held scant promise of execution.

“Indeed. We’re crowding sixty-six.” 

“Oh, it can’t be,” Candida murmured. 

“We must make our move. The destroyers and despoilers and death dealers must pay. We’re going to work with music.” 

“But didn’t we try that once? With Daddy and the whale?” 

“It would be more extreme, more modern. It would work somewhat like this. Those who treasure the land and its denizens will hear the most beautiful music …”

“Or nothing?” Candida said. “Just a suggestion, but it could be that strange tremulous nothing you hear in a seashell when you put it to your ear, for sometimes beautiful music can be such a cliché, which might be rejected by a serious person.” 

“Nothing is fine,” Camilla granted. “We don’t want to make this too complicated. But for the … the rancorous ones, the rancorous ones in general, they would hear continuous sonic dissonances the concatenation of which would drive them mad. Their brains would pop like pimples.” 

“Perhaps there is a way,” Jimmy suggested, “to combine unnerving hidden harmonies with the ultrasonic frequencies emitted by those plug-ins that drive vermin from the home.” 

“This music wouldn’t get rid of them, it would just make them go away?” Candida asked. 

“Yes,” Camilla said. “They would just … go away. Their presence and their capabilities would be incapacitated. They would dither about in ineffectual torment for a time and then just plunge off a cliff and drown or something.” 

“I think I get it,” Candida said. “It’s rather subtle, isn’t it.” She looked nearsightedly past them at what seemed to be a crimson ball. By squeezing her eyes almost shut she saw that it was merely the playhouse’s stained glass window blazing with the setting sun. But by widening her eyes the object became once more a wobbly globe. When was it, B.C., A.D. ? And who had it been who believed the dead returned to life as spheres? The blessed dead, of course, not just everybody … 

Origen. The name came to her and she was pleased. It was he who believed the dead became spheres. And who had Origen been? Some thinker, no doubt. 

Jimmy sighed. Another day was ending and their picnic was winding down. They did this only three or four times a week.

“I don’t feel well,” Candida announced abruptly. 

“Oh darling, no!” Camilla cried. 

“I feel so limpsy. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so limpsy.” 

The twins frequently said they wanted to be the kind that angels feared, though they were pretty fragile actually and had to be protected day and night from various disquietudes. Jimmy quickly gathered up the empty bottles and the pan of lemon squares, which had scarcely been touched. He’d feed them to the fishes. It probably wouldn’t be good for them, but what was anymore? The lake was having some oxygenation problems. 

He followed the twins as they hurried back to the mansion, admiring the straightness of the seams in their stockings and glad he’d already turned down their beds. 

 

 

Just after midnight, Camilla shook her sister awake. “We’re going to act,” she said. “I’ve already called for the car.” 

“Okay,” Candida said. She felt unrefreshed. 

The twins maintained two drivers in constant service but seldom used the car to go anywhere.

“I hope it’s David,” Candida said. 

They favored David over Warren but the driver was Warren. They did not make their disappointment apparent. 

“Warren,” Camilla said, “didn’t we have a horse once who only knew Welsh?”

“He only understood Welsh, yes, miss,” Warren said. “He was a difficult one.” 

“What was that horse’s name?” Candida said. 

“Neb,” Warren said. “That’s ‘nobody’ in Welsh. Or ‘anybody’ in Welsh. It can mean either one. He had the hiraeth all right.”

“And what is that, this hiraeth?” 

“The word for the mysterious longing of the Welsh, that straining, that yearning, that craving, that madness to break through! Desire but not ordinary desire. Desire driven against custom, against habit, driven against the cowardice of mankind!” 

The car had not been kept up. Individual ketchup packets were jammed, leaking, into the cupholders and ashtrays. The carpets were worn. Small corroded batteries knocked about beneath their feet. 

“How is your wife, Warren? And the children,” Candida inquired.

“That’s David, miss. David has the wife and boys.” 

“I see. And how are they?” 

“I wouldn’t know, miss. Where are we headed, miss?” 

“How long have you been with us, Warren?” 

“Eleven years, miss. It will be eleven next Tuesday exactly.”

“And what have you learned in that time?”

“Goodness, miss, I don’t know. I’ve had my sorrows and I’ve dealt with them. You know what they say, no man could endure life if he knew what was ahead of him. I hope you’ve found me reliable. If you have any misgivings about my …”

“No, no, David.” 

“It’s Warren, miss.” 

Candida gave the driver’s seat a terrific kick. Dust rose from the fabric. 

“How does everything seem to you?” Warren asked a little fearfully. 

“Sorry,” Candida said. 

“I would like to say that people think highly of you both. ‘Those girls,’ they say, and they say it fondly.” 

“We comport ourselves well and have pleasant personalities, is that what you’re suggesting?” 

“Yes, miss.” 

“Take us to the slaughterhouse,” Camilla said. “That’s where we’re going,” she assured her sister. 

“That’s heavily guarded, miss. It’s an essential industry with an armed perimeter.” 

“I want to go,” Candida said petulantly. She was impressed by her sister’s decision and not surprised. She had only pretended to read The Jungle as a child, whereas Camilla had been honestly engrossed in Upton Sinclair’s deeply unliterary masterpiece, much to the amusement and faint disgust of their teacher.

“Where is the weapon in this vehicle?” Camilla asked. 

“In the glove box, miss.” 

“Hand it over.” 

The sisters stared at it. It had a rich and disturbing smell. 

“What is it?” Candida demanded. 

“A Glock, miss.” 

“Fine, good,” Camilla said. “Now, where is the nearest slaughter‑house?”

“Seventeen miles. There’s a larger facility in forty-two.” 

“Take us to the closest one. We’re not feeling well.” 

The plant was in a valley and as brightly lit as Jerusalem. 

“You know why this is so easy for us? Because it’s right,” Camilla said excitedly. 

 

 

“Now let me look at you,” Camilla said to her twin. She moistened her fingertip and ran it across Candida’s eyebrows. She straightened her pearls so that the Tiffany clasp was where it should be, squarely at the nape. They were in a squalid little room painted pink, seated before four puzzled abattoir workers in caps and bloody smocks. Beyond the wall, operations had, for the moment, ceased, though the living were still terrified and the dying as well. Cows screamed in the knocking box. Steers hanging from broken legs thrashed and kicked. 

“We’re afraid our Spanish isn’t all it could be,” Camilla said. 

“Though I memorized some poetry a long time ago,” Candida said and began reciting sweetly: 

“ ‘Era la gran reunión de los animales muertos, / traspasados por las espadas de la luz …’ ”*  

The workers, save for one, looked very frightened. 

“That is Federico García Lorca. Now I realize he’s from Spain and not from Mexico …”

Camilla petted her hand. 

“I thought, just to break the ice …” Candida said. 

“We are here because we want this horror to stop,” Camilla said over the racket of management cursing and pounding at the door. “And we hope that our inevitable deaths⁠—that is, my sister’s and my own⁠—might atone in their small ways for the savagery wreaked on the innocent here every hour, every minute of the day.” 

A slight worker with a thin dark face raised his hand, which was missing several digits. “I speak a little English,” he said.

“Excelente,” Candida said.

“Do you mean to stop the butchery or atone for it?” he asked. 

“We realize that we may not stop it this night, but our actions might ensure a different tomorrow,” Camilla said. 

The battering on the door had stopped but the screams of animals⁠—the process of their being destroyed momentarily arrested⁠—continued. 

“This is heartbreaking,” Candida said weakly. “How do you stand it?” 

“In what way does your presence here atone?” the thin man said. “An atonement is a sacrifice offered, but will it be received? And by whom?” He added politely, “I am not questioning your belief.”

“I believe it will be accepted, yes.” 

“In the spirit in which it is given?” 

“More than that alone, I would hope.” 

“Atonement is made by a sacrifice of inestimable value. Its sufficiency is infinite. Your act will be sufficient, then?” the thin man inquired.

Candida said after a pause, “I would like you to ask them if they feel despair.”

He addressed them, a woman and two men. “¿Tristeza?” 

“No, no,” they insisted. 

“No,” he said to the twins. 

“Because despair is only an individual’s lack of vision,” he said. 

“Ask them if they feel sorrow. Do you feel sorrow?” Camilla said. 

She’s not making the slightest impression on them at all, Candida thought sadly, for she had always admired her sister pretty much without qualification. They’re not even looking at us, they’re just seeing the gun. A lesser individual would bargain for their attention by stressing the occupational hazards to their personal well-being⁠—were they aware of the dangers of repetitive motion disorders, dangers that were myriad and could be quite crippling?⁠—but Camilla was making every attempt to go directly into the heart of the matter, though the slim worker who spoke with such gallantry seemed to have bested her in some disturbing way. She moved closer to her sister and was smiling at her reassuringly when the door splintered open and figures in riot face shields and bulky body armor lunged into the room. Candida saw Camilla’s head bloom into a gouty poppy and an instant later she, too, left this world.

 

 

The woman’s name was Teresa and back on the line she couldn’t stop talking. She’d never been gifted with an abundance of wits and her chatter usually annoyed her brother, but he was glad to hear it that night. 

“It’s like those two frozen pigs at the other place,” she said. “I told you about those pigs, didn’t I?” 

“Tell me again.” His hands were shaking so badly his gloves weren’t staying on. 

“There were these two frozen hogs in a big pile of frozen chainsawed hogs but they were alive. I saw them lift their heads. Later I saw them again when I was having a smoke and they had managed to move to the edge of the pile but they were still mostly frozen and they were saying, ‘Help me.’ Both of them were saying, ‘You got to do something to help me …’ I’ll never forget them. Or those ladies neither, now I think.” 

 

 

Jimmy would know nothing of this for hours. He turned in his sleep, no more restlessly than usual. "

    "text": "Why does the sun shine? Why does part of the moon go missing and then come back again? How come every flower has its own fragrance, but the grit and pebbles on the street smell of nothing? How can a bird soar through the sky, clearly heading toward town, then without seeming to turn around end up sitting right there in the courtyard? No one told it to chirp and warble, but look at it chirping and warbling its head off. Aren’t you afraid you’ll run out of strength, little birdie? Maybe just perch on a branch and pace yourself. And how about this brick wall, thirty years old and still going strong, keeping the courtyard and the outside world separate at all times, forcing people to use the gate⁠—after all, they can hardly bust straight through it, can they? All manner and all sorts of things⁠—what’s behind them?

How did we end up here?

Time is an infinitely long road, who can say where it begins and ends? Grandpa Liu asked himself these questions when he was young, then again in middle age; now, in his dotage, he asks them even more often, spending his days and nights lost in thought. All life’s great mysteries: Why do people need food, air, shelter? Would it really be a problem not to eat? Will the sky fall if you don’t breathe? Do they throw you in jail for living in the wilderness? Numberless questions, as uncountable as specks of dirt on the ground or grains of sand in the desert. Before they can be answered, more come crashing down, like a house collapsing. 

One morning, Grandpa Liu wakes up and wonders what makes people doze off. What makes their eyes pop open when they’ve had enough sleep? He summons his concentration to work through this question and is about to explain his reasoning to his wife when she abruptly sits up in bed and says, “Let’s have a birthday today, both of us. I’ll go to the market and get some pork belly.”

“Didn’t we just have a birthday last month?” Grandpa Liu asks.

“So what? Let’s have another and turn a year older.”

“How old are we now?” 

“Ninety-nine.”

“One more till we hit a century!” A smile lights up his face. Grandpa Liu adores his wife and lets her have her way in everything. After breakfast, Granny Liu sets off to the market, ready to celebrate. While she’s out, Grandpa Liu wanders around the courtyard. Spying a table, he asks: Why do you have four legs? Wouldn’t three be enough? As he does the dishes, he asks the bowls: Why are you round? Couldn’t we eat off you if you were square? Before returning the chopsticks to their canister, he holds them up to his eyes: Hey, why are you so long and thin? If you were shaped like balls, couldn’t we make that work too?

He digs down to the very root of each issue. Why are chopsticks long? And the water in the tank⁠—what makes it warm in summer and icy in winter? He steps into the yard and sees three run-down sheds, two persimmon trees, plants and vegetables. Tomatoes and green beans take up half the courtyard. The plants are plantlike, the vegetables vegetable-like, and the tomatoes and beans look exactly like tomatoes and beans. The combined efforts of the two persimmon trees repel the July sun, leaving the courtyard as shady as if it were late winter or early spring, as if the air-conditioning from the shops and bank lobbies in town had wafted over. Grandpa Liu stands by the vegetable patch gazing at the trees, then goes over to the trees and stares at the vegetables. The spinach is a tender green with a faint yellowish hue. The chives are overgrown and inky, every blade bent in a crescent shape, flowering stalks rising above dark leaves. Each tomato plant is supported by a wooden tripod, every forked branch sprouting. Red tomatoes, green tomatoes, tomatoes taking tentative steps from green to red, some the size of an egg or a fist, all of them pale to begin with. 

Green beans have covered an entire courtyard wall with writhing vines.

Before leaving, Granny Liu asked, “Should I buy vegetables at the market?” “Yes, let’s spare ours,” Grandpa Liu answered. She nodded in agreement, picked up her basket, and sauntered through the gate into the street, into time, every pace yet another step on the path of her limited span on earth. Grandpa Liu looks at the vegetable garden he planted with such dedication: lush spinach, abundant cabbages, tomatoes clustered like plump grapes all but snapping the branches with their weight. The beans will swarm the courtyard walls till they come crashing down.

That’s time, slipping away second by second, minute by minute. Grandpa Liu ruminates, asking many essential questions and gradually finding answers:

So long as you don’t cut the chives, they’ll sprout and flower.

So long as sturdy trellises hold them up, tomatoes will cluster in midair.

So long as you pick off the bugs and give the cabbages water and fertilizer at regular intervals, they will germinate and put forth leaves that curl around a heart, becoming robust enough by autumn that you could dance a jig on them. 

Once these answers are clear as one plus one equals two, Grandpa Liu uses the same principles to work his way through others. He understands that if the wall stays standing, it will continue to shield their courtyard from prying eyes. If time limps from July to August, from August to September, the persimmons will get larger each day, until, without warning, dangling red globules will sear the sky, filling the heavens with fiery fruit. Grandpa Liu listens to the bustle of the street outside, the chatter of people hurrying to the market, the neighbors’ car returning and cutting its engine outside their gate. Young Dazhuang gets out and slams the door, pressing the button (click) to lock up the car (clack) and stomping off without interrupting the brash flow of words streaming from his mouth. This sequence of sounds and movements is a chain of logic that Grandpa Liu’s brain wrestles into enlightenment. Neighbor Dazhuang has money, and has built the town’s most dazzling, most exquisite house. So dazzling and exquisite that the townsfolk call it not a house but a villa. Because he lives in a villa and not a house, Dazhuang had the gall to pay his wife to divorce him⁠—she couldn’t give him children⁠—so he could marry a younger and more beautiful woman. On the day of their divorce, both Dazhuang and his ex were beaming, as if their long battle had ended with a victory on both sides, or as if they’d concluded a business deal. As if Dazhuang had traded a chicken for a duck, and then the chicken who’d never laid an egg had gotten to its new home and started producing one a day, sometimes even double-yolked. Meanwhile, the duck who’d never done a single thing except eat, drink, and strut around waggling its rump got to Dazhuang’s home and laid a clutch of ten or twenty white eggs that then hatched into a gaggle of fine ducklings.

That’s how it was.

That’s how all things are.

The peonies by the vegetable garden, parched to death when they were seedlings, have sprouted green shoots next to their withered forebears; delicate leaves wave on tender stems as golden as the sun, and tiny buds lurk, pouting, ready to blossom, tucked away among the branches. Why did the peonies die and then return to life? Because when the vegetables were watered, the overflow trickled down to their roots. The sun isn’t stingy with its affection but generously pours its radiance wherever it fancies, and so the dead peonies were reborn. The new shoots are much greener and daintier than the old. Moisture, sunlight, and meticulous care, not to mention rich garden soil and fertilizer, nourished them to dark green health; thus does everything in Grandpa Liu’s vegetable garden make a display of well-being, demonstrating the vitality and abundance of youth.

If a person were planted in such rich soil, in this well-fertilized, light-filled vegetable patch, what would happen?

Would they change from elderly to middle-aged, from middle- aged to young?

This last question sends a judder through Grandpa Liu’s body, like on his wedding night fifty years ago, when he first thrust into his wife, sending the whole planet aquiver along with his body. The entire world was full of rapture. Joy echoed in his ears, hills crumbled, the ground cracked apart, wild cries erupted.

Grandpa Liu feels his heart shaking and yelping once more. 

Again his whole body needs to break apart, to burst open and flow freely.




After careful consideration, Grandpa Liu decides to get moving.

Every good thing in this world is the result of action. No one gets to harvest after sitting around idle.

Grabbing his pickaxe, he hacks apart the tomato trellises and flings them aside. With his sickle he slaughters the tomatoes and beanstalks. He slashes and uproots the spinach, cabbages, and chives. Now there’s a space in the vegetable patch the size of a room. He marks a ditch three feet wide and seven feet long. Hoe-ful by hoe-ful, shovelful by shovelful, he digs deep. Dirt piles up on either side. Grayish topsoil nourished by fertilizer. Beneath that, dark red peat. And, farther down, lobes of compacted earth. From the ground comes a fecund reek, dankly fresh. Grandpa Liu’s sweat stinks of manure. With more pondering and questioning, Grandpa Liu reaches a conclusion: the rawness and bountiful goodness of this garden come from the mingled odors of earth and sweat. The freshness of cabbage and spinach, the spicy sweetness of chili, the faint, bright acidity of tomato, the hint of cucumber within the astringency of green beans, all and all of this, all kinds of everything, are the alchemical products of the earth’s natural scent and human perspiration.

Tomatoes don’t smell of tomatoes to start with, not till they’ve created their aroma from this combination.

The chili plant used to be unremarkable, just a spiky weed, but this reek created its tongue-piercing sharpness and its soupçon of sweetness, made it fit for deep-frying and charring with tiger stripes. This soil belongs to Grandpa Liu’s clan, the sweat comes from Grandpa Liu’s body, but he will no longer give this precious fluid to lowly vegetables and plants. He’ll keep it for himself. Yes, he’ll mix his sweat with soil to produce the scent of middle age, mature and able to do whatever it puts its mind to. So full of vigor he could even start a fight, maybe even lead a mob with hoe or meat cleaver raised high. Me? I’m not scared of anyone. Not that he’d kill for real. That’s just how a middle-aged person should be, sharp and full of vitality. Then he’d transform the flavor of middle age into youth, then adolescence. The condition of fearing nothing in the heavens or on earth. Once, when Grandpa Liu was a child, he saw some other children standing together, staring eastward, and he said to them: “Keep going straight and you’ll walk right into the sun.”

The children thought for a second, before linking hands to walk into the sun.

If those children met a mountain, they’d climb it. If they met an ocean, they’d build a bridge.

Young Grandpa Liu had been going to school for only a few days at that point. He’d read a book that said the world was round, and he explained this theory. Two other kids decided that if one of them headed east while the other continued west, as long as they kept going, they’d meet on the other side of the globe. They wouldn’t stop till they bumped heads again. No sooner had he spoken when these two determinedly set off in opposite directions, one heading east while the other continued west, drawing farther and farther apart but also growing closer and closer together, in order to prove studious Young Grandpa Liu correct.

Grandpa Liu knows very well the scents of middle age and youth. He hews his shovel into the ground, strips off his shirt and trousers, keeps working in just his underwear. When he’s exhausted, he leans his bare back against the trench wall. His sweat turns the dirt into sticky mud, reminding him of how, when he was a young man, he would slap wet soil onto his fingers whenever he cut them, grabbing it from the spot trodden with the most footsteps. The trench grows to a foot deep, then two, then three. As he scoops up the dirt, his sharp metal shovel slices through the air like a knife shearing the sky.

The shovel slashes the heavens open and crimson sun oozes out. Amid this redness, Granny Liu returns from the market. She shuts the courtyard gate and is confronted with the carnage of the vegetable patch and a trench flanked by mounds of earth. After a moment frozen in confusion, she scurries over and stares in shock at Grandpa Liu. “What do you think you’re doing?”

He swings the shovel vigorously into the ground and looks up at his wife. “We’ve lived a hundred years, shouldn’t we prepare for what comes next?”

Stunned, Granny Liu ponders the future. She lowers to the ground from the crook of her arm a slab of pork and a bamboo basket containing vegetables, rice, alkaline noodles, salt, vinegar, soy sauce. Squatting, she stares at the pit, now up to Grandpa Liu’s shoulders, its walls a sort of brownish-red, brownish-yellow. In places he has smoothed it to resemble those new houses in town. Elsewhere it is unevenly mottled, like the textured walls the local authorities are putting up everywhere. Grandpa Liu’s shoulders are hunched and his head is pulled back as he looks up at her, his dirt-spackled, sweaty body curled like a gigantic prawn. 

She doesn’t ask if he’s tired. He’s never known the appearance or taste of tiredness.

She stares at him and the pit. “Who goes first?”

Grandpa Liu thinks for a moment. “Me first.”

“Why?”

“Women live longer than men. Men live less long than women. I’ll go first and you can bury me here. Dress me in the finest, most expensive black satin graveclothes you can find, with embroidered hems, and fill my coffin with bronze coins and ingots. Also strong liquor, good cigarettes, and playing cards.” He shares more thoughts as they come to him: the paper house they burn as an offering should be modeled on their neighbor Dazhuang’s villa, but the sedan should be even more magnificent and stately than Dazhuang’s, and since everyone says foreign appliances are best, the paper TV, fridge, and washing machine should be marked GENUINE OVERSEAS PRODUCT. Most importantly, he’s never fully understood why the earth is round. Seeing as it is round, how come when his playmates set off to the east and west, planning to meet on the other side of the planet, they walked their entire lives but never came back? What’s with that? Maybe the earth is flat after all. Which means that his friends certainly won’t meet on the other side. Grandpa Liu has always felt he let them down badly. Now he looks imploringly at his wife and says he ought to die first, and when he’s gone she should go to the funeral supply store and get a flat earth made for his coffin. Should it be square, rectangular, or triangular? No one’s ever made it to the edge, so no one can say what shape the world is. Let the funeral store owner paint whatever kind of earth he imagines, as long as it isn’t round.

Granny Liu doesn’t agree with a word of this. Who says women live longer than men? On every street of Gaotian Town, on every road and in every alleyway, there are men in their nineties, hordes of them sitting in the middle of the road or at street corners in the winter sun or summer breeze. Their alleyway alone has far fewer women in their nineties. Clearly men live longer in this town. Granny Liu squats by the grave and says, “Look, say you’re right and women do live longer, then fine⁠—you can die first, but you’re making lunch tomorrow.”

“Why me?”

“If I have to bury you with my own hands, you could at least cook me a few meals while you’re alive.”

There they are, one below and one above. Stalemate. Granny Liu goes on vociferously arguing that among their neighbors it’s the men who live longer, and now that he’s dug their grave, she’s bound to leave before him one of these days. When she’s gone he’ll have to bury her, and she isn’t as fussy as he is. He can make the arrangements as he chooses, decide how much he can afford to spend on the coffin, clothes, grave goods. She does have one condition, though. She meant to marry a real dreamboat but somehow ended up with Grandpa Liu instead: not particularly tall, with his narrow forehead, just-straight-enough nose, thick lips like hockey pucks. I’ve put up with your unappetizing looks my whole life, she says. When I’m gone, all I ask is that you go to the portrait artist in town and commission a picture of a strapping young lad to go in the coffin next to me.

Grandpa Liu tugs a clod of soil from the wall of the pit and hurls it at her chest.

She is knocked over and sits at the edge of the grave.

“Don’t you pelt me with earth,” she says. “If you’ve got the balls, come up here and smash my head in. Yes, go right ahead, smash my head in with a rock and put me in the ground, then you’ll be stuck here all by your lonesome.”

Grandpa Liu stands stock still in the grave, staring at his wife as he turns dark with rage, nose and eyes twitching, face like a riddle with the wrong answer.




Does lunch count as a birthday banquet? There are a number of dishes, some with meat and others with vegetables, also white rice and egg drop soup. Granny Liu sets little liquor cups by their places as usual. They each pour themself half a cup. They are silent during the meal, like two strangers who happen to be sharing a restaurant table.

Well, not completely silent; each says a few words.

They built their old tile-roofed house forty years ago and now the walls are peeling, the dark brick floor is cracked, and even the ancestral tablets that have been standing on the altar all this time are so faded that you have to peer closely to make out the names and faces. The only thing that hasn’t changed is how cavernous and desolate the big house feels. Amid this desolation, Granny Liu chews ploddingly, her resentment written on her face.

“How about this?” she says. “We’ll draw lots to decide who buries whom.”

Grandpa Liu has his head down, shoveling food into his mouth and downing cups of liquor. After swallowing a mouthful of meat and vegetables, he holds his chopsticks in midair and looks at his wife for a moment. Then he puts down his bowl, slaps his chopsticks across it, heads into the kitchen, and scrabbles around till he finds two matches, which he holds out, inviting her to snap one of them in two. “The long one represents long life,” he says. “Whoever gets the short match will depart first, and the other person must give them a good burial.”

Granny Liu stares at his hand.

He rolls the matches around in his fist, allowing the dark red matchheads to protrude. He extends them toward his wife. “Ladies first.” She studies them for a second and quickly reaches out for one. Her face falls: it’s long.

“Again,” she says. “Best two out of three.”

Grandpa Liu nods magnanimously and takes the match back, rattles both matches in his fist, and holds out two matchheads again. Now she takes her time, twisting his hand this way and that. She reaches for the left one, hesitates, opts for the right one instead.

A long one again.

“The heavens want me to go first, and they want you to stay behind to give me a good burial.” Grandpa Liu has a smile on his face as he crushes the remaining match and tosses it away. Back to gobbling his food and gulping his drink. The glee on his face makes him look years, even decades, younger.

Granny Liu says nothing. She drew the long match twice, what choice does she have? She’ll give him the perfect funeral, then be left all alone on this earth. You can’t resist your fate, just like those kids who walked eastward and westward, never to return in this lifetime. Grandpa Liu’s chewing and swallowing are as loud as a victory roar. She nibbles and watches as he finishes his food and an entire half jin of liquor. When the platters are empty, he wipes his hand roughly across his mouth, heads back to the pit, and starts digging again.

To the crunch and clank of his spade, Granny Liu finishes her meal. As she carries their dishes to the kitchen, she notices the crushed match by Grandpa Liu’s stool. She picks it up and finds its two halves are connected by a tiny wooden splinter. She pushes them together and places the matchstick on the table next to the other one, side by side like a couple in bed. She scours the ground, finds two more half matches, and bursts out laughing like the sun sidling out after a shower. So he had three matches in his hand. That’s how she could break one in half and he could still hold two long ones out to her.

Beaming, she allows herself to sit a moment longer before heading to the courtyard. Soil is being tossed from the pit, filling the air with the fresh aroma of earth, the scent of crushed tomatoes, the sharp reek of beanstalks. She settles onto a mound of dirt. The grave is now deep enough to contain Grandpa Liu’s entire body. Shirtless, he digs, his scrawny frame filled out by a coating of soil.

She watches him.

He notices her watching him.

“Get a basket and help me clear away the soil,” he says.

“Come up for a minute.”

“What for?”

“Just come up.” 

Grandpa Liu climbs out of the pit. He glances at the sun, bright and piercing. His wife stands up from the pile of earth and walks over, hands clenched. His turn to guess, she says. One fist holds a pebble. If he finds it, he’ll go on living, no regrets. Whoever stays behind must do the bidding of the departed. The first to go will leave funeral instructions that the other must carry out to the letter.

“Just one guess?” asks Grandpa Liu.

She nods firmly.

He stares at her hands, then at her body, her face. She isn’t a full century old, just ninety-nine. Her hair is going patchily gray and she doesn’t have as many wrinkles as he does, as if she were a dozen years younger than him and not just one.

“Go on, guess,” she urges. “Which hand?”

“If I get it right, I have to stay alive?”

She nods.

“Best out of three or one and done?” 

“Once and that’s it,” she says. “No regrets for ten thousand years.” Again she explains the rules: if he guesses correctly, he’ll stay alive and tend to her death. He stares at her face, at the two withered fists before him. How smooth and shiny these hands once were, like unripe apples when clenched. They’ll never be that smooth again. Now they’re clods of wind-dried dirt. He presses on her fingers and shakes her fists. He detects something in her right hand, so he points at her left. “That one.” 

Smiling, she opens her left hand to reveal a pebble. “You found it! I’ll die first. You’ll stay behind and do as I say. Make that grave completely square, nice and large. Facing north-south to get the sun. Stone walls that won’t crumble in a thousand years.” She leans over the pit, pretending to peer in, but before she can quietly ditch the other pebble, Grandpa Liu pounces and prizes her right hand open. 

“You cheat!” he says, disgusted. 

“You held out two long matches.” 

That shuts him up.

He is silent for a very long time, perfectly still, glaring at her. Finally he huffs, “I’ve never lost to anyone in my life. No one has ever dared tell me I’m wrong.” Without warning, he wraps his arms around his wife, lifts her off the ground, and trots toward the house. Smacking his chest, she yells, “What are you doing? Stop it!” Already they’ve gone from graveside to courtyard, his urgent footsteps like the blows of a hammer. She understands what he’s up to and smacks her fists against his shoulders. “We’re a hundred years old! A hundred!”

Her voice glides across the courtyard and rises into the sky, like wild geese heading south for the winter. 




The tomb is ready. They’d expected it to take a month at their age but got the job done in just a couple of weeks, Grandpa Liu digging down below, Granny Liu standing above, hauling away the soil in a willow basket. She can’t lift a full basket, so he sends up half  loads. As she raises the final basket of loose soil and tosses it away, the setting sun blazes, pouring its glow across the courtyard and illuminating the grave so brightly you’d think dawn was rising up out of it.

The grave is nearly ten feet deep. At the bottom they’ve put in a little door leading to a burial chamber tall enough to stand up in, unlike the usual ones, which can be entered only at a crouch. Every inch of wall has been tamped smooth with a shovel, as if a carpenter had lined the tomb with pine panels. A layer of loose dirt covers the ground, soft and springy as a carpet. Anyone walking in barefoot would feel a fresh earthy scent rising into their body through the pores in their feet, like a breeze against their soles at the height of summer, cooling their fervid blood in an instant. Utter refreshment, like a couple dousing themselves with a basin of cold water after doing the pleasurable deed.

The next day, they prop a ladder against the side of the grave and lower two doors and two benches inside, out of which they fashion a makeshift bed in the burial chamber. Next are a stool and a small table, on which they lay out a spread: various meats, cellophane noodles, roast chicken, pig’s head, sliced beef. A few bottles of liquor and some cups, chopsticks, and plates, and, in case they’re needed, incense and an incense burner, and a radio to play opera. Also a dozen lighters, several sets of playing cards, and a Go set with glass pieces. Finally, they open the courtyard gate and listen to the cacophony coming from the street outside, the bustling crowds, the cars and motorcycles outside their neighbors’ homes. Granny Liu closes the gate again and bars it from the inside.

They lock up the house.

Grandpa Liu stands on the ladder down in the grave. “Look around, make sure everything’s in order.”

“Done,” Granny Liu says. “Everything is exactly as it should be.”

She walks toward the tomb in what used to be their vegetable patch. Grandpa Liu supports her legs as she lowers herself in. They stand at the entrance to the burial chamber, next to the table with its banquet, so abundant you’d have thought it was an emperor’s birthday. On a stool in the corner are an oil lamp and candles, which stand up better to the damp air. On the bed is what’s known as “straw bedding,” dried wheat stalks not usually used for the dead, a new reed mat atop them. On the left side of the mat is a painting that Grandpa Liu commissioned: the earth spread flat, hills and rivers and gorges all on one plane, soaring mountains and vast oceans at the same level. On the other side is a white blanket with the image of a strapping young man. Grandpa Liu and Granny Liu stoop to pass through the doorway. The burial chamber looks like paradise, as if everything the world ought to have were right here in this room. He gets in on the left side and lies on the flat earth, while she settles onto her young stud. Each has their own pillow. They hold hands and wait for the screaming heat of midsummer to dwindle. Grandpa Liu looks up at the vaulted red-brown roof and murmurs, “Cool enough?”

“Yes,” she says.

“Happy?”

“Uh-huh.”

“Let’s close our eyes.”

They close them.

“What do you see?” says Grandpa Liu.

“A tall, handsome young man walking toward me. He’s coming closer. His smile!”

“How old are you now?”

“Forties, I think.”

“And now?”

“Twenties. You?”

“I’m a young man. I want to walk to the edge of the world, explore its farthest reaches. I need to see for myself that this planet isn’t round. What shape is it? Rectangular, square, triangular. Maybe something irregular, like an enormous leaf. From an elm or pagoda tree? A paulownia?”

Grandpa Liu clasps his wife’s hand tight, and she squeezes his in return.

“Off you go,” she says. “Come back soon.”

“Take good care of yourself,” he says. “Don’t let that handsome bastard bully you.”

Their hands slowly drift apart. They lie in their tomb, perfectly still. Their breath in the burial chamber feels like candlelight hitting a wall. Something falls from the little table with a crash as loud as incense ash crumbling in the censer. Out of nowhere, someone starts banging at the courtyard gate, yelling for Grandpa Liu to open up quick; he needs to borrow something, come on, open up, it’ll take just a moment.

Grandpa Liu and Granny Liu lie with their eyes shut, listening to the racket as it seeps into the burial chamber. At exactly the same moment, they turn to each other and whisper, “Shhhhh!”

    "text": "I felt my life flick by at 2x speed. I used to be able to take my time eating the cheese out of a big sandwich or wandering the public library, watching kids peel the cardboard spines off Berenstain Bears books and mutilate them with marker. It wasn’t long ago that I spent hours sulking because I missed Joaquin, that I somehow always ended up at a Pret A Manger in Midtown, staring at more sandwiches⁠—⁠cage-free mayo, mature cheddar. Then I’d check and it would only be Tuesday. Now it was always Saturday again and I always had to go to my job at the vintage glasses store.

You would think it might be a good thing, it always being the weekend.

On Saturdays in the East Village people stepped out in clusters, clad in their best jeans, chattering about their weeks. The store I worked at was called Marvelous Martha’s⁠—⁠“Meet your marvelous” was our slogan⁠—⁠and was popular for deadstock fifties cat eyes, interesting designer stuff, and because there was viral gnocchi next door. It came glommed in a Chinese takeout box and cost thirty dollars. People took turns filming cheese pulls with chopsticks. Teenagers stumbled in smelling like truffle sauce. We’d get a curious couple or two dead set on buying nothing, but trying on everything: We’re looking for something square and Kelly green. Do you have anything green? People came in confused and high and screaming, but, most importantly, came the girls, our most loyal customers, the lines of girls in camel coats, fresh off  bottomless brunch, lightly tipsy, pushing in through the front door, a halo of daylight and strawberry vape smoke around them.

So wacky, one girl would say to another, pointing at some sixties squares with an abalone beetle appliqué. Wait, a third would announce. She’d slip on a delicate gold pair with little Versace coins embedded in each temple, and she’d look around, hands outstretched like she was wearing IMAX 3-D glasses, like she was blind. Maddie, do you like these?

Maddie would emerge from the back of the store⁠—⁠she’d be the one with the most intricate hair highlights, a bronde with the most depth. She had the 250 cc moderate-profile implants under the muscle, taut, unclockable. She’d tilt her head and look Lauren in the face, and Lauren would look back, unflinching. Then Maddie would tap her lightly on each shoulder and say:

They kind of make your face look round.

The girls would nod solemnly in agreement, Lauren too. Lauren would be resigned to her round face, and though I’d personally call it more heart-shaped, she wouldn’t want my opinion. People like her preferred it this way. That shape had dictated her place in the world and it’d be difficult to imagine anything different.

Lauren would look into our cheval glass and jab at her cheekbones.

Every now and then, someone seemed to know what they needed.

Sorry, could I please try on those? a girl asked today. If that’s okay? Overly polite, her mouth small and tight like a cat’s, her hair loose blond curls.

Yes, sure.

She pointed to the locked glass cabinet with the designers⁠—⁠Gucci, Fendi, Vivienne Westwood. Mostly metal, shimmering under striplights. I twisted my key in the latch. The Gaultier suns, vintage nineties, gunmetal, rare. They had weird eyeholes, like rectangles with a half-moon chunk cut out of each side, the lenses purple-tinted. What made them most special was that the temples were shaped like Eiffel Towers, with lattice detailing, the very tops of the towers curling over the ears.

She put them on and instantly they looked excellent. Head width was most important when it came to glasses, it was like shoe size. Then came all the other stuff, brow placement and complexion-matching, the choice between angular and soft-edged.

In the back, Josh was trying to sell something clunky and metallic, like a car part, for six hundred dollars. We didn’t earn commissions. Josh did it for the love of the game.

This girl slid them off and glanced at the price. Two hundred and fifty dollars.

She smiled, gave them back. Thanks.

Those look great on you.

Thanks, she said again. I really like them.

Her boyfriend, I realized, was standing right behind me. He stood like a boyfriend, hands pocketed, a little too nonchalant, like this was his living room.

Do you like them? she pressed him.

He wobbled his head in a way that could have meant absolutely anything. Everyone was always parading around their boyfriend who was dressed in ill-fitting athletic shorts and not realizing how important this was for her. It was so obvious when someone found the right thing, that confluence of someone’s grandma auctioning off  her progressives on eBay in Lithuania and a person’s ears being the ideal distance apart. It meant something, for a frame to fit, and for the person to feel good in it.

I’ll come back for them, she said firmly. After the next paycheck. I need them for a wedding. My best friend’s wedding.

Well, they’re a good choice. And a good price, given how much they sometimes go for online. I don’t make a commission, I added. So I’m telling the truth.

I hope it works out.

Me too.

She smiled. Thanks.

I heard Josh close the deal back there. From afar, he winked.

I was in love with Josh. When he was a teenager, he’d run away from a rural town called Misty Wagon, after his pastor dad found out he’d paid for a girl’s abortion. I’d felt so jealous when he described that girl⁠—⁠she’d had heterochromia, one green eye and one brown. Josh and I had sex one time at the staff Christmas party, thrown by Jeff, the owner of Marvelous Martha’s, and then never again. There was no Martha. Jeff was a retail mogul, and once a year he let us choose one optical and one sun to keep, then bought out a rooftop bar⁠—⁠bottle girls, aerial silks, henna tattoos⁠—⁠and everyone got obliterated. Seventeen negronis. I’d gotten a lotus mandala inked cold and wet on the back of my wrist by a lady in a sequined fedora. Later, under flashing blue rave lights, Josh had leaned over and picked off each bit of dried dye, revealing a warm, orangey shape.

Josh rang up his client, who doled out six hundred dollars in cash. They were deep in conversation about subway fares. Her eyes glowed. He was that type of guy, I was so unoriginal. But the crush felt visceral, it slipped out from my body and steered me in ways I couldn’t control. I stared at his left earlobe, at the lift of his shirt revealing one strip of stomach skin as he reached up to grab a clamshell case from the shelf. I ogled him. It was humiliating.

Today there was a sticky note on the register that explained that hand-delivery was required for a pair purchased online by a woman who lived around the corner. It was rare that we made house calls, but it happened.

Where’d those 1997 Gaultiers go? I asked Josh.

He stood leaning against the glass case, texting. Which?

They were the silver ovals with curly temples like telephone cords, titanium, with bulbous lenses that shone like mirrors, so when you looked into someone’s eyes, you saw your own face, fish-eyed.

Telephone cords, I said.

Telephone cords, he said. Telephone. Cords. He was texting.

Eight hundred dollars.

Oh. I sold those yesterday, he said, proud.

I held up the note. It says someone paid for them on Thursday and they have to be hand-delivered.

What? He snatched the note from me. He stared at it. Jeff is gonna kill me. Wait a minute. Bonnie Yaeger?

Yeah.

Ha. That’s that junkie, he said, relieved. He had a naturally wide mouth when he laughed, and kind of looked like Ashton Kutcher, though he was half-Korean and less spacey. Josh would spend an hour on slow days intently tightening the hinge screws on each of the seventies aviators and listening to me talk about New French Extremity or something else that sounded like just a vague collection of words. I had a lot of ideas, including one for a script based on my mom’s odd stint transcribing wiretaps for the DEA in LA in the early nineties. I hadn’t been able to finish it, due to the feeling that nobody cared. That sounds awesome, Josh had said. Within a week I wrote my final twenty pages.

She’s a millionaire and a junkie, he repeated, saying “junkie” like it was either obscene or scalding, like it hurt his mouth and he had to get it out quick. He could be cruel. It would end my life, for him to be cruel to me like that. She won’t remember what we sold her, he said.

So, what should I do?

He smiled. Just offer her all the other Gaultiers.

Gently, we removed them from their shelf and set them in their branded cases. A pair like goggles, made of glittering purple acetate, a pair of silver wraps, three wires for the temples that intertwined behind the ear. I liked the Gaultiers⁠—⁠they were inventive, indulgent, they enjoyed being complicated. They made no sense, some of them, they were funny ideas brought to fruition. It felt celebratory, to wear a Gaultier, like you were proud and didn’t mind the extra attention it would garner.

Really present them to her. Lay them out real nice. He sighed, standing slightly behind me, one hand flat on the counter, his voice low near my ear. If it doesn’t work, my neck is really on the line. Eight hundred dollars is a lot of money.

Don’t worry, I said, my pulse quick. It’s gonna be okay. I’ll handle it.




I walked down the street toward East Fifth, where said junkie resided, past the new home goods boutique, swarming with young professionals, everybody’s day off. I watched through the scalloped Venetian archway as a couple groped stuff. They caressed a heart-shaped Dutch oven and whispered to each other, then moved on and rubbed the sides of a pink enamel brisket braiser, up and down with their hands, up and down. I walked past where Joaquin used to live, an inexplicably mustard yellow building. I figured he’d moved, he’d hated that building, though he wasn’t really a self-starter. He was the type to let things happen to him. He’d once gone to a Puerto Rican barber who’d misunderstood his instructions and carved an intricate swoop design into the side of his head, and he’d kept it for a week, for fun, as a joke. I thought you’d be the one to initiate this, he’d said sadly, dumping me in front of our friend’s duplex in Astoria.

I turned off First Avenue and onto East Fifth and saw the apartment building, its facade a smooth slate gray, like it had just been erected. There were ten narrow front steps at a steep angle, the handrail a black steel bar that shot diagonally down from the top, then bent to a sharp right angle and pierced the concrete.

Excuse me, I said to two people seated in the center of the steps. They scooted apart. They looked like college kids, slouchy, their clothes lopsided, and they were talking intensely about something serious. It looked like they might be midbreakup. Then I realized it was the same couple from the store, the girl with the curly blond hair and her boyfriend, seated with his legs spread wide, with crisp white socks and sneakers bright in the sun.

I gave her a tight half smile as I stepped over her shoulder. I stumbled a little on the lip of one step and brushed her arm. Sorry, I said.

Don’t be, she said, then scoffed. She looked at him and muttered, You’re the one who pushed me down the stairs.

I wasn’t sure I’d heard that correctly. Pushed?

I was already inside the lobby. I had my headphones in. You don’t have to stop for everybody. You didn’t have to hear it. But I had heard it. That was what she’d said, wasn’t it? I repeated it in my head.

The lobby was stark and echoey, like an empty bank vault, like a big locker, the units all out of order⁠—⁠no. 2 upstairs, no. 3 on the ground floor. I stalked up to the second floor and knocked.

The woman answered, with Manic Panic–orange hair. Her massive white dog, a Samoyed, rose to its hind legs and attacked my thigh, its paws dip-dyed pink.

Hi! Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry. He’s so crazy. Ha.

Hi, Bonnie?

She pulled him backward by the collar. He yelped. Come on in, she said, turning. Dark purple cupping marks on her back peeked out from her tank top.

I stepped into her apartment, all high white loft ceilings and huge windows trapping the mid-May heat. There were hanging planters filled with hibiscus and ivy, their tendrils spread flat along the walls and trickling limply over the long white dining room table. Fruit-fly-catcher tape, speckled all over. Blankness besides that. It was the kind of space designed for hosting soirees, but they’d fumbled the lighting⁠—⁠it felt fluorescent, like a 7-Eleven.

Okay, so I only have fifty-five on me right now. I paid John five extra last time. If I buy again tomorrow, would it be okay to give you the rest then?

I blinked at her. John? I’m sorry. I’m here from Marvelous Martha’s. We gave you a call reminder prior that I was going to come by with your pair of glasses that you ordered online. You requested delivery.

A crease formed between her brows.

So, can I show you? I said.

I’m sorry, you’re with who?

You purchased some glasses for home delivery. Sunglasses.

Oh! Oh, oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Thank you. Oh my gosh I love you guys. I love it there. So marvelous.

She sat and watched as I did what Josh told me to do⁠—⁠set the bag down, spread them out in a row. I noticed a spoon on the table. She inched it toward the edge.

So, I began. You purchased these. I pointed to the Eiffel Towers.

She nodded like this was the truth, squinting at them.

But I just thought, might as well bring all the Gaultiers over and show you other options too.

I waited. She pocketed the spoon and leaned forward, staring at the frames. They gleamed beneath the minimalist industrial chandelier, austere above us.

I didn’t buy those, she said.

Sorry?

Any of those. I bought those curly-temple ones. The Gaultiers. I remember. She rocked back, then forward, and folded her arms, out of a seeming need to do something, anything, with her body, to wad it up into a more compact shape. She crossed her legs, pretzeled one ankle around the other, held her knuckles to her chin.

Oh. Are you sure? I said.

Yeah. Yeah, they were really cool. Yeah. They had sides like this. She made a rapid twirling motion with her finger.

There was no use in lying. Come clean. You can salvage this. Josh.

I know exactly which ones you mean, I explained. I believe we may have gotten our wires crossed between our online orders and our purchases in-store. That pair has unfortunately sold. I’m so sorry. We can offer you one of these pairs instead.

Hmm. She nodded, slowly. You want some wine or something?

I glanced at the clock: 5:30 p.m. End of the day. Go with the flow, I thought. Go with her flow. The customer is king, Jeff’s Thai wife was always calling the store to remind us.

Um, okay, sure.

She found an old-seeming bottle of Malbec on a sculptural rack in the corner of the room that was patinaed to look weathered and involved a lot of elaborate, mashed-up metal, like a Saw trap. She poured me a glass, poured herself some in a mug that said FUCK ART LET’S DANCE. She drank, her mouth stained with red silt. I saw, then, on the ground, several other, empty bottles.

Thanks, I said, and took a sip.

You know what, she said, raising one pointer finger. That’s actually okay, then. I can totally take a look at some other ones.

I watched her.

I’ll just choose something else!

Okay! Great!

I knew that crack was purer than normal cocaine, the high stronger and somehow more perfect, that, against stereotypes, rich people sometimes did it for that reason. In a Kate Moss kind of way, though there was nothing glamorous about Bonnie, seemingly unshowered. Maybe her dad had invented lab-grown Wagyu or some kind of integral innovation in air travel. She was all alone with her dumb purebred dog, who was butting his head into the back of the couch now, then backing up and doing it again. I felt sad then, watching her, the table vibrating. She was shaking her left knee hard beneath it.

The dog lapped up something I didn’t want to look at off the hardwood floor.

She took the Eiffel Towers and shove them onto her face, the temples like tweezers. They didn’t fit. Head too wide. She took out her phone, fixed her hair, and looked into her front camera. Her dog barked hoarsely, like she was a stranger. She turned and caught his paws. Who’s a good boy. His fur shook loose and I sneezed.

Those are awesome, I said, rubbing my nose.

Aren’t they? she said. What’s the price on these?

Those actually cost significantly less. I can refund you partial.

You know what. I just don’t think so, she said.

I nodded. The ball was in her court, I understood. The whole game was.

I feel like these are actually kind of ugly. She looked at them in her hands. The ugliness is what I don’t like. I just don’t wear stuff like this. I’m always buying stuff I won’t wear. I really need something for this film premiere and I wanted something fun and interesting. But this is not right. The ugliness.

She said “ugliness” like it was pervasive, like it was staining the whole room.

I looked down at what she was wearing. Just comfortable, nondescript loungewear, billowing black pants flecked with fur.

Maybe you’d like to take a look at our selection in-store?

She slid the Eiffel Towers over the dog’s face. The dog looked, now, like Elton John.

Maybe I’ll just come in sometime and use store credit? she said. Can you give me store credit? Then I can really take my time finding something good. Premiere is in a month.

Okay! Yes, that’s very easy.

This was ideal. Jeff would never notice, and Josh would be fine. I reached over to take the glasses off the dog. They were delicate.

She scratched the back of her head, a little too roughly, the way you do when you’re alone.

I began to pack up the cases. Time to go, I thought, then moved and knocked an ankle into what I saw were stacks and stacks of VHS tapes and DVDs under the table, all kinds of movies. Tropic Thunder. Trouble Every Day. They slid out into a fan shape.

Oh. Cool. Storytelling, I said, pointing to the case for it. Love that movie.

Yeah! Her eyes lit up. Yeah. Yeah, I work in the industry, so, you know. Yeah. She made a silly face as if to indicate, Ah, I’m so busy! And she seemed intent on talking to me about it. I have this really awesome setup, with the TV.

Awesome.

Please have a seat. Let me show you.

She wanted store credit. It was almost over. I didn’t want to fuck up in the final stretch. So I sat on her massive cream-toned couch, the kind of suede I’d liked to draw hearts in as a kid.

She sat next to me and pressed a button. The TV made a disconcerting drone. Then, slowly, it began to invert, to flip and disappear neatly into a divot in the wall, revealing an even larger wide-screen TV behind it, half the wall’s size.

Cool, I said.

Yeah! So you can watch whatever you want. Storytelling isn’t really my fave. Too disturbing. Rape stuff not my thing. But, you know. Interesting. She laughed a little.

I’d shown Joaquin that movie and he’d hated it too. His family were art collectors, midcentury sculpture, a lot of abstract wooden stuff, everything looked like a pelvis or a deformed bicycle. His dad had been forever skeptical of me, once observing that I didn’t know how to properly shell and eat shrimp.

My ex-boyfriend doesn’t like that movie either, I said. Controversial movie.

Oh! Who’s your ex? she said, like we might know the same people.

Joaquin, I said.

She pressed several buttons all at once. Hulu launched.

I felt myself sink inadvertently deeper into the soft suede couch. Though Joaquin hadn’t cared about movies or my writing, I missed how he’d catered to something intrinsic in me. I liked when we’d gotten so hungover it felt like our veins were throbbing, and we lay in his California-king bed all day watching sparrows hatch in the nest outside his window. I missed when he’d sit next to me on the couch, when he’d take the fleshy part of my hand near the thumb and knead it, then crack the joint. Comfort like when the moon is out a little bit early, like it was now, outside this woman’s window, or like someone else’s mom making you a sandwich without asking. A comfort you didn’t have to earn, that was always there.

She launched the Pandora app. Fuck, she said. So, your ex. What did he do?

He didn’t believe in me.

I meant for work.

Oh. Gallery assistant.

Boring.

The dog barked at the two TVs.

You miss him? she said, though not really as a question, it was like she could tell I did. She gave up on the TV, whatever she’d been trying to do with the TV, and curled her legs up, set her head in her hand, facing me.

Yeah, I said. I thought of Josh now, of sitting close to Josh on a couch, of Josh cracking my joint like that. Josh would know how to talk to this lady, he’d be down the block by now.

It’s all right. To miss, she said, very seriously. I miss, all the time. All the time. Especially my ex. And my daughter.

We both went silent. She was probably somewhere in her early thirties but the creases between her eyes had become permanent, I could see them in the process of becoming permanent, she was forming the crumpled, wincing face that made them permanent. Her eyes were shot through with red veins.

I’m sorry, I said.

It’s been a year and a half, she said. Is how long it’s been. She’s out in Florida. Sarasota. Full custody with him. She’s two. She nodded.

I sat up, all set to leave. I’m so sorry, I said.

Yeah. Her eyes seemed to focus, to settle on my face. I mean, you don’t look like much. A lot of pretty girls out there, she said. A lot of pretty girls in New York.

I looked past her, at the blank wall.

Working a storefront like that. Hard on your self-esteem. You’re very particular-looking, in the face.

How else could you look particular, besides in the face? I thought of Lauren looking me up and down as she and her friends filed out of the store.

I know, hard. Hard to find a boy. Her face flooded with sympathy. But you’re young. Somebody someday will see you, and they’ll think, All right. Why not. And you’ll be for that person.

The dog began to throw back up what it had eaten.

And someone just becomes your person because they also need you to decide they’re important. So. She extended two fingers on each hand, like tuning forks, then shot them up into the air and crossed them, as if to imply something spiritual, vibrational. And there you go.

I thought of Joaquin chatting for a little too long with a college girl as she steamed his dirty chai. Josh’s way of looking past me in the store, at Maddie.

You got something else besides glasses going for you? Or what? Is that all? Her face puckered into something sour. Against her white wall, the black of her pants seemed blacker than black, swallowing light.

I have to get back to work.

Oh. That jolted her. She seemed dazed now, weary.

Feel free to call the store with any questions.

Well, thanks for hanging out.

I left and shut the door, hard.




The East Village was so public I didn’t even think about crying, somebody always passing by dressed up like it was their sixteenth birthday and they were on their way to the Cheesecake Factory, except they were thirty years old.

On the front steps, the girl was still there with the guy, though now he leaned away and stared out between the thin slats of the railing, and she cried quietly into the palms of her hands.

I stopped at the base of the steps. Do you guys live here?

They both looked at me like they weren’t surprised at all that I had asked that, then shook their heads in unison.

Are you with him?

She nodded.

Where do you live?

Off the F.

I’m walking to that train, I said. Do you want to walk with me?

He still didn’t seem surprised, nor did he look like the type to push a girl down the stairs. He had a narrow frame. His forehead had turned lightly pink from sitting out in the sun and he seemed dejected. He had the sullen jowls of a person who didn’t smile much, who plodded along the same way forever with no way out, with a sensible buzz cut. I imagined him pushing her, the picture of his violence setting in, its simplicity unnerving. I didn’t know if she’d meant down these stairs, or others, or how far the fall had been. From the top of these it was a long plummet down to concrete.

Come, I said.

She stood without saying anything to him, then walked silently by my side to the end of the block.

He must think I’m fucking stupid, she said.

He’s always saying condescending, stupid bullshit, she said.

I’m a fucking ballet dancer. What the fuck right does he have? He could’ve fucked up my knee. He doesn’t fucking care that I have a fucking audition tomorrow. I’m fucking trying and what the fuck has he ever done? He sits in rooms all day and doesn’t do anything. The other day he told me he’d never tried fruit before. Like, apples. Who the fuck has never had fruit?

We passed the Rite Aid, all boarded up. All the Rite Aids kept closing and there were fewer places to go for pain relief, for Robitussin or tampons without a cardboard applicator. I thought of the cardboard applicator, dry-hot, chafing on its way up. That was the feeling, I thought, of being absolutely fucked over.

He hates me.

Maybe, I said.

This silenced her.

I don’t want to be a loser like him, she said.

You’re not.

She said nothing.

Trying makes you not a loser.

She nodded quickly, her lip quivering. We walked onward.

Seven men in polo shirts marched toward a taqueria. One shouldered past us.

You don’t need him. For anything. He won’t help you, I said. You don’t need him.

The sky was pale blue, the clouds thin and pulled apart. A delivery guy on an e-bike pounded past and barely missed my nose. We made it to the train.

I’m not actually getting on the train, I said. I have to get back to my job.

Oh. She understood. Thanks.

Did he really push you?

She looked away. Yeah. Not hard, she said. But he did. She stood like a ballet dancer, her feet turned outward, a silver barrette lost somewhere in her bed of curls, her face flushed like she was a kid who’d played outside too long. She had a muddled, distant look, not just disappointment but disbelief at how much disappointment.

So maybe you break up with him.

She nodded, her eyes reddish and swollen.

You’re going to a wedding?

My best friend. In Jersey. The theme is Gothic romance.

Take these.

She took the branded case, embedded with silvery thread. She opened it, looked inside. Her face changed, seeing them. She cradled them, feeling their weight.

Oh, no. I can’t.

Just take them.

She shut the case. How much?

Nothing. It doesn’t matter.

I could bring them back.

Don’t.

After the wedding. I could.

Josh, I thought, was on the line.

They’re yours.

She clasped the case closed in her hands, looked down at it, and nodded, and then, smart of her, like I might change my mind, turned and hustled down the steps to the F.




By the time I got back to the store, Josh had already lowered the guard gate halfway to deter any more customers and sat at the register, counting cash.

What’s up?

She took the Eiffel Towers, I said. I told her I’d process a partial store credit. She didn’t seem to care either way.

Yeah, well, she’s an addict, he said. She’s a loser who lives on her dad’s money. Fuck her.

Josh could be so biting, so decisive when assessing a person’s worth. I never felt sure what I thought about people. Assessing my script draft, he’d said he really liked when the girl talked about the moon at the end, the n blunted on his tongue, dragging out the resonant word moon like he enjoyed the sound of his own voice, the sound of his own approval. I’d wanted to burrow myself in his approval. I didn’t understand how there wasn’t enough to usher us into love. I didn’t understand where else I’d find it.

She was freebasing crack cocaine, I said.

In front of you?

No, but it was obvious.

Hmm. He laughed a little, contemplating. Crazy. His phone lit up on the glass counter. One text. Then four. Then seven.

She said she had a daughter.

Thanks for handling this. Today. He texted some more. Cool of you.

No problem. I lingered, sweeping up dust. I watched as he texted for ten more minutes, chuckled to himself. Then he packed his bag, clocked out. I finished closing, set the alarm.

What are you up to tonight? he said. You want to get a drink? Happy-hour margaritas.

I saw the night flick past, and me in his bed afterward while he lit some kind of citrus strain of weed, went nonverbal, slept. Me, swaddled in his sweater, meandering home with matted hair and dried-out contact lenses at 4:45 A.M., rehearsing how exactly I’d give the sweater back at work⁠—⁠I had fun, that was so cool.

The outside air wafted in through the open door.

Maybe another night?

Sure, he said.

I knew it wouldn’t ever be another night. It was always Saturday.

Josh locked up.

Let me know later. If you change your mind.

Okay. Maybe.

I walked away, past two teenage girls who’d been in the store earlier. They were seated on a bench outside the gnocchi place, one inches from the other’s ear, their knees touching. She whispered something. The other gasped, then broke out into a cackle, a seismic laugh, her body shaking, too small to contain it. I remembered when things were the funniest fucking things ever. She fell into the other’s lap, the whole heap of her.

They stretched their legs out, enough room for them now that the crowds had dispersed, now that they had the whole span of pavement. One reached down for her box of gnocchi, the little potato nubs ribbed like larvae, the parmesan cold and hard. She deserved it, she’d spent her entire allowance on it. She didn’t know any better. She took a big, happy bite."

    "text": "If someone put a gun to my head and said, When was the beginning of the end, I would have to say: my mother-in-law’s funeral in 1983. That moment when, standing over the coffin, looking down at Blanchie (two hundred pounds in the flush of life, now a prune reposing on satin), I realized suddenly and without a shadow of a doubt that I could not allow my daughter to win our weeklong argument regarding the movie Flashdance.

Not technically a lesbian film, but who are we kidding. 

And boy did I try to kid myself. Why on earth would an eleven-year-old girl beg with such abject passion to see Flashdance, I had been asking no one, or God. The question had been keeping me up at night. As if I didn’t know. I did know. I knew enough to say, on instinct, no Flashdance. Over my dead body would I be taking her to this film. I told her it was age-inappropriate. To which she pointed out that I had dragged her to see Saturday Night Fever, a surprisingly violent movie about disco dancers, at age six. My daughter had watched wide-eyed, immobilized with terror in that chilly budget theater on Eighty-Fifth and First. Well. We ate cheeseburgers afterward, on English muffins at an Irish pub. My way of apologizing. It’s all gone now, that theater, that bar. But the point is, I had a ball that day. The dancing, the Bee Gees. A ball. As long as I didn’t have to look over at my child trembling in her seat. For this I’m sure I could be forgiven. My other sins not so much. But I needed to see John Travolta, and if I had to schlep my daughter to this movie so help me God, I would. About Flashdance, however, I was not to be moved. The more my daughter pleaded and howled, the more firm was I in my resolution. Thou shalt not see Flashdance, not on my watch. 

There was something very wrong in her level of desperation. In the history of knowing my daughter, no movie had evoked such histrionics. This was a girl who didn’t give a shit about dance. In fact, she had at one point been suspended from school for refusing to participate in ballet, and now the sudden interest? The pouting, the pleading, all to watch a movie about⁠—well, when I thought about it, when I really faced the truth⁠—this was a movie about women in Pittsburgh who took off their clothes. 

For whatever reason, looking at Blanchie in her burial outfit was when it all hit me. The specter that had haunted me throughout my married life: distant, for-no-good-reason-haughty Blanchie, now a shrivel in a blue dress. I realized then and there that all my dreams had died.

In case it seems like I am the kind of person who likes to get a good gander at dead people, I would rather not have had anything to do with Blanchie’s body, but I was in the process of being silently, unjustly accused of having tampered with the contents of the casket. Specifically, a photograph had gone missing, one that was meant to be buried with Blanchie. And I knew, from the way Stephen’s brother Saul was glaring, that suspicion had fallen on me.

Meanwhile, Saul⁠—this glarer, this accuser, this absolute zhlob⁠—had the brilliant idea of bringing a cheese-and-cold-cut platter to an open-casket ceremony. In that moment it was impossible not to feel enraged at men and their self-satisfied blundering through the world. It was very Saul to enrobe a funeral in the stench of deli meat. Nothing was sacred. Even the reverence for death had to be pickled in mundanity. I marched to the window and cracked it open, trying to make the point that never in the history of open-casket funerals had one been so acutely salami-scented.

Saul, however, was deep in an inquisition of the funeral home director, who insisted that the casket had remained untouched since it arrived by freight on its flight from Florida two days prior. In fact, no one noticed me airing out the room except for a pair of dogs taking syncopated dumps on Coney Island Avenue. A thread of sooty air leaked in, casting a chill across the shins of my pantyhose. There was something about the combination of this shin-chill with the odors of the street and the cold-cut platter that made me nauseated, and my stomach twisted with that high note that lets you know that queasiness is a prelude to actual vomiting.

I would have liked to blame Stephen for everything, but I couldn’t. The truth was that I had bound myself to this man and his cold-cut-bringing family decades prior, and from thence came all the rest of it. Including giving birth to a daughter, who, it turned out, not only wanted to see women take off their clothes but wanted also to be a man. Hadn’t I done my best, trying to keep her away from the corduroy blazer she was constantly digging out from the depths of Stephen’s closet?

In fact, just that day I had conducted one such enterprise⁠—not so easy, by the way, in a shoebox apartment. Three rooms that opened onto each other, like a flower with the majority of its petals plucked. One might think it would be impossible to conduct clandestine operations in such a small space, but I had a way of imagining myself as Ilona Massey on Top Secret, alert in a silk slip dress, forever waiting to poison a Nazi with a doctored glass of bourbon.

Sitting in the living-room-cum-den-cum-dining-area, I could perceive each individual noise of our abode without turning my head. If I sat long enough, still enough, I would sort of expand and become the apartment. I was a map made solely of family sounds⁠—the rustle of Stephen turning newspaper pages in the bathroom, the irregular blasts of sitcom laughter from behind my daughter’s bedroom door.

When I was assured that everyone was otherwise occupied, I slipped over to the shallow little nook next to the entryway, a.k.a. “the hall closet,” a ridiculously tiny cost-shaving compromise common to that whole swath of apartments that had sprouted from Fifty-Ninth to Eighty-Ninth Streets, east of Third Avenue, after the war. 

Each week it seemed another friend from the old neighborhood was installing themselves in one of these apartments nearby. You’d go across the street for a game of gin rummy and⁠—boop!⁠—find yourself cramming your overcoat into the same little void you crammed it into at home. At the time it felt kind of comforting, like a Catskills bungalow colony or a college dormitory. Not that I had ever lived in a dormitory.

As time passed, though, I started to dwell. Who were these WASP engineers who had deemed such minuscule containers suitable for us? From whence came their sadistic agreement that the Jews of Yorkville should have only tiny little pockets in which to hang an entire family’s coats? Jews should be happy to even have an apartment in Manhattan and not be dead in a ditch in Europe, I guess.

However, just that day as I heaved open the humidity-soaked door from its suture to the jamb, I indulged a hope based precisely in the losing proposition of this closet and what it represented about the slumminess of our lives. In the smallness of this nook lay its promise: the genuine sequestration of the corduroy blazer.

And Stephen’s sport coats did constitute a kind of fortress, packed to the point of being practically grouted into that miniature span of wall-void. They made a forbidding barrier, which I shouldered aside as I frothed up the scent of my husband into the microenvironment of the closet. A trench coat exuded Stephen’s musk: peppermint Life Savers, pipe tobacco, old rain. I sucked it all in like the dregs of a Camel Light.

With barely an inch to move, I hunted and shoved and shouldered until I came to the corduroy blazer. Wrenching its hanger neck from the millipede of other necks I removed the jacket from its position and then launched myself through the small opening I had momentarily managed to pierce in the citadel of blazers, javelining the corduroy one behind the row and catching it on the belt hook along the back wall. I pushed the closet door closed, raking up dust from the wall-to-wall pink pile carpet, then secured it against the paint-shedding jamb with a bump of my hip and retreated to our bedroom, where I sat down at my dressing table to prepare my makeup for the day.

Who would believe that this offspring, this golem of upside-down gender, persisted? Not five minutes before we were to leave for Sherman’s did I stumble upon my daughter modeling the sport coat in the full-length mirror on the interior of this very closet door. An elf twisting and turning in a sail of corduroy, pinching the blazer at the small of her back to affect the mirage of tailoring. I cannot communicate the level of despair this scene inspired in me.

“This is why,” I said, under my breath, emerging from behind so that we were both briefly reflected in the mirror⁠—me in my black Anne Klein belted blazer dress with my hair out to here, and her in, well, also sort of a blazer dress if you think about it.

I folded my arms as she turned to face me. I was not technically blocking the way, but once you are a mother you become differently sized, and certain things can’t be helped. I felt my own power radiating off me, something in which you might think I would have reveled but which I never entirely liked, because while on the one hand, as a mother, you do become larger, you also become smaller. I will come back to this point later.

“Why what?” my daughter had the audacity to ask. Methought the blazer was giving her unusual boldness.

“You know what,” I said, arching an eyebrow.

“Everyone else in my class has seen it!” she bleated. But she turned bright red and unblazered herself, throwing the sport coat onto the carpet and darting around me into her room to fetch her sanctioned outfit, a pleated black wool skirt and a black V-neck topped with a burgundy velvet knee-length duffle coat from Gimbels.




It’s strange the way connections get made. I was standing there looking at Blanchie, and I flashed on a vision of my daughter in the corduroy blazer from earlier that day. I grasped then very clearly the enterprise on which she was set⁠—a lifelong enterprise, if she had her way, and one against which I realized I would have to stake my own life. I’m trying to explain something, and it’s hard to know where to start. Karl Marx, or so I have had it endlessly drilled into me by my erstwhile “daughter” (now, indeed, something else entirely; now, moreover, the one holding the proverbial gun to my head and demanding an accounting of things), famously said that beginnings are difficult in all scientific endeavors. Especially, I would like to add, in yenta science. Look, I’m talking about how people (for example, women) become things, and how things (for example, corduroy blazers) become quasipeople, or take on a vitality of their own. This very shitty situation has actually defined both my and my daughter’s lives, as much as we might hate to admit it and, on any given day, have trouble even recognizing this fact.

To make matters worse I had to bear the force of realizing all this while witnessing Stephen’s timidity about what had to be done. Someone was going to have to hunt in the folds of the casket for the photograph. We had conducted all the peering we could conduct. The physical scouring of Blanchie’s body needed to commence. If Stephen wanted to protect my reputation, he would do it. He knew it and I knew it. Yet there he was, bouncing from foot to foot in front of the coffin, hesitating. It seemed like part of a grander refusal on his part to acknowledge facts about the world⁠—his waffling, his hemming, his hawing, his willingness to see both sides about everything. Even things about which there were very clear sides to take. I mean, this was a person who had touched dead bodies before, and yet such dillydallying I never saw.

To be fair, it was probably not so many dead bodies. A deputy executive director (a.k.a. a glorified numbers cruncher in the employ of the public health department) neither touches dead bodies as a matter of course like a real doctor would nor touches a paycheck of any significance. Still, Stephen had indeed touched one or two dead bodies at some point in medical school, back before he had abandoned his goal of becoming a practicing physician. Certainly that should have been enough to acclimate a person to the feel of it, or at least would have made a person more acclimated than was, say, Saul, hulking by the cold-cut plate in a sharkskin suit with shoulder pads so large and, really, ridiculously buoyant that the word pluming would not be inappropriate to describe the overall effect of this jacket.  

No, this was the job for my husband, Stephen Rosenberg, who, in all his experience or lack thereof with dead bodies, was not prepared to be plunging his hands wrist-deep under the buttocks of his dead mother. 

The man needed a nudge. I crossed the room to Stephen’s side at the coffin’s edge. Why do I want to say “shore”? “The coffin’s shore”?

I suppose I have not so nicely always associated Blanchie with whales, and now she was beached, so to speak; but I think it also has to do with my current condition, which some would call high as a kite on OxyContin and others might more generously describe as extremely free-associative. For example, just now as I was narrating this particular memory, my mind sort of skipped and suddenly I was remembering this dream I had the other night: Stephen was alive, and we were on another planet. I guess I was channeling him. Stephen loved the stars, as most men do.

Whereas I have never cared much for outer space. To begin with, I have always hated to fly. Also, there is no shopping in space. Although this may seem a superficial position, consider a thing of which I have been apprised by the left-wing guerrilla/daughter/caretaker/torturer who is, at this very moment, sitting at my dressing table chair imperiously reading a book⁠—a thing called communal luxury. This is an actual perspective of some Marxists, who believe that after the revolution we will all have Chanel bags! Someone should inform science fiction writers about this, because a novel about that I would read. 

Anyway, in my dream I’m standing with Stephen on a cliff above a violet-colored ocean. The shoreline is this glittery dark sand, and where the sea washes over the beach, the sand turns the color of Elizabeth Taylor’s eyes.

I want to say something to Stephen, but when I turn and look for him, he’s gone. Only his briefcase is there, sitting next to me on the cliff, quiet as a turd. And then I remember. Stephen’s dead. When I start wondering if I’m dead too, I wake up.

So I guess that’s where “shore” came from. It’s hard to hold on to time. Now I’m realizing that I wasn’t nauseated that day at Blanchie’s funeral. I must be remembering it that way because I’m very nauseated right now, when it is the year 2011, and the guerrilla has just plunked down at my bedside (soon-to-be deathbed?) some kind of newfangled green shake that I will be unable to so much as sip without my stomach lurching in queasy protest. But at Blanchie’s funeral, in 1983, honestly I think I would have liked to eat from the cold-cut platter. Specifically, a spoonful of chopped liver. I need to add that to my running list for when I start to feel better.

Salted matzo with mustard and a slice of Swiss cheese
A slice of coconut cream pie
Ba-Tampte pickled green tomatoes, sliced on a plate
Chopped liver

So while it is probably true that I really wanted the cold cuts, no way was I going to gratify Saul, the platter-bringing zhlob, by affirming the usefulness of having these pungent meats close at hand. Especially not while the Mystery of the Missing Photo still needed to be solved.

I made my way to the coffin, snack-free, and stood next to Stephen, issuing very specific instructions sotto voce. Sotto voce and yet still somehow enunciating each word with all the precision of a trained actress⁠—a trained actress, let me add, who was supposed to have gone on to grace the marquees of countless New York City thee-ah-tahs instead of starring at the reception desk of Eli Zilch, the (nominally) Upper East Side plastic surgeon (his office was east of Third Avenue, which everyone knows doesn’t count) whose business consisted largely of all-cash payments from the bosses of the Brighton Beach Bratva for the gigantifying of their goomars’ breasts. Or worse⁠—which I would have preferred no one to know, but it’s the truth and what does it matter now⁠—cleaning up the exam rooms after Zilch rammed his lipo spear repeatedly into the flanks of said goomars. Yes, I was the official baller-upper of the grease-stained blue paper upon which the mistresses of the Bratva had sat their asses while being speared. This was my lot in life while my so-called daughter was learning to play Debussy uptown, amongst the children of every single major royal family in exile. It seemed that any time a country’s people rose up against their monarchs, there was a private jet waiting to squire the ousted royals to a triplex on Park Avenue, and the next thing you knew these children were enrolled at the Spence School for Girls with my financially aided own. This is how I came to learn such things as that the royals of  Denmark are not allotted an actual last name beyond “of Denmark” (the roll call for these girls was like being in a film: one of the Vanderbilt children, so-and-so del Drago, Eloise of Denmark …), whereas the Swedish nobility had long names that did not correspond to the word Sweden, and in fact they never spoke of their iced homeland in mixed company, probably out of guilt for their complicity in the Holocaust. Which was ironic, because the direct Nazi heirs wore their own last names so entirely without disguise or shame that those few Jewish mothers whose children had gained entrance to this storied institution and its equally tony brother school became so accustomed to this whole situation that we forgot to watch in amazement as such things as “So, nu, what’s going on with your girl and that nice Globočnik boy?” escaped our mouths like cartoon thought bubbles as we stood around waiting to pick up our children from, if you can believe it, squash practice. 

Honestly, I wouldn’t have cared about the ass-grease paper so much if it weren’t clear that my daughter was not only not going to fulfill her God-given duty of multiplying our family but was well on her way to becoming a permanent embarrassment, a shanda to the max. I would have been happy to give my life and every single workday to balling up ass-grease paper if the fruits of my mothering were going to pay off.

But they were not. I saw that now. I guess what I want to say is that it’s a question of a return on an investment. I don’t mean to be crude, but some things are just true.

“There is no royal road to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits,” my nefarious nurse likes to lord over me, quoting Karl Marx in his French Preface. She loves to say “French Preface.” She loves to extemporize on how difficult it is to analyze the world. She loves, moreover, the illness-induced reversal in our power dynamics, and she loves to sleazily pivot from Marx quotes to a slew of bizarre emotional demands: her care for my penance. “Apologize!” she loves to blurt while changing my bedpan or the sheets. “Apologize dialectically!” she even recently shrieked.

Hear ye, hear ye, I don’t need a French Preface to explain that sometimes you need to slog your way through something in order to really understand it. I have slogged through so much, hello, and yet not a single piece of advice that I have ever given my daughter has she taken.

So yes, I did egg Stephen on in the pursuit of a missing photograph, which I myself had placed in the casket in Boca Raton before Blanchie’s body was flown for burial at New Montefiore. This was a missing photograph for which I was surely being blamed, and it was toward the locating of said photograph that I enunciated in well-trained high dudgeon. “Stephen,” I hissed, waving my hand toward the body of my dead mother-in-law and toward my gentle, anxious husband, the nonpracticing-physician-cum-municipal-servant. “Stephen,” I was saying, and here I held my hands out, curling my red-taloned fingers into two upwardly turned cups, indicating the approach he ought to be taking. “Stephen,” I sibilated, “you’ve got to dig.”

Meanwhile, Saul. Looming and shiny in his sharkskin suit. A disco ball with a beard occupying an entire corner of Sherman’s Flatbush Memorial Chapel’s cheapest reception room. Saul with his usual blank gaze. Giant, bushy-headed and bushy-faced, glittering-suited Saul. A man whom it was genuinely impossible to believe had ever been a hairless infant squeezed through a vaginal canal, or, if he had been, surely it was only to have pounced upon the waiting nipple with the greedy vigor and porcine lack of embarrassment with which he enjoyed his cigars.

Somebody in this room was going to have to step up and be a man and it sure as shit wasn’t going to be me, and please God it was also not going to be my daughter, who was now marching across the room while uttering that phrase that let me know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this daughter of mine was indeed a bulldagger. I watched with unblinking eyes as my husband cringed his way around his mother’s body and Saul glared from the cold-cut-plate corner, and here came my daughter, speaking that universal lexicon of bulldaggery, that language of hyperhelpfulness⁠—approaching the casket, rolling up the sleeves on her scrawny eleven-year-old arms like a foreman at a construction site, saying oh so tellingly: “I got this.”

I shook my head at my daughter and flashed the eyebrow again. No she did not got this. Not a person in the room understood what I was managing; no one comprehended the sheer effort that needed to be marshaled at all times to try to steer her toward womanhood. Stephen, in particular, refused to grasp the tragic path upon which she was set. I understand that to the people of today I sound like a monster, but between mother and monster no one in the history of philosophy has yet been able to distinguish, so why I’m even trying to explain this I don’t know. 

In any case, it was the photo of Saul’s children⁠—Leon and Ari⁠—that had gone missing. Thus Saul was the aggrieved one, and now that he had ravaged the deli plate, he was staring me down from the corner in hopes that I would produce the item in question from his mother’s ass crack, or confess that I had never placed the photograph in the casket to begin with. Extravagantly working his post-charcuterie gum in his thick jaws, he began paddling his way over to us.

“Find anything.” Saul delivered this not as a question but as an expression of triumph, the detective’s aha revelation of a bloody footprint. Then he gave me that look. Regarding my coat like it was a knife at Stephen’s throat. What was Saul, the mink police? I knew what he was thinking: Don’t you see how hard he works; you’re killing my brother for an imitation mink. Always me killing him. What about the way Stephen was killing me with his ambitionless dreams to be a servant of the public’s health. As long as he didn’t make money he was good. This farkakte equation had ruined my life.

“Look, Saul, if you really wanted to make sure the photo got in there,” I said, “you should have been at your mother’s bedside instead of tra-la-la-ing around at some yenemsveldt shtarker convention.” 

“National Association of Garmentory Executives.” Saul balled his hands in his pockets, extending his hips to the width of his shoulder pads.

Stephen, listening in, emitted a quiet humph of either protest or agreement. These expressions of his were never clear. His humphs were of a simultaneous recognition of the world and total refusal to intervene in its outcomes; that’s how Stephen humphed.

Stephen humphed again and began to rummage, his right hand nuzzled deep under his mother’s dead body, with his eyes turned toward the ceiling. He blinked and humphed again. He drew his hand out slowly, his mother’s navy dress settling back against the satin bedding. In his hand, a crumpled photo of Leon and Ari in yarmulkes and giant, ill-fitting blazers, squinting impatiently at the camera with the sun slashed across their faces. The Wailing Wall loomed across the background, caper plants bursting from the stones like the pubic tufts of bar mitzvees. Although it may have seemed that Saul was too stupid to know that the Middle East existed at all, bar mitzvahing your children at the Wailing Wall was all the rage for the parents of Rockland County. And so even Saul had made the holy trek, and now considered himself “worldly,” which was a hoot. Listen, you can be inhaling a boatload of I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt! at the Nanuet Mall one night and shitting it out in the bathroom of the Hilton Tel Aviv the next day, only to go right out to Dizengoff to load up on even more frozen yogurt. Lawrence of Arabia this was not. 

I grabbed Stephen’s wrist and waggled the photo in Saul’s direction. “What did I tell you? What did I fucking tell you, Saul?”

I was expecting some fabisine retort and began readying myself for one of our skirmishes, but instead a silence that was more than silence fell over him. It was one of those silences in a movie before a bomb goes off. In this ominous vacuum of sound, Saul’s face crumpled and the spongy balls of his cheeks scorched.

Then his eyes scorched too, illuminating a tapestry of inflamed capillaries across their dingy whites. It appeared that Saul was starting to cry. This was an alarming sight I was pretty sure few had ever seen. Worse, he was crying at me. Loud, burping sobs. Staring and shaking, and then he was opening his mouth.

Like a paramedic assigned to an emotion-prevention unit, Saul’s uncle Abe materialized and rushed over, throwing a thick arm around Saul’s shoulders. He yanked him into his chest sideways, a pile of damp dark suits.

“You’re all right, Saul,” Abe insisted. He pumped Saul’s shoulder a couple of  times, repeating, “You’re all right,” as if Saul were a tire that needed to be inflated back to its proper level of masculinity.

“I⁠—” Saul gasped, “I can’t …” He was still staring at me. Other relatives were emerging, clustering around Saul.

“What can’t you?” Abe prodded. “You need money?” Saul shook his head.

 “Leon⁠—” Saul garbled. His cheeks kept reddening. He was becoming incandescently overwrought.

Saul’s son Leon was a solid C student permanently marinating in Saul’s rec room with his gang of monosyllabic friends, who since puberty had all begun to take on the aura of underbaked loaves of bread, mounds of dough inside soft, crustless rinds. It was hard to imagine anything dramatic happening to Leon.

“⁠—got into a premed summer program. Leon. Leon’s going to be a doctor. And I can’t”⁠—Saul dipped his head⁠—“I won’t ever be able to tell Mom.”

Abe threw both hands in the air. “But this is a miracle, Saul!” His expression⁠—like a dog trying to puzzle out the workings of a doorknob⁠—suggested that, while pleased, Abe was as bewildered at the rise of Leon as I was.

“Mom,” Saul mewled into his own chest, and I did see him then as an infant, beefy in his crib. All his needs, his hunger, his unabashedness.




I had let not a flicker of emotion cross my face during Saul’s outburst. I saved it for after the funeral, at which point I immediately took to Stephen’s and my bedroom, crying, with the rest of the family clustering in the entryway like a pair of squirrels.

“Barbara?” Stephen sounded⁠—as he always did⁠—utterly mystified by the expression of any emotion whatsoever. It wasn’t that he was cold; he was unfailingly room temperature, like a scrap of chicken cutlet you scrape off your plate after dinner. Stephen unobtrusively mirrored the average aggregate heat of any room he was in. He was a rhythm guitar of a person.

There were times⁠—many, actually⁠—when I found this quality of Stephen’s comforting. But at this moment I was wild with grief and tears. Not over Blanchie, who, frankly, especially after she had seen fit to skip off to Boca as a widow, shirking her grandmotherly duties at the age of sixty-five to start a second life putting on budget musicals at the Century Village Hadassah, I did not care for. No, I was wild with grief over my daughter. I had realized something that day, and I couldn’t unsee it. My daughter was rubbing the bottom of her socked left foot absently over the top of her right one the way she used to comfort herself as a baby, staring at me curled on the bed like a snail, sobbing.

Stephen’s indulgent but patronizing concern, plus his pitiful shoulder squeeze, drove me further into despair. He was trying to smooth things over as quickly as possible, probably because he⁠—like I⁠—had just noticed the competitive crying start, with tears squeegeeing out of the corners of my daughter’s eyes.

I know it’s not right, and no one will admit this, but it’s entirely too easy to feel enraged by your child’s unhappiness. I’m not talking about the wailing of a baby, which is frustrating but not enraging. I’m talking about something that comes on later, glimmering into view around age six, and taking on its own animal shape until it becomes unavoidably apparent somewhere around twelve, thirteen. A familiar begins to appear on your child’s shoulder. 

In my especially miserable case, my daughter’s familiar was not an animal or a demon; her familiar, tragically, was a corduroy blazer. And about this blazer I shared the universal parental woe of witnessing your child wrestling with the void and coming up as empty-handed as you are, or worse. All this business with men’s clothes that had begun in tears over patent leather shoes at the age of three was evidence of a major misunderstanding on her part: she actually believed she could accouter herself out of the misery of femaleness. My feeling was: it’s not so easy to give degradation the slip. Even the makers of Flashdance knew it. Women are for touching. By men, by babies, by the hand of death.

And yet my daughter in her fascination with this blazer was trying to tunnel her way out. Something about the hubris of this insane proposition infuriated me. My daughter was headed for a disaster. I could see it and Stephen couldn’t, and so I was alone in facing down the urgency of this whole situation, which was going nowhere good and which Stephen kept calmly diagnosing as just one dot on the grand spectrum of human variation. Meanwhile, not so incidentally, this girl had been our ticket out of everything, and here we were still mired in the cold-cut platters of this world. But because I was “the mother,” my disappointment about all this could only be monstrous, and the fact was that even if I tried to explain what was upsetting to me, no one in this family would ever understand. 

By the way, this thing about my impossible sadness is what I was getting at earlier about the largerness and smallerness of motherhood. How somehow you become two totally different things at once. This irresolvable conflict-and-yet-entanglement of two mutually exclusive qualities (largerness and smallerness) constitutes motherhood as a state of being. It is also, I am compelled to mention, the definition of the dialectic, a concept that is dramatized perfectly by the tiny hall closet, which embodies the punishment of the Jews of Yorkville for their efforts at assimilation and, simultaneously, a promise: that of hiding a corduroy blazer from one’s bulldagger daughter. I’m talking about snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. That’s dialectics.

This brings me to my actual point, which I know is going to piss some people (a.k.a. Marxists) off. There’s dialectics⁠—tiny hall closets, a punishment that is also an opportunity, etc. And then there are some things that are just true. One person wins, one loses. Some things are just a battle to the death.

For instance, we didn’t scrimp and save to supplement the financial aid of a neoclassical palace of education where Etiquette and Typing were actual courses my daughter took for credit, where she learned to say croissant the right way (“cwahsahn”) and befriended girls with Park Avenue apartments as huge and humorless as statelets, so she could shuck off these opportunities with which she had been bestowed in order to become a mannish woman with a thing for books. Try to imagine the feeling of taking everything we sacrificed for her education and setting it on fire, because that’s what it felt like.

It was at Blanchie’s funeral that I realized I really had to face facts. The putrid claw of vulgarity had come to claim my family.  And it was Saul⁠—the world’s biggest schmuck, with his satin tracksuits and beer belly⁠—who was going to make it after all. Saul, who had raised his children like animals, was going to win.




If you must know, the truth was I had thought about not putting the photograph of Leon and Ari in the casket. 

There I was at Blanchie’s apartment in Boca, organizing her stuff, including the photo of Leon and Ari, and wondering, What if I just threw all these damn photographs in the garbage. The air was that aquarium-heavy Floridian stew, and even the wicker furniture was radiating heat off its spines. My patience was thin. Blanchie’s heart had finally gone to sea in its own fluid, Stephen was in the living room speaking with the Florida shipping associates of Sherman’s⁠—large goys who affected morose silence as a passable substitute for gravitas⁠—and I studied the photos Blanchie had selected to accompany her into eternity. Leon and Ari, egomaniacally radiating the supposed weight of history. And my daughter at the Parrot Jungle in Miami. Other girls her age, in the background, sported frosted lip gloss and dangly earrings. And there was my daughter, in shorts and a polo shirt, arms crossed, feet planted like a coach at a losing soccer game, scowling at the ground with jowls full of chewing gum and a parrot looming on her spiny shoulder like a ventriloquist’s puppet. A goddamn diesel dyke. A diesel dyke at the Parrot Jungle. 

It’s a phase, I tried to calm myself. It must be a phase. Or, okay, I would make it a phase by refusing to inter⁠—and thus monumentalize⁠—this photograph at New Montefiore in the family plot. I was hit then with the utter freedom of that moment, the ethical crossroads at which I sat poised. I felt overcome with the conviction that my daughter would never come around, never blossom into femininity, indeed would forever remain a sulking Mack truck if I sanctioned the reality of this photo by including it in the casket. I could anticipatorily erase this blight. I could do this by throwing out the photos without a further thought to it, like a dermatologist tossing a skin tag into a wastebasket. I could do this for my daughter. To give her a chance at a normal life. I could do this, simply, because I had to do it. Who would know if I just forgot to put the entire set of photos in there? Yes, the entire packet. Because God knows I wasn’t going to eliminate my daughter’s photo from its pride of place while allowing the photo of Leon and Ari into Blanchie’s casket for the ceremony.

Look, we didn’t know any better then. Certainly I didn’t. Where exactly was I supposed to have learned “better,” Ocean Avenue? Don’t make me laugh. But listen, I have had a lot of time to reflect lately. Not to mention I am always up on the latest trends, such as, at one point, Jazzercize, and I have had to reckon with some develop‑ments. Modern developments. Developments that have caused me to ask a question I never wanted to ask. Namely: What is a man? Well, the truth is, it doesn’t have to do with corduroy jackets. And, in fact, it doesn’t have a thing to do with genitalia either. What makes you a man is how you die.

Every dead man is a felled tree. But women die ignominiously, like dried-up raisins stuck to the bottom of a Sun-Maid box. Life has an order, a gendered order, no matter what shenanigans certain people may think possible. And what I’ve realized is that a woman’s body is, essentially, a desecratable thing.

Case in point: Blanchie in her blue dress.

Does it matter what “really” happened? Consciousness⁠—Dr. Freud said (yes, I know who Dr. Freud is)⁠—begins at the point of our forgetting. An excitation occurs, an insupportable one, and consciousness is the print it leaves, a jewel-roofed city in a cloud of smoke.

I didn’t do it, but I would have.

That’s what it means to be a mother. I don’t care how nice you are, becoming a mother grants a certain capacity to take action, like a hot holiday chestnut cracks open inside you. The absolute misery of having a child who themself remains childless is that they will never have any inkling of how many times you’ve had to take action on their behalf. I’m not saying the photo of Leon and Ari was one of those times, because I did put the photos in the casket, but I’m making a point about the fact that, before you’re a mother, you can weigh situations, you can waffle. Afterward, forget it.

There are some people who would contend that I’m not a very good mother. To those people I say, Fuck you."

    "text": "The refinery has been in continuous operation since 1909, a year after Henry Ford put all the horses out of business. In the beginning it was made mostly of wood. Teams of oxen heaved and strained and yanked steel cable through snatch block and tackle, raising heavy loads skyward.

The oxen are gone now, replaced by pickup trucks, forklifts, mobile cranes. The processing units are noxious and loud. Waves of heat rise off drums, pressure vessels, an endless maze of piping.

The place sits on twelve hundred acres. Part of it used to be a farm. Some of it was marsh. Sometimes, when I’m doing work out on the fringes, copper-colored grasses sway in sweet wind.

Butterflies seem possible.

Every once in a while, a confused seagull will make a nest on a high-up platform. When we climb the ladder, we get dive-bombed. They think we’re there to kill their egglings. No, we’re just trying to gently service the machines that are efficiently destroying the entire world.




Five of us took break in a slanted trailer. We were the welders, the mechanics. We could fix most anything.

As I came through the door, I took care to step over a hole in the floor.

Lou, our foreman, looked like a low-rent George Washington. He was eating a cranberry muffin and clearly had a story he was saving until a bigger audience arrived. When Joe and Dean finally came in, stinking of diesel, Lou raised his arms wide and said, “Fellas, I have news.”

“Here we go.”

“Goldie has come home.”

“Who?”

“Your cat?” Joe said in astonishment.

“Happened Friday night after car pool.”

They’d driven in together that morning in complete silence. Car-pool rules said no one was allowed to talk on the 5 A.M. ride up the highway. Story time was always saved for break. Which it was now: Monday, a few minutes after nine.

“Oh my God,” Joe said. “Where’s Mark? Does he know?”

“Maybe he saw it on Facebook.”

Dean leaned over and ripped the faded LOST CAT sign off his locker and we all had a good laugh. Mark liked to screw around⁠—⁠he’d printed that sign the same day Lou’s wife posted it on Facebook years before. He’d hung fifty-something posters, unit to unit.

Here’s what happened with Goldie. Lou had gotten a call from a veterinarian in Silverton, fifteen miles northeast of his place in Bamber Lake. Somebody had taken a kitty in for a checkup, and the vet found a microchip. Lou rushed to the vet’s office ready to punch the thief between the eyes. But the thief turned out to be a sweet old lady with a walker, who said the cat had shown up on her porch one misty morning.

Goldie now had long scars running down her flanks. The vet’s theory was that a hawk had grabbed the kitty and flown away. Carried her over the trees. Plenty of trees. Perhaps Goldie had slashed and thrashed or perhaps the hawk just got tired and let go. After that, maybe she had lived in the wilderness, recovering from her wounds, before stumbling across this little old lady’s house and becoming her beloved pet.

“Wait. She just surrendered her cat to you?”

“My cat.”

“She wasn’t upset?”

“A tad.” Lou was already starting to look like he wished he hadn’t told us any of this. He was turning pink, then red.

“I hope you didn’t go berserker.”

Lou was usually a mellow guy, but yes, he’d lost his mind at the vet’s office. When the lady began to cry, he snatched the cat carrier. She threatened to call the police. He deposited Goldie in his back seat and launched the empty carrier across the parking lot. To make matters worse, when they got home, Goldie attacked the other house cats that had come to replace her. Later that night she made a go at the cockatiels she’d loved when she was a kitten.

A few minutes after this revelation, Mark kicked open the trailer door and dug into one of his Mad Max road rage stories, as if everybody besides me hadn’t been in the same car during their commute. “Some guy in a blue Honda was playing tough at the merge but Dean heroically forced him into the guardrail. Sparks were flying.”

Lou’s eyes told me it was true.

“I do what I can,” Dean said.

Mark stuck something in the microwave and stood staring. His flattop got serviced every other Wednesday. Joe had a mullet he cut himself and it looked good, man. Real good. Dean was a jujitsu guy who shaved his head with a Bic every day during lunch.

These guys all lived an hour south on the parkway, down at the edge of the Pine Barrens. Owned small handsome houses on piney sugar-sand lots and swam in cold creeks or ran through sprinklers with their shrieking children. Chicken potpies for dinner. Dogs and exotic snakes to tend. Ex-wives or soon-to-be ex-wives. Worried over tax brackets and crypto. Had not a single college credit between them, same as me. Had calloused hands with random fingers severed at random joints. Bet on underdog horses and lost. Bet on champion NASCAR drivers and lost. Scrapped copper to get side money for ammunition or parts for dirt bikes or to take down to Atlantic City and slap down on black, just to lose that, too.

“Mark,” Joe said. “Did you hear?”

“Hear what, that every year it gets more impossible to drive in this state? Cars have doubled and motherfuckers still wanna drive under eighty in the slow lane.”

“Lou’s cat came back.”

“Southbound side, it’s clear sailing,” I said.

If I’d lived down where they did, we might have all ridden in together, in an old bread truck or a laundry van, tossing empty beer cans out the door, like brothers. Instead, I lived up in the mayhem of the city. Put up with apartment living, street parking, no yard, but got a peaches and cream reverse commute.

“The northbound side is fucked.” Mark turned and pointed at me. “All because assholes like him knit little blankies at the wheel instead of doing ninety like a man.”

“Goldie came home, Mark!” Lou shouted. “I forgot to tell you, you miserable prick!”

Mark took out whatever was in the microwave and sat down. “Congratulations.”

While we were on the subject that dictated most of their happiness or unhappiness⁠—⁠the highway⁠—⁠I googled the stats. “Says here thirty-eight thousand died last year in wrecks. They drove just like you jokers.”

I googled some more. “Ah, but according to this, only two hundred and ninety-four people died in aviation mishaps.”

“Your point?”

“Y’all should get a helicopter. Then you could even beat me home.”

Mark had ketchup in his mustache. He was our best worker. His diamond earring caught the fluorescent overhead.

“Say, now there’s something new from you⁠—⁠a good idea.”

Dean said, “Sure, let’s whirlybird.”

“Says here one costs three hundred and fifty thou.”

“We’d have to win the lottery.”

“You wouldn’t come to work anymore if you won.”

“Yes we would,” Joe said. “Show off our sweet-ass choppa.”

They’d been planning on pooling their cash to buy an electric car, but once they learned that the airfield next to the refinery charged only fifteen dollars per landing, their plan switched.

They looked down into their glowing phones.

“We can get a secondhand plane for what a Tesla costs.”

“My calculator says go-time.”

“Half the commute.”

They began the search that day.




The place made a lot of fuel, but its most abundant creations were feral cats. The contractors’ trailer compound was completely infested with them. Some walked with slippery stealth, in the shadows of tall structures, avoiding birds of prey. Leery, as if they had survived some apocalypse soon coming for the rest of us. Others weren’t afraid of anything. On sunny days, they lounged languidly, licking their buttholes. They all lived like kings and queens under the boardwalk. They dined on our garbage and multiplied.

We didn’t feed the cats. Feeding the cats generated cat shit.

We spray-painted neon circles around their shit and left it there.

The only one who fed them was Safety Jen.

When I met her, Safety Jen was in her mid-forties and had already worked at the refinery for twenty years. She had long blond hair and kind blue eyes. She spent her days auditing jobsites, making sure rules were followed. She looked out for the cats. If one ever got sick, she took it to the vet on her dime. At daybreak, she arrived in her little white pickup and the cats would surround her, purring and mewing, as she laid out trays of food.

The cats grew and grew.

Their shits ever bigger.

Then one day, refinery management deemed the cat situation out of hand.

Signs were hung all around our compound: DO NOT FEED THE CATS.

But Jen would not stop feeding them. Her job was threatened. When management came around at 5 A.M. to bust her, the feast was long over and all the chow cleaned up. She’d pivoted to 4 A.M.

My dealings with Safety Jen began the standard way⁠—⁠I’d be welding something on a scaffold fifty feet up in the air, sparks raining down, and then I’d see her coming and brace myself to be fired for something, anything. But she never did fire me. Maybe I was another animal she didn’t mind.




A few weeks after Goldie returned from her yearslong adventure, Lou’s wife wanted her out.

This was discussed in depth in our break trailer.

“Goldie despises our cockatiels.”

Dean laid it out: “One of those innocent birds has a cousin who flew off with Fluffy screaming. How would you feel?”

Lou began to crunch his apple.

“She comes home after the war and finds y’all are Team Birdie,” said Joe. “You’re lucky this pussycat doesn’t scratch your eyes out while you’re dreaming.”

“I don’t dream. I work here.”

“I’ve got a solution,” Mark said. “Keep the birds in their fucking cage where they belong.”

“Give the lady her cat back.”

“There’s an idea.” Lou set down his apple and dialed the vet on speakerphone.

When the vet answered, Lou apologized for the outburst he’d had at their office. He said he was ready to return the cat.

“Sir, I’m sorry,” said the vet. “It’s too late.”

“It’s never too late.”

“The woman has died.”

Lou dropped his head into his hands.

Joe shouted from the back, “Was it a broken heart?”




We joked around with Lou, saying if he didn’t get his home situation worked out, Goldie would have to come and live underneath the trailer with the other feral cats. There were so many of them, what was one more?

In my second year on the job, Safety Jen caught me over by the smoke shack and told me that the first refinery cats had been the pets of the Polish painters who’d been fired that spring. I remember that their warehouse and hoppers were painted bright purple, aquamarine, yellow, and mauve. The rest of the place was an uninspired rust bucket. They grew armies of sunflowers that stood in deep formation, and kept flower boxes full of purple veronica, Russian sage, asters, yarrow, peonies, tickseed, irises. A wooden sign at the entrance to their paint yard announced this tiny despot of color and life as Little Wałbrzych.

Aleksander, Dobrosław, and Mikołaj were grinning, pink-faced men. They weren’t like anybody else in the refinery, they weren’t miserable at all, were always smiling and asking you how you were. Calling you friend. Patting your shoulder. Shaking your hand. They didn’t hate working for a living, and nobody worked harder.

When you got out of your truck and walked through the dust, the door to the paint shop always opened and there would be Miko, waving. Slipping around his pant cuffs with every step was one of his beloved cats. Another would often be sitting on his shoulder.

Jen told me that when he’d immigrated to America with a single suitcase, Miko had also carried his cat, Zofia, a lavender-colored tabby, onto the ship. Zofia roamed the lower holds, catching mice, to the delight of the cooks. On the ship, she fell in love with a huge gray tom with a big head and heavy doglike paws. All night Miko heard them yowling beneath his bed.

Sixteen days later, Miko stood looking at the Statue of Liberty. Zofia sat on his shoulder. In his left hand was his suitcase. In his right hand he held a makeshift rope handle attached to a small crate. Inside was the snarling beast he’d named Lubomir, meaning “lover of peace.”

Miko moved into an apartment complex in Brooklyn that had been suggested by two friends he’d made on the ship. As his cats stalked pigeons, Miko, Aleksander, and Dobrosław began working odd jobs together, first as handymen, digging, chopping, painting. Beers in the sun after work, gazing out at the world under its soft dome, looking down from the roof of their building and seeing Lubo pounce on smaller cats and pummel them senseless. Zofia became pregnant with a litter of his kittens. When they were born, they were all like Lubo, wild and hard to control. But the apartment-complex rats were soon all dead.

Later, those three friends began painting houses in the suburbs, rented a little makeshift garage, did bodywork and paint jobs on half-wrecked Cadillacs. In the spring, they got a contract to become the maintenance painters and insulators for the refinery. Since there was a rat problem, the cats came along, too.

Miko, Aleksander, Dobrosław, and seven cats.




When she was first hired, Jen would stop by the paint yard on her lunch breaks and bring the cats snacks. Not long after, Zofia passed away. Lubo three days later. But the paint-yard descendants of Zofia and Lubo spawned on and on. When some oil-yard employee wound up with extra kittens at home, they never went to the shelter. They went to Little Wałbrzych.

One rainy day, after decades of excellent work, the Polish painters were unceremoniously kicked out. We were working nearby, welding in a new nozzle. Safety Jen started yelling and we looked over and saw the problem. Someone was high up on a scaffold, painting an overhead pipe, not wearing a fall arrest harness. She yelled again. The man got nervous, climbed higher into the rack, and made his escape atop four pipes going over the road.

“Who was that?” she asked us. “Was that Aleksander? Tell me the truth.”

None of us wanted to say. It didn’t matter. She saw Aleksander’s name written on the paperwork at the base of the scaffold. He was found gravely injured a hundred feet away. He’d slipped and crashed within sight of Little Wałbrzych.

They took Aleksander out in an ambulance and fired him at the hospital. The painters lost their contract that day. They gave Miko and Dobrosław one shift to get their things⁠—⁠there was time only to catch some of their most beloved cats, and tow the RVs.

The next day, the plant bulldozed their garden, and the remaining cats scattered. The refinery hired new painters, who took down the LITTLE WAŁBRZYCH sign and hung an American flag.




A cluster of lost deer wandered the road by the maintenance compound. They’d gotten in how they usually did, through the cemetery on the other side of the perimeter fence. Most of the time they were content eating grass off graves and flowers left at the feet of headstones, but sometimes they’d wade a creek and slip under a low section of razor wire. They would walk up the embankment with no idea why they’d wanted to get inside in the first place. Other deer remained on the opposite side, looking at the ones trapped there with us. For a time, neither could figure how to reach the others.

I drove my truck at a slow crawl through the herd, tapping the horn. For five years I’d worked steady with Dean, Mark, Joe, and Lou. But that morning, the car-pool buddies went to do some cake job.

Lou had sent me, alone, to the crude processing tower.

I climbed the ladder, rung after rung, a hundred and fifty feet, my radio squawking. At the top, huffing and puffing, I found two painters, squirrelly strangers in paint-speckled coveralls. One was pissing into a soda bottle.

A section of the platform walkway had to be reinstalled so the painters could access the south side of the tower.

I heard an air horn sound. The crane operator began to talk to me over the radio. In the blue sky, a large section of diamond plate hung on the crane’s crab-red claw, spinning like a toy on a string.

Beyond the diamond plate I saw brown smog skyline, bridges full of gleaming cars, the river full of noontime shine. Marshes dotted with minuscule white specks⁠—⁠either plastic shopping bags or egrets. The plant’s pollution-control scrubber tower pumping out an endless roiling exhaust.

One of the painters shouted that a length of steel rod was in the way, bowing over both sides of the narrow platform. The rod was secured with a yellow polypropylene rope.

“Hold it there,” I said into the radio. The cable stopped. I told the painters, “We gotta move that.”

One of the painters bent down and untied the rope.

Whoosh. Over the side the steel rod shot.

The three of us stood staring at the spot where the steel had been.

Then we moved to the railing and looked over the side.

Couldn’t see anything.

I leaned farther and the painters grabbed me as if I were about to jump.

The radio squawked. I couldn’t make out what the operator was yelling. I realized carpenters were working below us on the lower platform and there was a good chance we’d just murdered someone.

I left the two painters up top. Heart pounding, hands shaking. Halfway down the tower I saw that the steel rod had struck pipes, ripped insulation, and come to a stop on a low deck. The processing unit sounded normal. Delicate instrumentation narrowly missed. No fire. No explosion. But most importantly there were no slick puddles of crimson. Nobody impaled. Nobody screaming.

Suddenly the heat of the day hit and the unit was deafening. The crane operator was out of his seat and standing outside his machine with wild eyes.

I lamely pointed up to heaven.

“You almost …”

No one was around. Whoever had been below had scattered. Was now long gone. Like when you’re driving and you crash into another car and it’s your fault but the other car peels off because, well, you never quite know.

Later I found out that a group of carpenters had been less than ten feet from impact when the steel crashed between them. But the details of the story changed each time I heard it. The rod didn’t land ten feet away from the men, it landed eight feet, five, two. In another version of the story, the steel brushed one man’s cheek.

One of the bosses from the plant arrived and he was sweating and talking fast and saying he’d seen the piece fall. Was anyone hurt? Any equipment damaged? No and no. He told me to drag the steel off the platform and throw it into the back of his truck and he’d get rid of it because he did not want to fill out an incident report.

“Who else knows?” he asked.

“Nobody, really.”

I wondered if I could pass a drug test.

He was complaining about useless paperwork when Safety Jen’s truck pulled up.




The investigation began.

We were separated. The painters were interrogated in one red trailer. I was in another. I kept my version simple. Each time I got to the part where I told the painters to untie the rope, I realized that was where it all went wrong.

In their trailer they kept confessing to things that hadn’t happened, which made my interrogation even harder.

Safety Jen’s face got redder. “One more time from the top.”

Finally the door opened and Lou stepped in with doughnuts and coffee. Nobody had invited him. Nobody had the guts to make him leave. He took a seat and began to regale us with stories from the annals of constructions past.

“We’ve all lost perspective,” he said. “Every rule in the book was written in blood⁠—⁠that’s true. I’ve seen it. I’ve caused some blood. We learned from that. We can learn from this.”

Safety Jen pushed her glasses up. “Tell me how.”

“Hey, look. Shit happens,” Lou said.

“Every accident is preventable!” Safety Jen slammed her fists on the table. My coffee spilled, ruining my latest written confession.

Lou said, “Listen. It was 1976, bicentennial year. I still had my head stuck in a jug then. We all did. I was on a tower lowering scaffolding. Me⁠—⁠I’m so plastered, I tied the knot wrong and the rope slipped. The pole fell a hundred feet. Yeah, I see it in your face, you don’t know how that feels. But I do. I looked over and it was going at the ground guy. He sees it coming. I’ll never forget it. He steps off to the side, laughing. The pole stuck straight in the asphalt. Calm as a cucumber, he was. ’Course, he was the drunkest, that’s why we left him on the ground. I been sober at work ever since. Friday, July 2.”

Nobody said anything.

Lou continued. “If you’ve been around long enough, you’ve had something dropped on you. Works both ways. Get out of your office. Where the real work is, something’s falling on you.”

He turned around and tapped himself on the back.

“Right there,” he said. “A screwdriver fell seventy feet. Stuck in me. Drove me to my knees. I thought somebody threw it down at me on purpose. I yanked the screwdriver out and climbed the ladder, blood pouring down my back. When I got to the top, I was gonna kill the guy, but then I saw tears streaming down his face. I said, ‘Aw, damn, buddy, don’t cry.’ I consoled him till I lost consciousness. They had to lower me on a rope.”

Lou took my arm and pulled me out of the interrogation room.

“Come back,” Safety Jen said.

We walked out into the sunlight.

Lou said, “Let’s go talk to the guy.”

I said, “What guy?”

“The one we almost killed.”

In another cluster of trailers, we found the carpenter and pulled him into a private office so the three of us were alone together. Door closed.

He was smaller than I’d imagined. A pink bandanna was wrapped around his head. Reading glasses hung on a faux gold chain. His lip was split. He kept staring down at the cracked linoleum tiles.

Lou broke the silence. “We just wanted to say we aren’t scumbags. We care about what happened. We wanted to apologize.”

My hard hat was in my hands. “I made a mistake⁠—⁠”

Lou said, “We care, buddy.”

I opened my mouth to say something nice and the man began to bawl. He hid his face in his hands. “I couldn’t sleep. I drove my wife crazy. She was so angry. She go away. She say I’m nuts. But⁠—⁠”

“You’re not nuts,” Lou said. “I know how you feel.”

“I started going to church. I talk to God. I thank him I’m still here.” He wiped his eyes. “I become better person. I find him again after many years away. Let me pray for you.”

The man kneeled down and bowed his head. Lou looked at me like⁠—⁠what do we do?

But then the prayer ended and the carpenter stood back up, brushed off his knees. Beamed a smile. “God is good. God is so good.”

We shook his hand.

“I know she’ll come back.”

“Definitely.”




End of that week, I was laid off, even though there was plenty of work to do. I called the union hall to get back on the list and the old man on the phone said, “Kid, you really screwed the pooch.” He slammed the receiver against his desk and then shouted that I was a dumb motherfucker. The line went dead. I didn’t blame anybody. Not Lou, not Dean, or Mark, or Joe.

Sometimes I would get a text from one of them asking how I was doing. I lied and said I was doing fine, but I was working night shift at a garbage-burning power plant. That’s how I was doing.

The place stank like twice-putrefied death. When you worked in the great enclosure of the boiler, there would come an unpredictable time when the boss would call on the radio with panic in his voice, “The gas is coming on, drop the tools!” And we’d hurry out of the hatch and sever the welding leads and electric cords and swing the hatch shut with a thunderous clang and bolt it closed just as the incinerators fired up and everything inside sparked, cindered, burned into eternal soot.

The EPA eventually shuttered it, which was all for the best.

I’d been banned from three laundromats.




They finally found their plane, a Cessna Skyhawk, at a yard sale in Forked River. Mark spotted it beside the barn. Partially covered with a ratty tarpaulin. The homeowners weren’t even trying to sell it. Nineteen thousand, cash money. Needed so much work.

Mark and Lou and Dean and Joe texted me photos of the plane, each with some variation of “lol.”

Bent propeller. Tricycle undercarriage. Tan with a raspberry stripe. Engine gone kaput. Extensive damage to the rear.

“Nothing we can’t fix.”

The Cessna had been owned first by the state’s forest service, which had used it to spot wildfires. Later, it was sold to a pediatrician named Fred Molloy, who flew it out of Miller Airpark on meditative, lackadaisical pleasure tours over farmland and stretches of bay coast, smoking cigars and listening to Bach. When he got Parkinson’s, the Cessna was gifted to his nephew, who planned to upgrade the instrument clusters and yoke, but then a freak storm downed a tree across its tail fin.

The car pool was undeterred.

Joe, who had worked in a body shop in his youth, took on the reconstructive work on the tail and wings. Lou and Dean disassembled the engine, cleaned, polished, applied fluids and lubricants, installed seals, spark plugs, and belts. A new propeller was bought off Craigslist, eBay had the windows, Facebook Marketplace had a tail fin.

Mark got his pilot’s license. In the beginning he flew with a helmet and parachute, but before long he was pulling barrel rolls without his seat belt on.

They’d send goofy videos from the plane. I could tell they missed me.

I texted, “Y’all gonna eat it.”

The reply was “We eat ass, Mo.”

“Grim reaper’s ass,” I wrote.

All that summer and into the fall they flew to work. The rest of the suckers drove. They soared through the dark, sticking increasingly confident landings on the runway next to the refinery. They’d made friends with the air traffic controller and weren’t even paying the landing fee, because Joe was reupholstering the guy’s boat.

Each morning, lunch boxes pinned between handlebars and chests, Mark, Lou, Dean, and Joe rode their electric scooters from the airfield, taunting one another through avenues of sleeping row houses and into the contractor lot with everyone else, bumping along on uneven gravel, headed to the turnstiles.

Normal commuters, getting out of their trucks, miserable from their long drives, would see them scoot by, and would remark to their traveling companions, “Who are those clowns?”

“Oh, you don’t know? They got a private jet.”




It’s hard to say whose fault the crash was. It was a foggy day at the end of September. Visibility low. Some say it was Dean’s “turn to drive.”

Their plane crashed into the train bridge at the marsh end of the facility. A wing ripped off. Wreckage scattered into the murky water. The propeller was sent skipping across the reeds. Someone on the turnpike called 911. Shouting paramedics with sweeping flashlights arrived. The sun was cresting and geese were screaming over the growl and flash of ten thousand cars. The fog cleared. The lights of the airfield runway became visible an eighth of a mile away. Nobody was saved.




I didn’t recognize Safety Jen in street clothes. She grabbed my arm outside the funeral home and said she was sorry.

She introduced herself as “Jennifer” to my wife.

I said, “This is Safety Jen.”

Apparently Jen had no idea we all called her that.

She said they’d tried to make her turn in a report on the crash but she’d refused.

“Only some of the wreckage was on our property.” She looked devastated. “I don’t think I can do this.”

My wife took her hand and we all walked in together.

The funeral home was crowded with guys from my union hall. Three more services would follow in the coming days. This wake was for Lou.

There was a poster board covered in photos of him. Some were from the plant long before I got there, others were just of his life, his real life.

The old man who worked the phones at the hall ambled over. He was holding two cups of coffee and looked lost. He said it was a damn shame.

We turned to look at Lou’s casket. Closed, of course.

“I’ll tell you something,” he said. “They were bragging about fixing a leak with a Coke bottle and duct tape.”

“Heard the same.”

A man in a buttercup-colored suit walked past the wall of flowers and stopped at Lou’s casket. He took out rosary beads. Even though he wasn’t wearing a hard hat, coveralls, or steel-toe boots, I knew him.

He was the man who’d found God.

He had grown a beard and he was mumbling a prayer. I almost went up and said hello to him, but then I thought, Ah, once was enough.

Two other people walked in. I didn’t recognize them at first. Miko and Dobrosław stood at the poster board pinning up photos⁠—⁠at least ten years of Lou, helping them plant and water the sunflowers in Little Wałbrzych. I turned and looked for Jen but she was nowhere to be seen. When I looked back at Miko and Dobrosław, she’d found them. Don’t you know it, they were crying, those three were hugging.




More coffee. Cookies. Everyone cleared out. But Lou’s dazed widow had my shirtsleeve. She said the strangest thing. The morning of the crash, she’d put their cat on a leash and made Lou take her to work.

“The cat was on the plane?” Safety Jen asked.

The widow nodded. Goldie had been exiled to live with the feral cats at our trailer compound. She insisted that Goldie had been responsible for the crash, had thrashed out of Lou’s grip, lunged at the pilot, and slashed a vital wire.

I could see it. After what had happened to her, that cat was deathly afraid of flying.




In the end, I got my old job back. There were only so many guys from our hall with the certifications. Cherry on top, I hadn’t killed anyone.

The first morning back, I went to the same red trailer where I’d been interrogated. This time it was for my annual safety orientation refresher. The instructor popped in a DVD. For all my years prior, it’d been a VHS, one I’d long memorized.

“They just redid it. Enjoy.”

The video began with a new animation. Three cartoon figures were standing on top of a silver tower. One lone cartoon was working below. I started to sweat.

Safety Jen’s ominous narration began: “The day started just like any other …” The point of view changed. Close in. On top of the tower. I saw cartoon me talking into a cartoon radio. The cartoon painters were scrambling around. The piece of cartoon steel fell off the top of the cartoon tower and almost killed the cartoon carpenter below.

Other topics covered in the video were: hazardous chemicals and the health hazards associated with each. Procedures for evacuation, the siren corresponding to each type of emergency. Muster points, wind direction, access and egress. Personal protective equipment, fire-retardant clothing. How to don banana-colored chemical suits. The use of respirators and self-contained breathing apparatuses, the kind firefighters wear to go into burning buildings.

I got a hundred on the test. The only new thing in the video was me.




The break trailer was full of new guys who looked like they’d been ordered fresh out of a catalogue. They were sitting in the seats my dead flying friends had sat in all those years. I waved hello and nobody knew me. I figured that was just as well.

Lou’s disgusting table had a little brass plaque glued to it that said: THE LOU GARRISON MEMORIAL BREAK TABLE.

Dean’s disgusting table had a brass plaque glued to it that said: THE DEAN “DONGMAN” DUDLEY MEMORIAL BREAK TABLE.

Joe’s disgusting table still had all the cans of chewing tobacco piled in the corner where he used to sit. His plaque said: THE JOSEPH BETT MEMORIAL BREAK TABLE.

Mark’s table didn’t have a plaque. I took a few pens out of his Dr. Dre coffee cup. Put them in my pocket.

I would have sat down in my old seat, but there was some young guy sitting there and I could tell this was his first job. He looked nervous. I looked at him a little too long and he said, “Am I in your seat?”

I shook my head and sat in Lou’s chair.

The young guy tapped one of the plaques glued to the tables.

“Who were these guys?”

“Complete idiots.” I leaned back and put my feet up. “Just like you and me.”




In my absence, the cat population had grown exponentially. My first job back had to do with them.

When Safety Jen heard that the refinery finally planned on trapping and removing the strays set loose from the garden utopia of Little Wałbrzych, she went to the manager’s office and fought for them to stay. This was their home, and as bad a home as it was, if they went to a shelter, the majority would face a death sentence. Jen told management that if they didn’t back down, she would go to every newspaper and every radio show and would never stop posting on social media about how the refinery murdered cats.

A tractor trailer brought an empty forty-foot-long shipping container with Russian words on its side. We had other shipping containers similar to this one where we kept our rigging⁠—⁠metal slings, chain falls, come-alongs⁠—⁠and where our tools were stored in great wooden bins packed with wrenches, sockets, sledgehammers. But this shipping container was special. It was just for cats and things to make cats happy.

Safety Jen had us place the cat sanctuary a quarter mile from the trailer compound, near a little stretch of woods beside a lake.

As we packed up the crane, a forklift brought a pallet of hay bales. “What are we supposed to do with these?”

Jen wasn’t laughing. “You know what the hay bales are for.”

“For horses?”

“For the cats!”

Four of us began to place the hay bales in the shipping container. Safety Jen followed us in. “No. They go the other way.” She held up a blueprint.

We laid the hay bales out in rows, so the cats could climb and perch. We spread loose hay on the floor. A wooden spool of rope, six feet in diameter, was placed on the west side, so the cats could sharpen their claws. A wooden ladder granted rooftop access for sunbathing.

It was cat paradise, with only one hitch⁠—⁠the distance of the sanctuary from the trailer compound. Just before end of shift, Safety Jen had us spread a trail of cat food along the road. The next morning, dozens of cats were still lounging around the compound. Not a single one had followed the trail.

Safety Jen appeared in the mist, waving her arms, pointing to the food. “Follow me, follow me.”

The cats looked at her. None budged. She whistled. A few walked away.

Someone said, “The pied piper had a flute. You need a flute, Jen.”

She walked down the road, motioning toward the morning-dew-bloated cat food. A lone tom began to follow her, but when Jen whistled again, he sat on his haunches and then seemed to shake his head no.

They trapped some of the cats that night.

Brought them to the sanctuary.

Whenever a morning count was taken at the sanctuary, it was always lower than the number that had been taken there the previous shift. The cats had either walked back to the maintenance compound in the night or met their untimely end from the bald eagle who’d made a nest not far away.

Next, we disassembled the sanctuary and all its amenities, and transported it to within sight of our very own trailer compound. But the cats did not use this relocated sanctuary either. They continued to lick their paws and make their babies under our trailers, and fight and beg for food. Just like every other living organism on earth, they lived their short, miraculous lives. And to this day, neon circles are still painted around their fresh dumps.




One morning as I came in, I noticed, off to the side of the trailers, a black cat with strange gold speckles and splotches. There were two kinds of feral cats at the refinery: the gargantuan sons and daughters of Lubo, with big heads and wide cheeks that looked like they were packed with chewing tobacco, and slinky ones who took after Zofia, lithe with jade eyes, always looming, staring, nonplussed. This cat was neither. She looked like she’d been through a war. She followed me first up onto the boardwalk to the wash-up trailer. I went inside for a minute but came out to find her still sitting on the deck, watching me. Then she followed me inside the break trailer. Something I’d never seen a refinery cat do.

I took the food out of my lunch box and put it in the fridge like I always did. When I walked back to my table, the cat had climbed into the lunch box. The door to the trailer opened and the new foreman said, “What are you doing? Job got canceled. Hall didn’t call?”

He stood talking to me for a while about how fucked up the business was, how hard it was to make a living these days. He didn’t notice the cat curled up in my lunch box. The foreman said maybe there would be some work at the refinery in a couple of weeks and that I should keep my phone on. He shook my hand, and that’s when I realized I’d been laid off again.

As he walked out of the trailer, the cat began to yowl. The foreman stopped in the doorway and gave me a look.

“It’ll be all right,” he said. “You’re a good worker. Hang in there.”

The door closed.

I noticed the cat had scars on her sides. I gave her some of the ham off my sandwich. Purring and drooling. I closed the lunch box on her and walked out of the trailer, down the boardwalk, through the turnstiles, and to my car, where I set the lunch box on the passenger seat and lifted the lid. The cat sprang out and ran across the dashboard and bounded off the steering wheel, springboarding over my head into the back seat.

I said, “My mom has a yard with a garden. Lots of little birds come there. Squirrels too. Okay?”

It was a long, slow, harrowing drive down the turnpike, but somehow she and I arrived at my mom’s house in one piece.

“Happy birthday,” I said. Though my mother didn’t want the cat, she brought out a saucer full of milk.

“Take her to the city.”

“This little kitty’s been through enough.”

She worried that my father’s poodles would hurt her, the way they had hurt every previous cat my mother had ever owned, including her most recent one, a perfectly sweet old girl who had surely been driven to an early death. “This one can handle herself.”

“Does she have a name?”

“Goldie.”

Goldie looked calm now. She followed me through the fence and into the backyard.

My mom got more milk and a bowl of wet dog food and placed it on the ground. Goldie ate and drank and then went and sat under the picnic table in the shade, watching bees and ants and bluebirds.

Mom and I sat in the yard, drinking coffee while she chain-smoked. The clouds went by.

When my father came home at dinnertime, Mom and I were still out back with Goldie. The poodles began to bark like mad. Nothing drove Mom or me crazier than hearing those poodles, but my dad had trained them that way. I heard him now, distantly, yelling, “Kill, kill, kill!”

The back door opened a moment later and out came two terrible white fluff balls. Goldie dashed out from under the picnic table and slashed both dogs’ faces, and then, while they were retreating, she bit each on the ass. One poodle ran to the left and the other to the right. Goldie hissed and arched her back.

Dad was screaming. Mom snuffed out her cigarette. The poodles went back into the house and pissed on the rug and cried. When I got back into my car, the poodles were already in the bay window, staring at me, but for once, they were quiet.

I went home to the city.

A few days later, Dad called to say that Goldie was still launching attacks against the poodles every time they went into the yard, was drawing blood, going for the eyes. One poodle now needed special eye drops. The attacks were destroying the dogs’ confidence. He had to take them onto the front lawn, leashed, to go to the bathroom.

He wanted me to get Goldie out of the backyard, but I didn’t have that kind of power.

The house got quiet. Mom’s headaches went away. In time, the poodles became docile. They would trot onto the back lawn and Goldie would follow. Now that the poodles were mute, they would sometimes even catch a chipmunk near the woodpile. Goldie would watch them, licking a splayed foot while dandelion seeds drifted by and the ice cream man’s music echoed down the block. When the dogs retreated into the house, Goldie would slink over to where the chipmunk lay and begin to crunch.

SCENE

A family wedding.

 

ASTA

What you want is for me to play with little cats. Talk to little cats. Make movies about little cats.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Well, we have a cat.

 

ASTA

I’m much too busy.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

What’s that book you’re reading?

 

ASTA

Library book.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Stories?

 

ASTA

How to quarter a buffalo.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Oh.

 

ASTA

How to breathe underwater. How to sharpen almost anything. Useful skills. I can keep it a year, I have five library cards.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

We won’t worry about you, then.

 

ASTA

You don’t worry about me anyway. You think I’m simple.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Oh you’re not simple. Nazis are simple. You’re straightforward.

 

ASTA

I collect facts.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

You do collect facts.

 

ASTA

I don’t always know what they amount to till the time comes.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Is that why you’re always up on the roof? Waiting till the time comes?

 

ASTA

There are days my heart is sore.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

I know that.

 

ASTA

And sitting on the roof I can listen to everything, all you janky crowd downstairs, if I put my ear to the drainpipe.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

I know that too.

 

ASTA

Was nicer up there before the angels left.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

They left?

 

ASTA

Didn’t like the cat. So what’s happening now? Photo session?

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Photos on the balcony.

 

ASTA

Glad to miss that.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

But you’ll come down later? Come down for the cake.

 

ASTA

Later.

 

Exit Asta to the roof, where she listens through the drainpipe to conversation continuing downstairs, and occasionally comments; the drainpipe is heard making drainpipe sounds intermittently from now on.

 

UNCLE HOD

Never enough to go round.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Enough what?

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

Will the bride be down soon?

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

I do hope so. She’s been weeping for a week.

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

Is there any beer?

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

You’re not having beer, you’re nine.

 

UNCLE HOD

I suppose Asta’s on the roof.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Do you take milk?

 

UNCLE HOD

Thank you, no. She’s quite a kid. You know, she interviewed me once.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

For her imaginary magazine?

 

ASTA

It’s not imaginary. God! Don’t they know me at all?!

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

What kind of questions she ask you?

 

UNCLE HOD

She asked about trust, as I recall. The kind of chaps I trust. The kind of chaps I have to deal with.

 

ASTA

Trust! Ha! Not likely! I asked him about rock salt and buckshot and how you mix them half and half.

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

Not prison?

 

ASTA

Rock salt just melts away. You don’t leave no forensics.

 

UNCLE HOD

Prison was the politest place I ever lived.

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

You know what would be really funny?

 

ASTA

Here he goes, one of his idiot-brother joke ideas. What do you bet⁠—

 

UNCLE HOD

Everyone saying good morning, no one pushing in the queue.

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

If we let Odd Otto think⁠—

 

THE EVANGELICAL COUSINS

The very stone that the builders rejected …

 

ASTA

I knew it! Always going after Odd Otto. As if he doesn’t have enough! Trouble! Being Odd!

 

MERCED

Saturdays make me sad.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Oh dear, Merced’s having a sad day.

 

UNCLE HOD

Is Otto the ambidextrous one?

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

Ask him to be ring bearer!

 

ASTA

Idiot brother thinks that would be funny. To make Odd Otto do the rings. Because Odd Otto has anxiety. Odd Otto does everything with both hands at once⁠—writing, eating, putting in his earplugs⁠—it has to be symmetrical, or he gets anxious.

 

MERCED

We’d sit on the back porch, all of us, singing and talking and grinding the querns.

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

There would have to be two rings! or four rings! or who knows!

 

THE EVANGELICAL COUSINS

The very stone that the builders rejected Is become the cornerstone.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

I have a slight feeling of precipice.

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

Should we go to the balcony? Set up the group shot?

 

ASTA

Otto has male days and female days. They get all haughty-snorty about it, the family.

 

MERCED

Grinding, singing. Saturday was for weddings.

 

UNCLE HOD

What’s a quern?

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Perhaps standing with the sea behind us?

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

No matter what you ask him he says, Oh, oh! Yes, yes!

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Or should we try to be not facing the light?

 

MERCED

All so happy, grinding.

 

ASTA

I interviewed Merced once. About grinding. It wasn’t all so happy, actually. She said it took all day to grind enough grain for a wedding. And you have to grind in one direction only, one direction always, clockwise always. Or you call up the Devil. She’d laugh. Then she’d get really scared.

 

UNCLE HOD

Curses always backfire.

 

MERCED

You got that right.

 

UNCLE HOD

Curses bring regret.

 

MERCED

Big regret.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Oh don’t get her going.

 

Enter Other Uncles.

 

OTHER UNCLES

Drinks up yet?

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

There’s hot tea in the urn.

 

UNCLE HOD

Only one thing in my life I would undo.

 

ASTA

Oh no, he’s in that mood.

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

’D be hilarious. Both hands at once.

 

ASTA

You fart-arse. Go away and eat tadpoles.

 

MERCED

Curse the grain, ruin the marriage.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

A family has a violence older than itself. They become a mob.

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

He just says Oh, oh! Yes, yes! to anything.

 

THE EVANGELICAL COUSINS

Little children, love one another.

 

UNCLE HOD

I mean in the scheme of things.

 

OTHER UNCLES

I’m just saying, you go where you’re sent. I was third flotilla.

 

MERCED

Clockwise always.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

More hot water, Merced? For the tea?

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

I think we really need the bride at this point.

 

MERCED

Or out comes the Devil.

 

ASTA

Did he say “in the scheme of things”? He says that a lot. I like the idea of there being a scheme.

 

OTHER UNCLES

Well, it’s twelve years but I’m still in fight mode. I miss the lads.

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

Can’t you just march in and say, Ticktock, baby girl?

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Oh dear no.

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

Many a mother bargains with a daughter.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Oh no.

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

Aren’t you the boss?

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

We’re pouring toward the precipice now.

 

Whistling is heard.

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

Who makes these rules?

 

Sound of whistling.

 

ASTA

Good question.

 

OTHER UNCLES

Who’s that whistling?

 

ASTA

Another good question.

 

UNCLE HOD

It should never have happened.

 

ASTA

Ah, soon he’ll say, I don’t do innocents.

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

How about the groom, is he available?

 

Sound of whistling.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Shaving. With a new razor.

 

OTHER UNCLES

I miss the firefights.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Don’t you wish we’d got roses, not lilies. The lilies look a bit mythic.

 

ASTA

Did she say “mythic”? It’s a code word for her. Oh Asta, don’t be mythic. Days when my heart is sore. I try to keep my life mainly separate from her. But I’m going to write a book threaded through with the soreness of my heart. So she’ll know. How it felt, how it feels, those days I suddenly remember things⁠—how we used to go all the family together to a summer place we had⁠—I still see it so very clearly, that place, that time, the pure blue blazing morning and all the world open, all the day tight in its web of its own self-oblivious self, slipping along, and me in it, me slipping along that thick time with me in it, me then, me already gone, the mythology of me, I see it as close as my hand yet I can never touch it again. Am I ridiculous? People think kids have no fear of time, no sense of the past, because they’re kids. Wrong. Me waiting in the shadows of then, nothing is more terrible.

 

MERCED

Who’s that whistling?

 

UNCLE HOD

I don’t do innocents. It haunts me still.

 

OTHER UNCLES

You wear gloves all the time, Hod, those gray gloves, why’s that?

 

UNCLE HOD

Who shaves the barber? Old joke. Know it?

 

ASTA

I need to think again about the scheme of things.

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

What’s a quern?

 

Sound of whistling.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Someone should look it up.

 

ASTA

The angels left because the cat kept sneezing. Is that the scheme of things?

 

MERCED

Stupid English word.

 

ASTA

Or Uncle Hod saying, I was a businessman. My business was crime. Is that the scheme? I studied mythologies once. For the scheme. Mythologies are sad, too sad. Like Baldr. Do you know this myth? The other gods loved Baldr so much they didn’t want him to die so his mother traveled round and got each thing in the world to vow it would not harm him. Stones, storms, poisons, knife blades, everything in the world swore a vow. The gods were joyous. They stood Baldr in their midst while they shot at him and sliced at him and knocked him down and laughed. Laughing, they forgot mistletoe. No one asked a vow of mistletoe. They thought she was too young to swear a vow. So a passing blind man shot mistletoe at Baldr, who fell down dead. What I mean by the sadness is this dark, dark, dark stupidness at the heart of it. Uncle Hod has that. Kills people as a business all his life, then goes to prison for an accident. Twenty years to life with four off. The scheme of things. I don’t do innocents.

 

A loud cry is heard and the thud of something heavy falling.

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

What’s that sound?

 

ASTA

Something going on down there.

 

OTHER UNCLES

Who was that whistling?

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

Did you know he had it?

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Had what? Who’s whistling?

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

I saw him putting something in his pants earlier. Looked like a machete.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Why are people staring?

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

Thought it was a joke.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

What’s that on the floor?

 

OTHER UNCLES

Well, he had enemies.

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

Think they’ll give me the machete? After?

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

Revenge, oh my.

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

But can I have the machete? After?

 

ASTA

Go sleep in a snake pit, barbarian.

 

OTHER UNCLES

That barber joke. He was trying to tell us something⁠—

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

I do so ache to be taken care of.

 

THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE

Let’s check if he’s dead.

 

ASTA

I doubt he’s dead. Uncle Hod is tough. But there’s the scheme again. If Uncle Hod had practiced switch skating in prison, like Odd Otto did, instead of chess, he might have looped the loop on that machete and not be lying on the floor right now. But Uncle Hod had a fatal streak. In this game you can’t blame anyone but you, he used to say, and on the surface he was talking about chess but really he meant that guy who strangled on the gag. Accidental mishap amidst a perfectly planned robbery. I don’t do innocents. Blame makes you sad, sadness makes you stupid, you forget the mistletoe. Smart feet might have saved him. I do hope the angels come back. I’ve swept and dusted. I guess I should go downstairs. Left to themselves they just lie to each other, the family. I wonder if I will learn to do that too, growing up. Don’t turn away, the angels used to say. Their heads would glow silver.

 

THE PHOTOGRAPHER

Did we find out what a quern is?

 

OTHER UNCLES

What did you mean, joke?

 

Sound of whistling.

 

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE

Shall we put the shutters down?

    "text": "With all the layovers, it took us almost thirty hours to get from Los Angeles to Qingdao. In the Tokyo airport, while we were waiting for our next flight, Mother and I got into a fight. It was my fault⁠⁠—I made fun of her for playing too much Candy Crush on her big Samsung phone.

“This is beneath you,” I said. “This is the kind of thing for people with low intelligence.” We were sitting in one of those airport food courts, so there were a lot of people getting up and down and chairs scraping and orders being called out and such.

She didn’t look up.

“You’re polluting your mind,” I continued. “What if we go to the bookstore?” I tugged on her arm. “We can see if they have any books in Chinese.” I was always trying to get her to read.

“This is why you have no friends in school,” she said, looking up finally. “Because you read too many books.”

But this wasn’t true. When I was in elementary school, yes, I had no friends, but that was because one day in third grade, I wore my professional short-shorts to school and they were so tiny that my ass was kind of hanging out and then this tall white girl, Lisa, told everyone on the playground that I was a slut. While I was playing with the wood chips and monkey-barring or whatever, she went around and whispered seriously into people’s ears, “Look at that slut, running around.” None of us knew what that meant, that word. Only that it was not okay. Also I was too big in elementary school, like a foot taller than everyone else. That’s another reason why people didn’t like me, probably.

But now I had just finished sixth grade, and the Percy Jackson series was huge. I told Mother about the time I’d brought a copy of The Mark of Athena to school the day it came out and this one girl who sat next to me in homeroom literally got down on her knees in front of everyone and begged me to let her borrow it for homeroom reading. The teacher had to come over and be like, You can’t get down on your knees in homeroom like this. I told Mother this as if to say, See, books can be cool, can even make people come down to their knees, which for Chinese people is very big news, people coming down to their knees, and she said, “Why would you call me dumb?”

“What?”

“You can’t call your own mother dumb,” she said. “That’s really mean.” 

“Ma, I didn’t call you dumb.”

“Yes, you did!”

“No, what I’m saying is, you’re doing something a dumb person would do. You don’t want to be mistaken for a dumb person, right?”

She went back to playing Candy Crush in a big fuck-you kind of way and continued to play on the plane. “You’re not dumb, okay,” I said, when we got to our seats. “I’m sorry,” I kept saying, but she stayed steadfast in ignoring me. So I did a practice AMC 10, which stands for American Mathematics Competitions, tenth grade, and the rest of the time I slept soundly. Mother, on the other hand, who has not been able to sleep a lick since the year she got pregnant with me, watched Skyfall instead, the one with the Adele song, because it was one of the few movies on the plane that had Chinese dubbing. And also because she liked Adele, which is another thing about Chinese people. All Chinese people love Adele.




When we got to the hotel, it was the afternoon. We fell asleep promptly and when we woke, it was three in the morning. Without turning on the lights, so I could try for some more sleep, Mother got my primary blade out from the luggage and started to reglue the rubbers, so that they would be ready for the big day ahead. Over the years of gluing my blades, she had become a maestro, so much so that grown, sweaty men back home paid her handsomely to glue their rubbers, although I suspected that they used this as an excuse to get closer with Mother, who walked around the club in red stilettos and lipstick, picking up balls from every corner. She did this with various ball-picking-up instruments, a long black tube with rubber bands at the ends, a thin net connected to a pole, and she looked beautiful. She really did. The men paid her fifty bucks for the whole process, which I always felt was an injustice. Mother’s gluing was worth so much more. It took so long and filled the whole room with fumes, and of course the men would imagine her at home, in the privacy of a bedroom, in her soft home clothes, gluing, waiting for the liquid glue to tense up into a clear, stiff substance, and that was worth more than fifty dollars, I think. Mother knew it, of course, but she wanted to be good to everyone⁠⁠—she wanted the men to play with me, to give me more games, more of their sweaty time.

I sat on the bed in my little white underwear, my back against the headboard, and Mother sat at the hotel desk, her back turned to me, peeling the Hurricane 3 from my blade and removing the old, dried glue by rubbing at the rubber and the wood with the pads of her thumbs. She brushed on the Haifu Dolphin speed glue and fanned until it dried. She added her secret ingredient: Johnson’s Shea & Cocoa Butter Baby Oil. Drifting in and out of sleep, I watched her, the sky starting to blue, the birds starting to chirp, the smell of speed glue mixed with cocoa butter becoming ever more nauseating and pleasurable.

In the morning, a green cab took us halfway up a mountain and into a forest, until we reached a huge sliding gate amid some trees. We went up all these horrible dirt roads, but the driver seemed to know exactly where the potholes were and would slow the car nearly to a halt before each one. The car would lurch to one side and Mother would press solidly into me or me into her and we went like this the whole way there, sliding into each other. We went through the gate, past all these unnatural beige buildings jutting out of the nature, until we made it to the Playing Hall, which was an enormous concrete brick of a building. There were stairs, a lot of them, that led up to a small red door. Surrounding the place: sand. A thick moat of sand. It was all so hot and white and bright, my eyes burned from looking. In the distance, forest. Which was a strange combination, I felt. Fine white sand and then forest. 

We went through the door into the biggest room I had ever seen, where about a hundred kids my age were marching in a single-file line that curled around the perimeter. As they marched, they stretched, swinging their torsos left-right-left-right in sync. One lone voice rang out, a boy in the line, chanting a count to which the others moved. As the stretch ended, another began, and the next voice in line picked up the count without breaking the beat. It wasn’t really chanting but singing, the one-two-threes attuned to a melody they all knew. 

High-ceilinged and without supporting beams, the inside of the Playing Hall looked like a nice place to house a few commercial airliners, but instead there were fifty ping-pong tables, arranged five by ten. The place was so large you could hardly see the end of it.

Someone approached us. An adult. “My name is Shao,” she said, offering her hand to Mother. “You must be the little American,” she said, turning toward me. She was smiling wide, with perfect teeth. She had really nice skin. “Oh, he’s pretty,” she said to my mother. Mother laughed. All moisture had left my mouth. “Here, you two stay put,” said the one with the name Shao. “I’ll go upstairs and get Dong Dao.” The kids were still stretching and circling and singing. 

Dong Dao came down some stairs, his hands gripping the handrails firmly during his entire descent. He had a lot of wrinkles on his face, like a French bulldog. He pointed at me and curled one gargantuan gnarly finger in a “come here” motion. I went over to him at a light run. Mother watched us from a distance. All the other kids were still stretching. They seemed to have a never-ending amount of stretches to do. 

“Your coach called me yesterday,” he said. “We talked about you.” 

“Oh.” 

“I raised him like my own,” he said.

I didn’t know what to say, so I bowed. “Dong Dao,” I said.

He seemed put off  by the bow. A stretch ended⁠⁠—it was the final one, unbeknownst to me⁠⁠—and everyone coalesced into three rows, each of descending height from left to right.

“Attention!” yelled the coach named Shao. Everyone shifted into a perfect stance. Chin up. Chest out. “We have a new member.” She grabbed me and put a hand on my back. “He’s from America. California province.” It took a long time for her to say all the syllables in “California”⁠⁠—Jia-li-fu-ni-ya. “Let’s give him a warm welcome.” Everyone clapped. I could see their faces more clearly now. They looked lean, hungry. Everyone was around twelve, my age, give or take a few years, but there was a seriousness about their chins and their mouths that made them look older. Shao Dao said some more words about the beauty of cultural exchange, about the luck of us all to live in an international epoch of table tennis, about the emerging table tennis landscape in America. What landscape?

“How about this,” she continued. “Before we start practice today, let’s play a game. For diplomacy. Or maybe just for fun. An exhibition.”

People chuckled. Shao Dao beamed. “Any volunteers?” she asked. Every single hand shot up.

I looked at Mother in full panic. She nodded brightly. I was not ready for this. I was not warm. I hadn’t practiced in three days. I didn’t know how the ball would feel in this air pressure or humidity. I didn’t know the bounce of my new glue or how much friction this floor would produce against my shoes. Shao Dao chose someone. Everyone else moved to a comfortable position on the sidelines.

My opponent was much smaller than me. He had the fresh skin of a healthy baby and a very nice, very dense buzz cut. I had the sense that if I rubbed the top of his head with the palm of my hand, it would be an incredible sensory experience, like touching Velcro, or even better. We warmed up. Forehand to forehand. Backhand to backhand. He was a little sniffly and kept wiping his nose with the back of his hand, which he stuck out to me for a handshake.

“My name’s Liu Lian. What’s yours?” he asked.

“Liu Lian, like …” I hesitated. “Like durian, the big stinky fruit?”

“No, durian is ‘liú lián,’ second tone,” he said. “My name is Liàn, fourth tone. What’s your name?”

“I’m from America.” I didn’t know how to tell him that my name was in English and I didn’t know if it was appropriate to say my English name, that I did have a name in Chinese but it was one that I said out loud only when someone asked me, “What’s your Chinese name?” and so to say it now would give it too much importance.

“All right. Zero–zero!” yelled Shao Dao. Everyone clapped.

Two serves each. First to eleven. It was instantly clear that he was better than me. I was first to serve and my first serve was a side-underspin to his forehand. He chopped long. I looped it back, spinny, but too high. He stood his ground, waited half a beat for the ball to sink below its peak height, and counterlooped it down the line, finishing with his racket above his head. “CHO!” he yelled.

Thunderous applause.

I was down 0–3 in a blink. I thought about serving side-under again, but no⁠⁠—I had to avoid that backhand Chiquita of his. I served a low half-long pure underspin to his forehand. He tried his backhand Chiquita again and made contact, but the ball went into the net. “CHO!” I yelled. Mother was the only one who clapped.

Over the next few points, he changed his serve to reverse pendulum, and I failed miserably to tell the spin, resulting in these loose high chops that were easily smashed. I tried not to look at Mother, who was in the corner with Dong Dao, biting her lip. I changed my serve to a high-toss knuckleball, completely no spin, and hoped that he would read it as underspin and chop it. I got a few points that way, but I was still losing dramatically. 2–5. 3–8.

I’m not going to win, I thought, but I need the game to at least be close. It was 6–10. I bounced the ball up and down, thinking about the cruelty of the situation, the long days of neglect ahead of me, dismissed as the American, as a nonentity. Durian was crouched low, swinging his hips slightly from side to side. It was so quick that I might have missed it, but when we made eye contact, he smiled. I went to wipe my sweaty hand on the side of the table. Was that smile for me? I served my no-spin and he popped it straight up.

7–10. I served a heavy underspin and he chopped it into the net.

8–10. He served a flat underspin, and I chopped it fast and long into his backhand and he looped it into the net.

9–10. Is he giving me these points? I thought. He’s definitely giving me these points. But for what? He served a side-under and I chopped it back short and he used his forehand flip with such reckless power that it went out by a mile.

10–10. It was deuce now. My serve. I looked at him again and he wasn’t smiling anymore. I served a long reverse pendulum to his backhand. He stepped around, and with his forehand, looped it down the line. I didn’t touch it.

10–11. We matched backhands crosscourt for a while, which he was impossibly good at, adding spin and power to the ball, standing his ground all the while, until I played down the line, more out of impatience than strategy. With his forehand, he looped it back wide, curving it far out of my reach.

It was over. “Thanks,” I muttered as we shook hands. I looked at Mother. She didn’t look happy, of course. But she didn’t look too upset. There had been a comeback and tension and, at a cursory glance, the possibility that I could have won. Durian said nothing, but when I looked at him, he was smiling again.




The coaches had these long wooden sticks carved from branches that were so similar to one another I still wonder if maybe they were mass-produced. But what kind of company mass-produces wooden sticks to whip children with? Well, there are worse things.

These sticks were very effective⁠⁠—coated in resin, supple, and notched with protrusions, for maximum pain. Shao Dao and sometimes Dong Dao would patrol the perimeter of the tables as we trained, ten hours a day, their sticks tapping the metal ball dividers between each row of tables. Clink clink clink. When someone misbehaved, there was the satisfying SWOOSH of a whipping stick cutting through air and the unmistakable THWACK of wood on skin. Mostly, the kids were hit on the calf. Sometimes they would bleed. They kept playing, or else more lashes. I spotted some raised scars.

Mother encouraged the whipping. Dong Dao called her up one day and asked if he could, if he should, and she said yes, please. Please hit him. He called her right in front of us. We were all standing shoulder to shoulder, at attention, waiting for him to finish. He looked right at me. “Okay,” he said into the phone. “Okay, I will.”

On my first Morning Run, I ran the four thousand meters in twenty-one minutes, finishing a full lap behind everyone else. He did hit me then, for being slow, and to me it was blinding, how much it stung, but compared to some of the stuff I had seen, it was akin to a soft tap, barely leaving a mark on my leg. The other kids were in an uproar. Preferential treatment, they thought. America, they called me. That was the name that stuck. That night there were dozens of mosquitoes inside the mosquito net around my bed. How?

Mother left the day we arrived. After the game with Durian, she had sat and watched the entirety of morning practice. I was paired with Durian. We did regular single-ball drills, no different than the ones I did back home with my coach, Jake. Two points. Three points. Three points starting with underspin serve. I felt embarrassed whenever I dropped the ball or whiffed or hit the ball out, because Durian was so consistent, in this unbelievable way where each of his shots came back to the same spot no matter what I did, and so I spent the entire morning apologizing to him.

After practice, while the others were upstairs at lunch, Mother and I stood outside in the brightness, squinting at each other, our shoes burning against the hot white sand.

“All right, now. Listen to the coaches,” she said slowly. “We’ll wipe the smirk off that Maryland kid’s face. And that Indian kid from San Francisco is gonna cry all over again when he sees you. And Jake will be so happy …” She trailed off. There was something going on in her face.

“Mama?”

“Mm?” She could barely look at me.

“I’m sorry about yesterday. In the Tokyo airport, I mean.” 

“Yeah, it really hurt me.”

“I know.”

“You’re very mean to me sometimes.” 

“I know.”

“Well, I’m going now.”

“Mama, look at me,” I said. “I am going to be good. Don’t worry about me.”

“Don’t be dramatic,” she said. She turned around. She didn’t want me to see but she had started to cry. She got like this when I called her Mama. “It won’t be so long,” she said. 

I watched her go. All the way across the campus. Through all the white sand. Before she turned a corner and disappeared from view, she waved. I waved back. I jumped up and down and waved really hard.

Afterward, I went up to the dorms and sat on my new bed. It creaked under me. There were three more beds in the room, but there was nobody else here. They were all at lunch. I wanted some water, but I realized I didn’t even know how to get any. And I didn’t know if it was okay to drink tap water in China. I felt like I should ask someone about that, so I walked out to the hallway, but there was nobody. A fly buzzed. It smelled bad, like feet. The whole place smelled bad. 

I ran out of the dorms, as fast as I could, down the stairs, past the Playing Hall. Around the corner. Through the trees. I had to say goodbye to my mom one more time. 

“Ma!” I yelled. I ran and ran. I was completely out of breath. “Mama! Don’t go. Mama!” I got to the sliding gate. I looked around wildly, but she was already gone.

Sunday was our Day of Rest, apparently, which meant that there were only three hours of touch-practice in the morning, for “hand- feeling.” Then, later in the afternoon, some kids disappeared. I asked around, and someone told me that it was the day for expeditions into the city, the day to stock up on cigarettes and beer, but most importantly, porn. Porn was illegal in China, I learned, so we bought it from “old taxi drivers.” This was called “getting a cab.” I didn’t know about the logistics, because I wasn’t allowed to go. If these old taxi drivers found out I was American, I was told, they’d kill me for my organs, and I believed this.

Durian was in the same room as me. We were both top bunk. The boys were on the second floor of the dorms, the girls on the third. Shao Dao slept with us on the second floor. Dong Dao arrived in a black car every day. After morning practice and lunch, we had Nap Time, which lasted for a good two hours, and even though it was “required,” I didn’t partake. Americans don’t take naps, I wanted to tell them. Or, rather, it was that Americans view naps as a little treat. Unlike Chinese people, who view naps as functional. For the next few days, I waited until my roommates had fallen asleep before tiptoeing off the bed and out the door to explore the grounds, which were amazing to me, an alien landscape. The other buildings were empty. Nothing but the sounds of wet heat and wind. And then there was the forest. Endless grass and felled trees. I always got too scared I would lose my way, so I never got the nerve to go too deep. And plus, I needed to be back before anyone could notice I was gone.

One day I was doing just this⁠⁠—leaving the room to go outside during Nap Time⁠⁠—when a voice behind me said, “Hey.”

I turned. It was Durian. “I know I’m not supposed to be out,” I said. “But I can’t sleep.”

“Will you come take a shit with me?” he said. 

It was the first real thing he ever said to me. Maybe it was the first real thing anybody here had said to me so far. The bathroom down the hallway of the dorm was one long communal trough, no stalls, so that when you entered, it was possible, or even probable, that you would happen upon the sight of a piece of shit in the act of coming out of an asshole.

“Aren’t you supposed to be sleeping?” I asked.

“Please, I get lonely in there,” he said. He was visibly in need of a poo, bouncing around a bit, his whole face scrunched up. Maybe some of the other kids had rejected him. 

“I don’t need to take a shit,” I said. 

“Please.”

“Give me a few pages out of one of your magazines,” I said. It was a sudden moment of bravery. “Then I’ll go with you.” 

“What magazines?” he asked.

“The porn magazines,” I said. “You know, the ones you guys get on Sundays.”

He blinked, then burst out laughing. “Aiya, America. They’re lying to you. You think we’re all criminals? Fuck, you’re stupid. How’s this, you come take a shit with me, and we’ll go out next Sunday, show you what we really do.” I studied him. I did feel bad for him. So, there I was, squatting next to him with my pants around my ankles while he gritted his teeth and clenched his body. When I looked over at him, to examine his progress perhaps, his face was tight, in such a personal mixture of pain and pleasure that I couldn’t quite understand why he wanted me there at all. It was a bad poop for him. And a long one. I mean that it flowed recklessly out of him. He became increasingly lost in his own world and there was not much for me to do. I started to notice how close we were, physically. If either of us wobbled in our squat, our knees might touch.




By the end of the first week, I was still waking up in darkness from the jet lag. Both Mother and I had always spent an embarrassing number of days after plane rides feeling thin and wispy, appetite-less, struggling to stay awake at mealtimes, having slow reaction speeds, so my current failures to sleep through the night came to me as no surprise.

The red numbers on the windowsill alarm clock read four something and the others were sleeping dutifully. I listened to them for a while, the rise and fall of their breath, the creaking of metal beneath their bodies. More sleep was out of the question. I felt crisply awake. I put on my shoes quietly, grabbed my big book from my suitcase, and walked out of the dorm, feeling around for the doorknob in the moonlight.

I walked down the stairs and out of the dorms, unknown bugs humming in the night, and up the stairs that led to the back entrance of the Playing Hall. Concrete stairs with no railing and the little light bulb that was always on. I could just wait here until Morning Run started, I thought. I opened my book, but then a figure came out of the dorms and started walking toward me. There was barely enough light to see, and so for a while Durian and I were both squinting, trying to figure out who the other person was. “Why are you awake?” I asked. “San geng ban ye. In the depth of the night.”

Durian shrugged. “What’s that?” He pointed at my book. 

“It’s an astronomy textbook,” I said, holding up my huge book with a big sun on the cover. “I only had enough room for one book, and I thought I’d bring the densest, most difficult⁠⁠—”

“That’s stupid.”

“Yeah,” I said. “It’s really boring.” 

“It’s in English!” He had taken the book from me and was flipping through it.

“Well, it’s gotta be. I can’t read Chinese.”

He looked at me. “Ah, so you’re one of these ‘illiterates.’ ”

“Well⁠⁠—”

“I’ve heard about people like you,” he said. “My ma says it’s not their fault, illiterates. Not your fault, sorry. It’s ‘systemic.’ Which means it’s everyone’s fault.”

“That’s true, but I think⁠⁠—”

“Hey,” he said, “will you help me with my English homework?”

“You go to school?” I said. I thought these kids just did ping-pong, that the government pardoned them because they were going to be stars.

“What’s that supposed to mean?” he asked.

“Oh, uh⁠⁠—”

“I’m just kidding. I don’t go to school. But in case ping-pong fails, I need a little backup plan, don’t you think? Not that I’ll need it. As you know, I’m extremely talented.” 

Durian returned to the dorms and brought back an English workbook. It had lots of pictures in it, and for the rest of the time before Morning Run, we sat there and he repeated after me, word for word, slowly. “Martin,” I said. 

“Martin,” he said.

“Luther.”

“Luther.”

“King.”

“King.”

“Junior.”

“Junior.”

“Good!”

“Good! ”

“No, that’s not the next word,” I said. “That’s just me saying ‘good.’ ”

“Oh.”

I had to keep reminding him that English was the language I used the most, that my English was better than he could even comprehend. Funny, because English was actually my worst subject in school. After the school day, Mother drove me straight to the club, where practice lasted until 10 P.M. I would do homework in the car on the way back, and some days, when there was a lot of homework, Mother would do the rest of it for me, into the night, so I could get some sleep.




I woke up most days that week swimming in visceral lack, Mother, Mother, her image sitting with me squarely in the dark, and I went to practice worried that I was going to see Jake back in LA and he was going to be disappointed and turn to Mother and convey his disappointment⁠⁠—and this desire to prove to the both of them that this was working, that it was the right choice to put me here, overcame any morning sleepiness, any ache in the muscles or bones, any mid-drill respiratory failure, and every day I pushed my body as far as it would go and then some, and that is how I made it through the first week, looking at the face of Mother and the face of Jake in my mind and making both their phantom faces do the “Not bad” face, eyebrows raised, upside-down mouth.

One day, at Morning Lecture, Shao Dao read out assignments from her little notebook, and I was assigned to practice with a chopper.

“I have long pips on my backhand,” he said when we got to our table. 

“Okay,” I said, annoyed. We started warming up. Long pips is a rubber with hundreds of nasty bumps, like long, squishy braille. Against normal, smooth rubber, the kind I used, the kind most everyone uses, you loop topspin and the ball comes back topspin. But against long pips, you loop topspin and the ball comes back just as spinny, a hundred rotations per second, but in the opposite direction⁠⁠—or, in a no-spin exchange, in this floaty, erratic pattern. 

Dou Dou, that was his name, the name that he told me. “Dou, like beans?” I said. “Like legumes?”

“That’s what everyone calls me,” he said. “Little Bean.” But he was not bean-like in any way. He was thin and long, everything about him, his arms, his legs, his hands⁠⁠—classic for a chopper to have long everythings⁠⁠—and he had the clean, severe face of a model and a beautiful head shaped like an egg. He had his shirt tucked into his shorts, which were pulled high, firmly outlining his balls.

Soon I was sending the ball screaming at him and he was chopping it back, far away from the table, getting so low that his blade was at times clipping the ground. The ball came high and slow but so dense with spin that it felt like the air itself was being pulled into the ball. I used my arm, yes, but mostly my right leg and waist to hoist the ball over in a wild jolt of all my muscles combined, and that was one stroke, and then there was the next. I was losing a lot of water. There was a puddle forming on the ground. I was choking with exhaustion and there were two more hours to go. What did I do to deserve this? I thought, tearing into each ball with my entire strength.

Jake harbored a particular distaste for the chopper. I remember him telling me that he’d lost to a chopper just one time in tournament play, and he was so heartbroken that he stopped eating and sleeping and only practiced, and ever since then he had never lost to a chopper, not even when he was in the German Bundesliga. Which was untrue, obviously, but he said all this with a sneer and a threat, like, If you lose to a chopper, you’ll have disgraced me and you’ll have disgraced yourself. 

Jake wouldn’t hit me at the club, but he would talk about how much he longed to, how things would be different if we were in China. As punishment instead, he would make me do frog jumps⁠⁠—crouch, touch the floor, and jump straight up, feet off the ground⁠⁠—a hundred at a time, several times a day. It burned and it burned. Over the years my thighs became oh-so-beefy. One time, when Mother and I were fighting, she said to me, “You are nothing without him.” Which was true. The words flashed often in my mind, like a neon sign: YOU ARE NOTHING WITHOUT HIM.

I’d chosen the name Jake for him. He’d asked for a good American name. We sat down and brainstormed. I asked him what kind of vibe he was going for, and he said something young and sexy. Jake was the youngest, sexiest, and most American name I could think of. We spent a lot of time just hanging out. On my tenth birthday, he asked me where I wanted to go and I said Barnes & Noble, and he frowned and said, “Why are you such a little piece of shit?” So I thought long and hard and said, HomeTown Buffet. I sat there for two hours eating a six-thousand-calorie meal of gray and yellow while he sat across from me, not touching anything, calling me “grotesque” and “indecent” and, at one point, “perverted,” while I gobbled and gobbled.  

“At least give it a try,” I said, pushing toward him a little plate of mashed potatoes with gravy, pot roast, and mac and cheese. 

He pointed to the mac and cheese. “What’s this?” he asked.

I had no idea how to say macaroni or even cheese in Chinese. “It’s like … it’s like noodles, I guess.” He put some in his mouth, made a big display of retching, and spat it out into a napkin.

“All right,” I said, reaching for the plate. “All right.”

Once, he did hit me, though. It was the LA Open, a big-deal tournament. All these famous players came to play. Dimitrij Ovtcharov. Oh Sang-eun. By all measures, I was the favorite to win the Twelve and Under, but in the finals, I lost to this one corny-ass kid from New Jersey, Dan, who was rated lower than me and whom I’d always beaten in tournament play. When it was 1–1 and I was up 7–6, the umpire stopped the point, called fault on my serve, and gave the point directly to Corny Dan. I was caught so off guard, I lost that game 7–11. Five straight points.

“Hey, come with me,” Jake said, after the game. He was steaming, breathing loudly. We walked, not speaking, to the men’s room. I walked in first, he was right behind me, and as soon I turned around, he kicked me in the chest, Ganondorf-style. Before I hit the ground, I let out this high-pitched yelp, not because it really hurt but because I was taken aback that he would use his feet. “You fucking idiot,” he yelled. “What was that about?” He was all red in the face. Even though he was only in his late twenties, he was already balding, and you could see some of the red up in his scalp. He had a really round face, but it wasn’t flabby or loose or anything like that. In fact, it was turgid, like a GMO grape.

He was about to say something else or maybe he was going to hit me again, but at that point someone walked out of a stall and stood there, looking at the two of us, Jake towering over me on the piss-dappled floor. Jake pulled me up by an arm and gave the man a quick nod. When he continued to stand there, Jake pointed to the sink, like, Don’t you know how this works, wash your hands.

The momentum of the beating was all gone. It didn’t make sense to start up again, so we shuffled out awkwardly. Jake and I sat down on a bench outside and he started smoking. The Los Angeles sun was low to the ground. “Can I say something?” I said. “I know I’ve said this before, but I’ll practice harder.” He liked it when I said things like this. Promises. “And this time I really mean it.”

He took a deep puff of his cigarette. And then he started crying. Like, for real. 

“It wasn’t a fault. That umpire … that raised-by-a-cunt … ta ma de blind piece of shit … sha bi …” He had to catch his breath to say the next swear word. “It wasn’t a fault,” he said again. “We worked so hard. We were doing so well. And then … and then …” We sat there for a while. He couldn’t stop sobbing. A ton of people walked by and saw us⁠⁠—Jake bawling, sniveling, and me, patting him on the back. 

At the end of the three hours, at noon, Shao Dao smacked her whipping stick against the fabric of the ball divider. I was about to puke from exertion. My hands felt numb. “Game Time!” she screamed. “Game Time!” 

After practicing with Dou Dou, I decided I liked him, actually. He had all the qualities of a benevolent chopper: patience, reach, persistence, wisdom. But playing a game against Dou Dou was like playing against a mirror. Your own spin came back to you again and again with no end. Rallies were a time portal of repetition⁠⁠—I looped, he chopped, I looped, he chopped. I put my entire weight into the ball, and it nearly tore my hip every time, but somehow he was always there, impassive, perfect. 

Practice had been meditative in the end, healing even. Or at least I had understood it. The match, though, was cruel and completely impenetrable⁠⁠—pointless, like, Which one of these insane loops will do the trick? Not this one. Not this one. And even the points that I won, I couldn’t understand why. It was not a match of wit or skill⁠⁠—it was a game of who would break first. And Dou Dou did not break. After I lost, I sat on the floor and wept. The Playing Hall was empty by then. Everyone else was at lunch. I cried stupidly. I wanted so badly to see Mother. I wanted her to float through that door. Mama, I don’t want to play anymore. I want to lie down. I want you to take me away from here.

Shao Dao came back into the Playing Hall to turn off the lights. She looked at me on the ground. “You lost?”

I nodded, crying harder.

She sighed. “It’s lunchtime,” she said. “Come.”




Durian kept a plastic folder in his pillowcase, and when he slept, I guess in order to not crush the papers inside with the weight of his head, he would take the folder out and sleep with it in his hands. And so every night he slept perfectly still, kind of like a mummy, with his hands crossed over his body, clutching the folder. In the morning he put it back inside the pillowcase.

“What is that?” I asked him one night, before lights-out.

He showed me, opening the folder to reveal a single sheet of paper. It was a pencil drawing of a naked girl on her knees. And a voluptuous cock next to her. But she was looking at me. And that was a turning point for me. A moment of complete immersion. The technique was exquisite, reminiscent of a Rembrandt portrait, the details impossibly fine and dense and dark. What I remember most, however, are the eyes, which, like those of Velázquez’s Meninas or Picasso’s Demoiselles, held your gaze and rendered you inseparable from the art. And in a flash those eyes grounded you, physically, emotionally⁠⁠—knew everything about you, all of you, your secrets, your shame.

This was not the drawing of some middling artist⁠⁠—no, this was a masterwork. I understood at once the mummy sleeping, the pillow protection.

“How?” I asked. 

“Dou Dou,” he said.

“And where did Dou Dou get this?” I asked. 

“He drew it,” said Durian.

“Fuck off.” 

“It’s true.”

“Fuck you,” I said. “And fuck your mother.” 

“America, when have I ever lied to you?” 

“What? All the time.”

“Okay, but Dou Dou drew this. I paid him for it. I watched him do it.” 

I stood there, considering this. I looked at the drawing some more. Something else: there was no element of exaggeration. That was another thing that kept the attention, the honesty of the work. “I’m sure he’s in his room. He’ll tell you,” said Durian. He took my hand and led me out of the room and down the hall and into another room, and sure enough, there Dou Dou was, sitting on his bed, waiting for a kettle to boil. He was about to have some instant ramen. And behind him, in what little space he had, there was a poster of the Korean player Joo Sae-hyuk, the best chopper of all time. Nobody else had decor. I hadn’t even thought of it. How much would a poster cost?

Durian was a little nervous, I could tell. “America here is curious about your business.” He turned to me. “Tell him.”

“You showed him?” Little Bean was visibly displeased.

“Yes, well …” Durian stumbled. “I mean, no. America, he doesn’t know how things work. He grabbed it out of my hands.”

“Is that true?” said Dou Dou. He turned to me. 

“Yes,” I lied. 

 “Next time,” he said, “please know that that is unfair to both the customer and my work. A lot of it is about a customer’s personal connection with the piece.”

“I don’t understand. Where did you learn how to draw like this?”

“Oh, it’s nothing,” he said, but he was certainly proud. “There’s an inherent satisfaction in producing quality that the customers will return for. And the money. Better quality means better money.” He pointed to the kettle, which had achieved a boil. “And after the price of the paper and pencils and whatnot … it’s a wonder I don’t charge more.” He lifted the kettle from its base and poured water into the paper bowl. 

“Dou Dou,” I said. “You know, this is … this is real. You have a real talent.”

“Thank you.”

“No, I mean,” I said, gaining confidence, “it’s a real gift you have. You should go to Beijing, to the Central Academy of Fine Arts.” I had watched a YouTube video about that place. “Or New York. Or Paris. Yeah, Paris. You know, Paris is the center of art.” I was getting a bit heated. I didn’t know if what I was saying was right anymore. 

“And what would I do in Paris?” he asked.

“What do you mean?” I said. “You could be famous!”

“I don’t wanna hear this,” said Dou Dou. Beside me, Durian slid down with his back against the wall and sat on the floor.

“How many kids are there like us? Ten thousand? A hundred thousand? A million? C’mon, Durian, back me up.” I looked at him, on the floor. He said nothing.

“Two days ago, I almost beat Li Kai,” said Dou Dou. Li Kai was, some might say, our best player.

He was injured, I wanted to say. And you’re a chopper. A stubborn, brilliant chopper, but still a chopper. Even Joo Sae-hyuk was only ever a bronze medalist at the World Cup. You have something none of us have, I wanted to say. What are you doing in a place like this?

Instead, I said, “Let’s be for real. You’re never gonna beat Li Kai.” 

“America,” said Durian.

Dou Dou considered this for a moment. He smoothed over the papery lid of the ramen. “If you’re not gonna buy, get out of my room,” he said, finally. The ramen was ready. He peeled back the lid and started to eat, slowly.

Later, when we were back in our room, I said to Durian, “I’m sorry I let it out that you showed me.” 

“Oh, don’t worry,” he said. “Secretly, he wants people to see. It’s good publicity.”

Later, after lights out, I jerked off under the blankets, trying to be as silent as possible, not in a lusty, sexual way, but thinking about Dou Dou’s mastery of his craft, his long chopper hands gripping a pencil, his calm demeanor, his successes on and off the table, his wasted potential.




I had barely drifted off when Durian shook me awake. “Come with me,” he said.

By then, I was sleeping deep. Squinting through my grogginess, I could see that it was dawn-ish. There was enough light that I could make out Durian’s figure, already dressed. The alarm clock read five ten.

Zhang Bo Lun stirred in his bed. He was one of our roommates. He slept beneath Durian. We liked to call him Da Lunzi, or Big Wheel. I tended to stay out of his way⁠⁠—he always smelled a bit like cheese. “Where are you two going?” he murmured.

I didn’t know, so I said, “Go back to sleep.”

Durian and I walked to the Playing Hall, blades underneath our armpits. I wanted to ask him what we were up to, but it was too early and I was too sleepy, and it felt too nice to not say anything. I watched him lace up his shoes, which were the ubiquitous blue ones with the yellow stripe, the ones for little kids. I wore my white Mizuno Wave Drives everywhere, in the dining hall, in the dirt. 

“Do you know Kobe Bryant?” he asked. 

“Do I know Kobe Bryant?”

“Okay, so Kobe Bryant is this really famous basketball player. Everyone in China knows about him. Everyone. That’s how good he is.”

“Durian, I know who⁠⁠—”

Durian held up a finger, as if to say, Not now. “Kobe Bryant once said that talent is a big lie. It’s all about who works the hardest, who practices more. He gets to practice at four in the morning, hours before anyone else.”

“Fuck no. I’m going back to sleep.” I stopped in my tracks. “Goddammit, Durian, I thought we were gonna jump the gate or you were gonna show me some secret thing or … or we were gonna assassinate Dong Dao or something.”

“Assassinate Dong Dao?”

“It’s just an example. I meant I thought we were doing something exciting.” I turned to leave.

“This is exciting,” he said, grabbing me by the arm. “Look at us, we’ve beat everyone. In a way, we win. Right here, right now. Isn’t that exciting?”

“No.”

“Okay, okay, don’t go. We won’t do anything exhausting. We won’t do multiball. But I really think it would be useful to practice serves. Don’t you think it’s stupid that we never actually do that during practice? It might very well be the most important part of the game. Stay for a little? Please?” 

So I stayed, the two of us side by side in the dark, practicing our serves from a big bucket. It was a strange new feeling, this private act, just Durian and me practicing in the empty Playing Hall. In LA, in group classes or with Jake, practice, for me, had always been a performance with an audience of one. Now there was no Mother, and I understood this consciously, but still, during a particularly exceptional serve, when the ball floated just barely above the net and the second bounce landed precisely on the edge of the table, I swiveled around to receive her nod. 

When I’d won the Ten and Under at Nationals in Las Vegas, Mother had been nowhere to be found. Over a period of several days and several tables, of sleeping lockjawed each night and rising hungry and wordless each morning to gnaw on my free tournament-sponsored banana, I’d made it, a miracle, all the way to the final table, where, on all four sides, extending far and up into the aluminum bleachers, were my teammates and my enemies, their moms and coaches, sports journalists and balding white guys, so many random people. 

And where was Mother? Lost in prayer, probably, pacing somewhere for the infinite hour of my game, not able to look, buried deep underneath the mountain of simple want and fear, not that I would have stretched my vision midgame to search for her in the crowd. I was doing well in the game, such that any glimpse of her would have been too disturbing, would have ruined this improbable streak I was on and shattered that precarious balance. Because winning, the act of being up and winning: it’s not a situation, not a thing, but something to follow, a sudden glowing path that, if I looked away from it, would disappear.

And the winning point, the smell of that moment, the sound of it, down 7–9 in the fifth and then four straight points, winning on a counterloop, the feeling of it rising in my chest and up to my throat⁠⁠—Mother’s scream, from somewhere, rising high and strange into the rafters. Mother rounding the corner from the periphery, running over to put her arms around me, and afterward, Mother and I roaming the Las Vegas strip, ducking into Bellagio, prancing around the Christmas-themed botanical gardens, pressing our faces against the glass at the Patisserie chocolate fountain, laughing, hugging each other at random intervals, not knowing what to do with all our joy, looking at each other in moments of silence and breaking out into smiles.

After that, I was the best ten-year-old in the United States, better than anyone in Chicago or Philly or Houston or Miami, better than anyone in New York City, better than anyone in New Jersey, better than anyone in Southern California, think about it, even Alhambra, even Arcadia, Cerritos, Diamond Bar, Monterey Park, Rosemead, Rowland Heights, San Gabriel, Walnut, even, if you can believe it, Irvine. Yes, even better than any and every Asian American child in the goddamn Bay Area⁠⁠—Milpitas, Fremont, Daly City, San Jose⁠⁠—fuck those kids, by the way. It was me, strutting into tournaments, all the parents whispering to their kids, kids whispering to their parents⁠⁠—That’s him, that’s the best kid.

But now that I was twelve, I was not the best twelve-year-old. I wasn’t even second. According to the USATT National Rankings page in USA Table Tennis magazine, I was fifth, clinging onto fifth, afraid every day of sliding further down into irrelevance, as if the inertia of that downward motion had already become so deeply entrenched as to render that first-place spot irrecoverable. The boy who was first in my age group back home, Kanak Jha, stayed in first for the rest of our boyhood, then went on to become the GOAT of American table tennis, winning Nationals six times (the Men’s Singles, not the kids’ events). He was also, at fifteen, the youngest-ever table tennis Olympian, competing in Rio 2016, then Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024, where he made it to the top sixteen, the furthest by far that any American has made it in the Men’s Singles, losing that game 0–4 to Fan Zhendong, the eventual gold medalist. And on the northeast corner of Hester and Allen in Manhattan, which many times in my life I’ve passed by, there’s a huge mural of him, twenty feet tall, maybe twenty-five, painted on the side of the wall. And how is that supposed to make me feel?

Still, we had to try, Mother and I, not because we were absolutely convinced it was doable to be back in first, but because this was our lives. 

The reds and blues poured in through the windows of the Playing Hall, coloring in the darkness bit by bit. Just the day before, we had broken out a slate of fresh balls, so there were the exciting marks of newness⁠⁠—chalky white circles⁠⁠—accumulating in the same places on our rubbers and on the table. Durian liked to stomp the ground with his right foot every time he served. He had just shattered a ball underfoot that way, and now we could smell the sick-sweet camphor as we served.

I started to notice that, when I served a no-spin reverse pendulum, there was a slight upward kick at the second bounce. Could I serve, for the whole game, very spinny reverse pendulums, and then, at a crucial moment⁠⁠—say, 9–9 or deuce⁠⁠—serve a no-spin using the same motion? Loosen the grip at the moment of contact, rather than squeeze? It occurred to me, perhaps for the first time, that ping-pong, considered alone, could be pleasurable, that if the ball struck the rubber deep and true, it could feel good in the hand, that if I could make the ball go precisely where I wanted it to, it was like having a power that others didn’t. And maybe that in and of itself could be good.

It was almost time for Morning Run, but I found myself not wanting to go. I was getting used to a certain rhythm: tsk, bounce, bouncebounce, hissssssssss. Tsk, bounce, bouncebounce, hissssssssss into the back of the net. Just one more serve before Morning Run, just one more. I was on the verge of figuring something out. I had almost solved some problem."
